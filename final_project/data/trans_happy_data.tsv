My mom came to visit me because I’ve been going through a hard time in my personal life and she decided to tell me that she and all of her friends miss the old me. I no longer agree to disagree with people regarding my own happiness so I sent her home. it hurt, but I’m proud of myself.		"Be proud be happy and you have my support & respect for the person for who you are & not what you should be
You matter more than her and her friends, especially their “thoughts”. Like who says that especially when you are already going through a hard time. You did the right thing and good for you for doing it! I hope you get through this hard time.
always sets me on edge when people start with the whole ‘we miss the old you’ spiel. like, you miss when the i was depressed? compliant? willing to let the blatant disrespect slide?

good on you for sending her away, even when it hurt. definitely worth being proud of :)
Moms do not get a free pass.
Good for you! You deserve better.
happiness looks good on you. there is no old you, only the wrong you
If they miss “the old you” they miss someone who doesn’t exist. We’d all miss the true you if you compromised. Stay yourself, please.
You are absolutly gorgeous girl keep being you.
Then they can keep on missing ""the old you"", your happiness comes first.
Hello, I am a mom of an incredible trans man. I wanted to tell you that at first I sucked as a mom and did not immediately accept him. But he quietly persevered and patiently kept telling me who he was meant to be. It took this stupid old woman a long time to understand that he was telling me how awesome he would be if I only just let him be who he was. When my husband and I finally accepted him, we were blessed with the opportunity to see what an amazing young man he really was and how all his anxiety and depression melted away when he was allowed to flourish in the body that he truly belonged in. So be patient and stand up for yourself as many times as it takes until your parents learn to love you as you really are, or you decide that you have tried enough and should move on.  Those who truly love you will come around and see the truth. Those who don't will not be a part of your life.  Be true to yourself and fight the good fight. It is so very worth it!!!  Be safe and love yourself!  That's all that matters.
Sorry things are rough rn and I hope they turn around for you soon but I gotta say your eyeliner game is *on. point.* Got any tips?
Good on you for setting your boundaries. My mom said similar things to me as well and eventually there was a breaking point. It’ll hurt setting your distance but they may never know how much these unsolicited opinions stick with us. We’re better off setting boundaries and keeping distance when these things are said, otherwise you just expose yourself to these “worries” more which inevitably wears down our mental health.

Stay strong, you’ve always been the same person. The “old” you doesn’t define you, only YOU define you.
""My old me was sad and hated themselves. I don't know why you would like something like that. Except for your own comfort""

That is what I have heard other say and most parents felt very attacked and often stopped contacting them.

So if that is a goal, try that :3
Congratulations, your truly amazing 👏 ❤️ 💖
You don't need that toxicity in your life.  Good for you to send her packing.  The audacity of her to visit to ""support"" you and then use your vulnerable state to tell you how others miss the old you.  As if it is somehow going to change your mind. Sounds a lot like it is their problem.  

Sorry this stuff really grinds my gears so apologies if I come off to strong.

So proud of you even though I know it hurts to do that.   Always advocate for yourself.  You are beautiful and deserve a happy life.
The old you never existed, you now is who was always inside you!
I wonder if her friends really feel that way or if she's just trying to use them against you. Either way, don't listen, pal. You're fine no matter what.
I'm sorry to hear that but be true to yourself and keep going to find happiness love!😊😉
Congratulations! I know that hurts though. Hope she will change her mind. You made the right choice, so proud of you. Take care.
Good boundaries 🖤 Hope things improve for you
You go, queen.

Remember that setting and abiding by boundaries always FEELS aggressive, but it’s not.You were passive before so taking control seems hostile, but it’s simply you taking power over your life.
If they miss the ""old"" you, they only ever knew you skin deep. That's on them.
It’s ok 4 parents to miss the “old you”
But they also have to respect and love the “REAL you!” I had my struggles with my mom, thankfully were in a better place! I hope one day you and her can celebrate, cherish and love YOU!!! After reading the comments ur loved boo ! Muah love Auntie T 💕💕💕
Family is people that treat you like family... biology is only tangental to that.
She had a beautiful daughter, can she just open her eyes and see how pretty you’re???
good for you darlin. who needs that shit?
Making boundaries and advocating for yourself is one of the most difficult things in the world but also one of the most important. You deserve to be proud of yourself, and I think everyone on this sub is proud of you too. Keep your head high, sister. ❤️
You do you. I know im a total stranger n usually just a lurker here. I just wanted to say im proud of you too!
Good for you, my friend. Sometimes self love requires carving out space from family/friends for our own happiness. Can’t make an omelette without cracking a few eggs ;)
Love yourself girly 🙏🖤 at the end of the day you know who you truly are and thats wht truly matters. They need to live in the present fr. respectfully of course 😇
You did the right thing, i am proud of you too 😌
That must have hurt like hell, feel hugged by me 
Much love ❤️
I’m proud of you for holding that boundary. I hope things start to look up. 🖤
You are so beautiful
Sorry you had to go through that but glad you had the self respect and strength to do what is best for you
You are so beautiful!! (M22) and I've recently come to the conclusion that I'm pansexual and it makes me feel better to be able to fully appreciate the beauty in the lgbtq community knowing I don't have to question anything anymore. Don't feel undermined from the feeling of non acceptance. You are you!!
Wow. I can’t tell you were born a different gender than what I’m seeing here. Great job! Hope you’re happy:)
So you’ve been going through a hard time, and instead of being there for you, she decided to tell you that BS?!? Wow! You deserve so much better, especially from your own Mom. She doesn’t deserve to have you in her life if that’s how she’s going to treat you. I’m happy for you that you sent her home. If you ever need to talk feel free to reach out to me. 🫶🏼
Always be yourself. Don’t let the haters hate.
🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂
I'm sorry that happened to you, it's not easy.... Good on you for choosing yourself though.
I wish I was brave enough to do this. But my mom has told me that she would…. End it all if I leave her so I just… feel like I have to stay, even if it kills me in the end
What a Queen move 👑 
That had to take considerable strenght! 
You should be proud of yourself
Girl, you're stunning and deserve to be loved as you are.  Plus, when will people just stop and realize that you are still you. The only difference is now the body matches the heart and mind.  That's like being upset because you stopped wearing a pair of pants that you once owned.  Good for you hun you slay life and never let anyone make you feel like you are less.
“Oh you missed the old depressed me who faked their smile? What you saw was fake cause I didn’t want you to worry. I’m just finding the me where I can smile and mean it.”
You look gorgeous and I’m sorry you have a mom that says stuff like that, she should know better
Wait... they... want you to not be the beautiful woman you are?!?! Are they insane?
I am sorry that you felt that you needed to do that... I am very happy that you were able to do it. 

One of the hardest things we have to do is to be firm with family that just cannot come to grips that history is history and today is today...

You must be true to yourself and it sounds like you understand this...

I hope things get better for you soon...

If you want to talk with an old trans- grandmother, who has lived through some of the things you may be facing...

Feel free to DM me any time...

My best
Bonner
Girlboss. You pass really well btw❗️
How in Lucifers name can one even tell that to someone they love, let alone their child?

It'd be like if my brother changed his name and i said ""I miss Anthony"" to his face. Makes no damn sense.

You're freakin gorgeous btw, supermodel material.
How could anyone prefer the “old you”? You’re still the same person. You may look different, but mentally you have always been a woman, right? I hope the only difference is that you’re happier. (also you are absolutely gorgeous omfg)
If I looked like you, I too would send someone packing if they said they miss the old me. You're total goals.
""We miss the old you"" you mean, you miss the status quo, the supposed picture of me that you had in your head that is nothing similar to actual, real person that is me? 
Bruh I can't stand this type of people, sorry you had to deal with it.
Well done. I'm sorry to hear your mother couldn't put aside her garbage when you needed her. It sounds like you did the smart and strong thing.
Too bad they never get to know the real you. I'm proud of you. If they don't appreciate a beautiful butterfly there are those of us who do. Be you. Love and hugs.
Why can't our literal parents just accept us and not be pricks about it
You made the right choice. Even though she might felt hurt, your happiness isn’t up for debate!
Hey op I don’t think I knew the old you, but I certainly love and am inspired by the new you.  

I Love your strength and confidence to stand up for yourself and to be proud of yourself. 

I don’t know if a lot of people share my same experience. But before my egg cracked I was meek, ashamed of myself, and wrought with depression and existential dread. But now that I’ve seen a glimpse of the real me, of what I can become I’m empowered, happy, confident, glowing.

To everyone who reads this: you have the strength to love yourself, be brave, fuck the haters, live your best life, live your truth (whatever that truth is, regardless of gender or sexuality). And best of all: you don’t owe anyone anything when it comes to your gender or how to express it, except maybe yourself, you probably should owe it to yourself. (I kinda ran out of steam there at the end 🤷‍♀️😢)
""I have d cups, the waiter thinks you have dimentia grandma""
That’s a tough move to have to make but people missing the old you are people not seeing who you are or who you can become so you gotta do what you gotta do. You’re who you’re supposed to be 💜
Good for you girl.  Stay true to yourself.  💕🎀
Hey... I'm proud of you.

Signed: MommaBear.
Its ok honey. Your doing great.
The ""old me"", missed the ""new me"" for my entire life, and is in a better place, which is within the body, of a person who can express themselves freely.
That's heart wrenching! I'm so sorry :( good on you for holding true to yourself and sending beer home, I don't know if I would be able to do the same.
Missing the old you? No, you are you and there is no other you!

Even though it's never easy, my mom will never say that I'm lost to anyone let alone me, because nobody is lost. Instead the world gained someone, as you finally express yourself fully. It would be so nice if we let people exist in full instead of forcing people to live in zombie/autopilot mode to repress expression.
holy shit you are incredibly pretty
Good for u. Also u look so cute..
[removed]
Girl, when you look like that, who gives a shit what other thing. Why would you ever wanna be anything else?
So sad and annoying when we get told this sort of crap. I've lost 70+ pounds and my mom just told me, you were so handsome before and I said nit sure. I was so fat, I look much better (1 yr hrt)  she said well, that was the only thing...
[removed]
it so cuuuuute
Why is it that men transition to female and are all about competing against women but you never hear about women transitioning to male and wanting to compete against men??
U sure ure not Trans
I’d like to meet the new you.
You matter more than your mum's perceived version of yourself
Your nails are so pretty 🤩 how can your mom and old friends not see how happy they make you? How you feel so wonderful in your clothes. Cis people just need to let their own issues go
Omg! Your mom is a terrible person for not seeing the beautiful daughter right in front of her! You made the right decision!
I'm proud of you too.. oh and you are by far one of the most gorgeous woman on the face of the planet..
Hang in there.

I had to do something similar with an ex recently...but seriously if I'm bothering you, don't talk to me... like duh
You’re amazing
Good job
It’s your life not theirs!  You are absolutely fantastic and incredible. You can do anything!
Awful, that's legit terrible she had to tell you that when you showed them your true self, which is beautiful and righteous.  Don't let her tell you otherwise, you're perfect as you are.
I’m proud of you!!!
Your gorgeous and their mean. You made the right move.
Thats manipulative as fuck. Fuck parents who try to control their kids. I dont get it and I never will.
Transformers W
good for you!!!
We love you for being you even if others don’t
Your happiness should always be priority in your life. As long as you're not hurting people intentionally, you should always have time to focus on yourself.

Also, love the nails. I'm a nail gal myself
Very beautiful
Our lives are not a game of what other people think we should do.

Wouldn't it be nice if people could see the truth?

That our ""old selves"" was just a husk of a shell we had been hiding in.

Well done establishing boundaries and enacting them.

Have a wonderful day / evening.
That sucks and I’m so sorry. If it helps any, you look absolutely beautiful and happy with yourself and that’s what really counts in life.
But the old you wasn't you.  It's ok to miss it, I guess, but it's not ok to deny you being you 

And after a while, it's not ok to tell you they miss the not you you.
Good for you! Sorry you sad times! Hope she snaps out of it soon! 🤗
Aren’t you the same person she knew internally? Your appearance just changed and possibly a legal name change. What’s different that they want back? No one gets a free pass for stuff like that. Your soul and personality or who you are hasn’t changed just your outward appearance. I’m sorry people have to be this way in society today still.
one of my fave songs helped me get through a similar experience: jaime brooks (as default genders) - ""sophie""

you did the right thing - in my work i see all the time how parents, just in general, often have a tough time seeing their children as something that isn't a part of them, and under their control. this gets exacerbated the more distinct their children's identity is from their own. it's their failure to love - not the child's. wishing you all the best!!
Well, I don’t know you, so I can’t comment on “the old you.” But the “new you” seems pretty awesome, so it seems like your mom and all of her friends are missing out. Too bad for them I guess. Keep being your awesome self. Who knows, maybe they’ll come around to seeing just how awesome you are someday. If not, fuck em.
Self-love and self-care are the most important things in our lives. Transitioning has made you a better person, a happier one, it's made you who you really are inside and out! If someone can't see that, and wants to act selfish, they should expect to be treated that way. 🫂
It's almost like saying they missed seeing u in pain. That's gotta hurt... i know my family members are going to bring it up to me sooner or later, just cuz i got a feeling that that's something they would say (out of concern for my ""wellbeing/future"" 🤷🏼‍♀️😒)

Thank you for sticking up for urself like this,... proud of u too ! 👊😊
Their just jealous because your so damn gorgeous  !
I don’t know who the old you was, but I don’t miss them.
Yeah, she is manipulative and some other crazy mechanics , toxic .

We're proud of you , stand up for yourself girl!
Well done you, in my opinion you did the right thing here. If it where me I would do the same.
You are beautiful
Be proud always of who you are. I had to sadly cut a lot of family off.  I have been in your shoes before. Sometimes the pain comes and goes in waves but I promise you'll be happier in the long run.
So happy for you. You're so strong and inspiring. I hope to be as strong as you one day!
I feel your pain, being trans sometimes produces this difficulty we have balancing our needs with the feelings of others which is unique to us, no one else understands what that's like and I envy those who's loved ones accept them. Stay strong honey 🤗
I met up with my mom recently after her taking my transition roughly at the beginning and I feel you so hard. Dead named to my face after multiple corrections and told ""I'm always going to be [REDACTED] to her so why bother saying my new name.""
Just remember you are the only person whose opinion matters.
You were going through a hard time and she came by to make it worse? What the fuck is wrong with her?
I'm proud of you too!
It’s a short life and nothings more important than being your authentic self for the journey.
Looking at this photo, I'm having a very hard time believing there WAS an ""old you"" 😮  

& in case you're wondering,  hell no I don't hugbox placate , if I have nothing nice to say about a pic I say nothing.
Well done, this is something to be proud of - as much as it hurts.

You deserve to be treated with basic human decency, and she chose to violate that.
Holy shit you're pretty
The old me doesn’t live here anymore, bye 👋
 Good for you! If she loves you she should totally respect that
I’m sorry your mom can’t fully appreciate the beautiful daughter she has😔

I’m still closeted an only out to my mom and a couple others. She’s always said she supports me but somehow I know that one day I’ll hear something similar💔
I’m proud of you, too! No patience for anyone who tells you that you aren’t *you.*

Who else but you has the right to appoint themselves an expert on what makes you most comfortable in your own skin?
Sorry your mom said that to you.  Be proud of who you are becoming. Hopefully she'll learn to love the new you.
Super proud of you, that would be hard for anyone to turn a parent away but we will always be there for our sisters! 👑
Wow your eyeliner gurl!! I am jealous
Good for you.
You're so beautiful and confident how do you do it 😭
You’re awesome the way you are. 💙🤗💟🏳️‍⚧️
Holy crap. Talk about kicking you while you're down. That's awful.
Well done...you're absolutely stunning
It’s really not fair that some people have such supportive families and others don’t, sorry that you have to go through that.  

I think though that at the end of the day, when you are in bed and alone and in your own thoughts, that is the voice that we need to be honest to.  Everything else is transient
Well that's their loss because you're a queen. Fuck them.
You got this
Good for you!
Good for you
Well your mother and all her old friends can go suck on their pearls because you loving who you are is the only thing that matters.
I don't know you, but I'm proud of you. Your happiness comes first always! Nobody, not even family, can take that away from you
Good for you! That’s such a difficult thing to do. I hope that your mom learns from this and begins to understand how deeply statements like that can hurt.
Guess she won the game of who is going to the retirement home
People who cannot accept change are fools consumed by idiocy
I am proud of you too sister!!!!
It sucks that your mom wasn't showing you support. Just have to remember the most important thing in life is your happiness. Don't let the negativity get you down
Good for you for setting boundaries. What your mom said was manipulative and disrespectful. 


You are a beautiful and valid woman and you deserve people in your life who recognize that! Best wishes
I just started the journey. I’m on the older side (37), and I get this from people in my life. They say that they’ll miss the old me or still see the old me. It has not been what I’ve needed to hear in my first two months of hormones. I’m sorry that you’re going through that. Sending love your way!
Oh my god, you look gorgeous!
You are gorgeous and be proud of the person you are babe and don’t let anyone ever tell you anything different.
You're gorgeous, be strong
I'm super proud of you too!  Healthy boundaries for the win.
You _should_ feel proud.

And, I know I’m risking misinterpretation in a comment, without additional context, so please believe that I mean this sincerely: I ran across this post on r/all and didn’t understand it at first, only noticing the sub after reading the headline. With all the positivity I have, you look amazing. 

I hope your increasing happiness, courage, pride, and confidence approach even half of the glow you radiate. Your true life is ahead of you.
Full support
Ironically I moved away and my mother wishes to be closer to me now that she knows im Trans.
you did the right thing
You go girl.  Hang in there
Good for you. I hope you have a family of choice around you who loves and supports you. Also, I love your eye makeup!
Ur so pretty dont listen to her , she just can't deal with the changes  so flip her
F#@& yes!
Sorry if this comes off mean it’s supposed to be in support of you, YOUR MOMS A BITCH
That was the right choice. Gotta stay proud and have respect for yourself. Stay strong friend.
Continue being your amazing self. You are valid.
Don’t let the haters tell you what to do! ❤️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
There is no ""old"" you, there's only one you and it's the life you're living now. The ""old"" you they miss was just their own misguided expectations of who you are. You're an amazing person and just keep being true to yourself.
good for you! also your smile is gorg!
Some people also miss Windows Vista so...
Sometimes you gotta tell people to either get on board with who you truly are or get left behind, you don't have time to wait for them to catch up because you need to keep moving forward for you
First of all, you're gorgeous. Second, I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself. You'll find people who love you for who you are. I don't talk to my parents anymore, but I've met so many new people willing to be like family to me.
So freaking proud of you!!!
:( i hope you’re okay
I am proud of you for standing up for yourself. You need to make a stand for your own journey, and your own happiness, and you did well. ❤️❤️❤️
I'm proud of you too!
U are absolutely gorgeous
your are stunningly gorgeous. keep true to your self and your happiness will always shine.love this photo
Be proud of who you are 🏳️‍⚧️ also off topic but you're actually gorgeous
Good for you! Very manipulative of your mother to come at you like when you’re vulnerable. They need to deal with that stuff on their own and let you be.
You probably won't see this, but I'm proud of you Caily...
Big hugs, well done putting your happiness first
There is no old you, there is only you! You are doing great, I am so proud!
Proud of you too ❤️ That’s hard to do, but good on you :)
You’re beautiful! Your happiness is more important than anyones acceptance
I went through therapy and got rid of all the toxic people in my life. Unfortunately they were my family.
You are same person as before just in a different package, the contents hasn’t changed.
I'm proud of you too!
What/who is the old you?
Is it weird for me to say that I can't imagine you as anything else but this?  I don't know you as anyone else, and I can't imagine you as anyone else.  And it doesn't bother me for one second.

Hi only you .
I'm proud of you too!
So proud of you for respecting and loving yourself!!
I’m so proud of you girlie 🥹
It is totally ridiculous when people think they are being subtle with their hate.
When she cares more about her friends than her daughter 💀
Hey Mom.  This cannot be undone.  It’s a one way street.  I’m a She/Her forever.  The me now is the me you get.
Well done for standing up for your self! If she misses the ""old you"" she can stay in your past. You gave her a chance to help you in a bad time, and she took that opportunity to hurt you, even if ""she didn't mean it like that"", it's your life and you can have whomever you want in it, and cut out anyone you want too.
Go you!
off topic. you’re really gorgeous
I'm very proud of you young lady
Goddamn! Sorry you had to deal with bullshit like that. Glad you were able to stand up for yourself though!
You should be proud of yourself
Du bist eine wunderschöne Frau und ich würde dich gerne näher kennenlernen
Hell yeah, you’re valid!
fuck haters smoke trees (weed) you are fabulous!!!
Imagine being upset that your angelic trans daughter is doing well for herself and has beauty that radiates from within. L mom
It is your life after all. If your mom can't accept you even if she doesn't understand then yes it will hurt asking a family member not to come over if all they're going to do is argue and belittle. You are a beautiful woman. How you feel about yourself and loving yourself is important. Sometimes you just can't make some people happy but you don't need the negative in your life.
Proud of you gorgeous!
I'm sorry your mom decided to try and rain all over you today. I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself, and sending her home. You deserve love, respect and acceptance from those who care for you. Saying they miss the cocoon you grew up in is extremely dismissive of the shining light of who you are now and always have been. 💜
I second this statement ❤️
Seventh this statement ❤️‍🩹
I fifteenth this statement. 🖤🖤🫶🏻🫶🏻
I always used to think she meant well just delivered things bad but honestly if someone can look me in the eyes and say they miss the version of myself that was miserable there’s really no good way to take that.
I hate to see so many people relate to this topic because it really sucks, but in a way it feels good that someone understands
I miss the the you from when you were miserable is a weird thing to say, specially to your own daughter.
I find it so irritating you are the same person as before just happier...
Agreed!!! Expanding on that - Noone gets a free pass!!!
You have to be able to cut toxic people out of your life, whoever they are. Thank goodness for mental health awareness. I suppose it can be pretty difficult for some people, especially older generations, to understand that.
Honestly that was pretty close to what I told her myself
Wow. Usually people who used to suck still try to force everyone to wait for others to catch up. It's refreshing and rare for me to see someone get when others device to cut folks like the old you off.
I use a brush tip eyeliner from NYX because I feel like it gives a sharper line than a felt tip personally. I also have a slightly hooded eye so I have to do the bat wing thing to where it looks normal with my eyes open but closed it kinda jumps up to accommodate the hood part
I try to use analogies with people because sometimes it’s hard for them to grasp a concept. I said something along the lines of “what if I told you I missed who you were with your abusive ex husband?”. That sort of made a slight impression but she still doesn’t fully grasp it
That is a good question honestly but either way not what I wanted to hear lol
I’m sorry to hear that sweetheart. I hope you realize how toxic behavior like that is. When someone puts their lives essentially on your shoulders as a bargaining token, that isn’t love, that’s obedience
Her telling you that is a textbook abuse tactic, and a sign that she probably should seek professional help.  She alone is responsible for her actions.

Please, for your own sake, get the fuck away from her the instant you safely can do so.
Most people that actually threaten suicide will never actually do it. That is a huge manipulation tactic that narcissists use, and use often. It’s a guilt trip is all. 

Just tell her if she doesn’t want you to leave then she needs to fucking respect you.
And to be apart society with no judgement
She's happy and her mom and her mom's friends preferred her sad. OP probably put up with her mom's bullshit more and spoke up less when she was sad.
That would genuinely make me sad that my happiness brings anyone, especially my mother sadness. Unfortunately it’s my life and I’m navigating it to the best of my ability. 😌
I guess my inner child still aches for love and acceptance from my mom sometimes
I don’t consider myself in competition with anyone and would hope others wouldn’t think the same against me either. I don’t like to think of things in such generalizations personally.
I’m sure
Lol I don’t know about that but I appreciate it lol
WOMEN (no longer) IN DISGUISE
i third this statement ❤️
I will eighth the statement
Yeah I would be offended and angry. I know I wouldn’t do that to a kid of mine if I had one. I would accept them and want them to be happy and want to help them be happy.
It means that it’s more about them and what they want than you and your happiness.  You did the right thing to send her away to avoid them dragging you down.  The unspoken part is they dislike who you are now, which is pure insanity, seeing how radiant and beautiful you are.  Just be amazing by continuing to be you!  🦊💕
Whats disgusting is she cares more about her own happiness than about your well-being. It feels so narcissistic and evil. Im sorry yoy had to hear that from your own ""mother""
Exactly. Hope you sent her packing with I resounding ""Well I don't!""

Why do any of us keep holding onto friends, families, or jobs that make us fucking miserable???!?  I finally found a job where I'm treated with respect and paid reasonably well.  I've got friends in my neighborhood that are way better than most of our collective families (spouse and I), and stopped reaching out to the angry people I used to call friends that just were angry all the time and complained all the time and nothing else.

You do you.  You only get one today so be happy in it. I know you've heard that. But think about this... Our world only gets one you so be happy in that too!!
One thing I had to eventually teach myself is that when someone that constantly upsets you, but ""means well"", refuses to change the way they speak to you - it means they don't mean well.
I dont recall my parents ever telling me they miss the depressed teenager I was. They're happy for me.to be who I am now and be happy now and that's how your parents should be as well.

Not a difficult concept but some people struggle with it. You did the right thing telling her to fuck off
As a cis person (sorry if I shouldn't be here or something, but I just wanted to learn more for a friend) I'd find it weird if my mom said that to me. Maybe ""I miss when you were a kid"" because kids always grow up too fast. Or maybe if I used to be a nice kid and now I became a douche she could say that she misses the old, kind me.   
But if I'm still kind then there's no reason to miss the old me who was also kind...   
I don't think telling you that is ""meaning well"". If anything it's guilt tripping you into feeling bad for her, even though your feelings are important too. So even if it hurts I hope you won't ever feel bad about turning her away when she tells you things like that.    
Also, you're genuinely super pretty ❤️ I wish you good luck with everything
Fwiw I'd never talk to her again. Good parents might not get it but will see you happier and try.

But if you do. Start the new conversation, right in the middle of an unrelated old one with: some fucked up shit like you did already maybe ""why can't you act more abused? I miss that you. ""
I know, she does not love me, she hates me and would have aborted me if she knew I was gonna be like this. She doesn’t want me and constantly threatens to kick me out of the house, locking me in a mental hospital or call the cops on me almost daily
We tried getting her help but it didn’t work. She always was against the idea and left one of the meetings 7 minutes in. The meeting was about me and how my parents needed to do to support me in my life. She then wrote about it on her blog saying how proud she was to leave. The best decision she had ever made

Have you seen yourself lately? You are incredibly stunning..🥰
I fourth this statement
I ninth that statement
Oh my that isn't good at all I understand that you feel a need to stay because if what she says bit also you really need to get out if there and lock her out of your life.
Run. Run far. Run fast.
I don’t see how this is pertinent to what my post was originally about.
We actually don't know that. With hormone therapy, the amount of red blood cells is the same as for cis women. Of course trans women are larger on average , but so are cis women that are athletes. Do you want to exclude trans women from basketball because e.g. they are tall, even though cis women in basketball are also tall?

There are many sports where muscle mass is not the deciding factor. Swimming is more endurance based, if the oxygenation is the same with HRT, we would need studies to know if there are still advantages for trans women. 

The fact that we haven't heard from a lot of trans women winning medals shows, it is not that clear cut.

2 years on HRT and finally happy		"You look beautiful honey! I’m glad you’re happy 😊
Could definitely cosplay as Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas.
OMFG YOUR SO BOOTIFUL
You remind me of Felicia Day. 😊
staring at this pic with the biggest heart eyes!
This is kinda random, but you look like my brother’s ex-girlfriend (a compliment, she is super pretty, and so are you)
Ur hair colour is so pretty!
GORGEOUS
Even in the old photo you can see it. Behind masculine traits you can see the eyes, the soul of a woman. Ah, the wonders of human healing. I pray I can go through the same this softly and steadily. x
you look amazing!! 😭
YOURE SO PRETTY?!????? OMFG????
I'm happy for you, girl. You look amazing
OMG QUEEN YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL
And sooooooo pretty!
Wtf how are you so pretty? What is your secret?
Okay one you're just totally gorgeous and two your makeup game is on-point
You deserve to be happy!
jusst, w o w 🤩
You look amazing I’m happy for you :)
you look beautiful! did you have FFS or is there hope that estrogen will fix my busted ass chin
😯😯omg! Pretty!
You’re gorgeous!!
Proud of you beauty
You’re so pretty 🥺
OMG I love leopard print!!!!!
Wow, beautiful!
My god, your makeup is so good and I’m sooo jealous!
I STG I feel like all trans people seem to be gorgeous before and after. But in the after, they’re always more beautiful because they look so happy!
wow you were really hot before hrt, and now you’re even hotter lol
Congrats!
You look stunning. I am glad you are happy.
Holy hotness!
Your stunning before and after! confused bisexual screaming. 😉

In the left pic you look like a young Dave Mustaine, and in the right pi’s you are one of the best passing, most beautiful woman I have ever seen!

Absolutely gorgeous. You look super happy too! ❤️
Look at how cute and happy you look! I am so happy for you.

You look adorable 💖
You’re amazingly gorgeous!! Like WOW!!!!!!!!
You’re very pretty and I don’t regret checking your profile WOW. Girl I’m crushing over here
So femme and fabulous!
Beautiful 🌈 💖
Lovely. I am glad you are happy. Thank you for sharing your journey.

I’m so happy for you:D
you’re so cute!!
Beautiful!
Holy heck, save some beauty for the rest of us! Girl you're radiant.
so you've just always been pretty huh
Wow
You give me kate blanchet vibes
Beautiful!
omgomgomg you look fantastic!!

You look like Sally from the nightmare before Christmas :0

Wow. Gorgeous
How does it feel being the cutest motherfucker alive?
And gorgeous
You should be happy you are beautiful.
You are a beautiful human! Congratulations on living life the way you are meant to!
Damn you're gorgeous!
EEEEE omg you're so cute ❤️ I love your hair colour wish I had hair like that 👉👈
EEEEE you look so cute ❤️ I wish I had hair like yours. It's so pretty ❤️
I love love love your hair.  You look beautiful
You look amazing!!! 😍
Wow, that’s amazing! I love your hair, in both pics☺️
oh you are GLOWING
You look GORGEOUS and honestly this pic should show people that it doesn't matter if your face has 1 or 2 ""masculine"" features. Especially not if the rest is super feminine as yours is. Especially not after 2 years of HRT to sorta soften and glow everything. Like a lot of people here would have probably commented on a different pic that your chin or jaw shape ""clocks you"" but that simply isn't true. You truly look like AFAB to me. A cute one at that.

 What actually gets judged is your total package including face, body, clothing, voice, style, mannerisms, tone, attitude, literally everything gets combined and then the total product is what someone will judge as either ""Male or female"". You have such beautiful hair and eyes and I'm guessing from these pics an amazing body. 

 Congrats on getting there! After being on HRT for only 1 month myself looking as good as you do is pretty much my goal for the next 23 months =)
Awww congratulations you look so beautiful!!
You look amazing
Love this❤️
I am glad you are finally happy.
Wow!! Any FFS? I'm starting hrt in 6 weeks and feeling super excited!!
You look like a cat mom 😸
Yasss! Your eyes are smiling! I noticed the other day that I was finally getting smile lines. I had very intense frown lines most of my life from trying to live in the gender I was born into.
You are cute AF!
awww! you definitely do look happy :)

best wishes xxx
Absolutely gorgeous
you've been always looking superb
You look very beautiful.

Yesterday i got called sir in public and that was my first time passing as a man. now i cant stop seeing a boy when i look in the mirror. im very happy.		"You definitely do pass! There's no doubt in that.

I was literally just sitting with a cis boy on a table who looked almost exactly like you!
Well all I see in that Pic is a boy with a trans flag
You totally pass! I see all boy, no Girl!
Awesome 👍
Congrats dude [◕‿◕✿]
I thought you were my friend Charlie until I saw the flag. And he’s a good looking dude.
are you a trans ally? so cool man!

nice to see cis boys supporting us
you absolutely look like a guy! I'm so happy for you!
AMAB and you honestly remind me of a younger me. Killing it my dude!
boy :)
YOU LITERALLY LOOK LIKE MY TWIN DUDE OMG WE CUTE ASS BOYS
Congrats bro!
Congrats, man!

bro you pass as fuck
Bruit you look like a regular r/teenager user! You pass as fuck
Congrats, man. My first time being called sir in public was also yesterday! Doesn’t it feel great? 😁👏
Being called ""sir"" by a complete stranger feels SO GOOD 

Like ""me, sir. Yes I am sir. Who are you, human, that has seen me as sir?""
What do you mean can't stop seeing a man? It's not like an orange will stop looking like an orange. An orange is an orange, you are you and you are the man you think you are! good luck on your journey, bro!
AAAAA I LOVE IT AAAAA
Ayyyy nice bro
you look identical to my cousin lol
Eyyyyy, I know how great something like that is to hear, had a thing like that a few weeks back when I was in school, they said “hey girllll” or something along those lines and I was so shocked I frgot to speak in a feminine voice (I’m a trans grl and try to speak at a girl’s pitch cuz I much prefer it) and so I replied “heyyy” in my super low voice, their head almost fell off no joke😂😂😂

Edit: sry fr the monologue😆😭
On like my second week of my first job, so early may, a woman passing by asked me ""ma'am, do you have any spare masks?"" And it 100% made my day. Hasnt happened since, but it was still so cool.
That's awesome dude! :D
I was also called sir in public yesterday not as pog
I keep being called young man its top tier gender euphoria. Plus my voice has begun cracking since I got on T which is a bad time for young guys but wow it's exciting for me lol.
Recently happened for me tooooo 🔥🔥🔥
Congrats, that’s awesome, I’m so happy for you!
F\*\*\* yes dude! This made my dayyyyyy!
You 100% read as a boy to me
Nice
First thing I thought when I saw the pic was ""Yay, a cis guy ally. And a cute one at that.""
Congratulations, sir!
Congrats, my dude!
I'm really proud of you man!
You look a lot like a boy I knew when I was a kid.
That’s awesome bro. Onward!
Legit know a cis dude who looks a lot like you.
Please sir, calm down.

(See what I did there)
MASSIVE W!!
Hell yeah! Congrats, man!
Yaye!!! Also got called madam at the hardware store yesterday ☺️! What a feeling right!
Dude nice job, you look like my homie Isaac :)
My man, you’re handsome!
all I see is a handsome man and a cool looking flag
I’m so happy for you, man!! You definitely pass!!
Cool story, bro.
Good for you
💜💜💜💜i love you that is such a beautiful moment. Eventually you get used to it but hopefully pride of being yourself never fades💜💜💜🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Seeing this I assumed you were a trans girl and then I read the title and did a double take. You pass 1000% dude.
You look so handsome!
Awesome! Congrats dude
U look like a 15 yr old Boi
Congratulations! Keep that head high, Wouldn’t want your crown falling, King!
I mean...what else would you see?
Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaahh!
I'm happy for you, bro! I bet that felt amazing
I thought this was my girlfriends brother lol
It does not matter that a grandmother who without glasses could hardly see had told me boy, even in that context I will always keep her affection 👍
you deff pass, but i would have probs called you boy or kid instead of sir
Congrats dude!! That feels so so good
Congratulations
i see it too😇
Congrats bro! I’m so happy for you :)
I know that's feeling! I'm really happy you got to feel good about yourself! :D
The first “sir” is a big deal, and it’s going to be a big deal every time. I was on testosterone a little over a year when I got my first one. Congrats, sir!
Looking handsome sir, so happy for you :)
Nice going bro! You got this!
Was it followed by ""... You're causing a scene""?
I'm literally trying so hard to see girl here and I can't. Your eyes, your hair, your mouth, your hands, it's all very masculine.
That's sweet, dude. I'm happy for you.
 Yay I’m so proud of you!!!
Congrats my good sir!
👍
Legitimately had no idea you used to be a girl until I read the thing
I can't stop seeing a boy when I look at this picture. You look very happy.
Very wholesome! Congrats man!
You kinda look like me (you are a bit more masc) so this makes me very happy too :) I love when people think I’m a dude
unironicially thought you were a cis guy and that i went to the wrong subreddit until i saw the trans flag
would give an award if i could, but im too broke for that
I don’t see how you wouldn’t pass
You are a boy!
Happyyyy!!😃😃😃
U pass very well and I'm not just saying this to be nice
Yoo me too!!!!
That is always fun
fuck yes dude!!
Good for you, young man.
Awwwww good for you. You pass extremely well.
Dude pog
why do u literally look exactly like me
Look at this handsome boy
King energy right here
Can someone explain why this person has a flag on their wall like it's political ideology if it's not a political ideology?
hell yeah man!
Congratulations
u/LucianoTheBeastxx That’s awesome my man! Congratulations!
BAHAHAHAHHA I thought this was my friend Charlie too!

I was playing Minecraft earlier and I'm happy that mojang stand with us :)		"Take that Notch
I remember when Notch said horribly transphobic stuff, and then Lena Raine was hired as a minecraft composer, and then Notch wasn't invited to Minecrafts 10 year anniversary, and now he's probably just lonely and rotting somewhere or smthn

I think its very funny and also nice to look at these sequence of events, and to see a fellow trans composer winning. Incredibly common Minecraft W
I got the same title message a few days ago. Makes me glad the company's with us, even if a lot of Minecraft players aren't
Minecraft knows its audience
I’m losing my mind rn! This is so awesome
Just learned that Notch is super transphobic and into conspiracy theories called ""pizzagate"" and QAnon... General batshittery

So yeah fuck Notch and lets all build a trans pride flag in our Minecraft worlds 🥰
Minecraft? More like Basedcraft.
Been using minecraft for years making pixel art im so glad to see that 🖤
Loveee it!!
Something I didn’t know about until I saw it on a trans sub here (don’t remember which one) is that some of the music in Minecraft was made by a trans woman! She composed the music for two of the discs and maybe some other stuff too, I’m not sure. Her first name is Lena but I don’t remember her last name. So Mojang has also proven that they’ll happily work with trans people too, which I think is also super important. Finding out about this message and about Lena’s involvement was enough to push me to finally get the game.

Edit: Looked it up, Lena Raine is her full name and she actually worked on the soundtrack for Celeste too! I haven’t played Celeste but I think that’s very fitting.
This is so ""bare minimum"" but for some reasons it makes me so happy :D.
🏳️‍⚧️
Thank you Hatsune Miku for creating Minecraft
Anyone for a minecraft server? I dont have friends that play minecraft please someone play with me just few mods and survival chill minecraft
Omg yeesss!!!
Just to hurt Notch that little more lol
There's another splash that reads ""Contains infinite genders!"" =D
based mojang
Is this real!?!? If so then heck yeah!
I saw one that said “protect trans kids” it might have been a mod though as I was playing 1.12.2 MC Eternal modpack
Basedcraft!?!?!
In my opinion we don't have to congrats companies, all of these is pink washing, pink capitalism, sadly...like, biggest capitalists are conservatives (mostly) and just with fake marketing fool people to believe there is an inclusion linked with the product they are selling. And before someone say it, I know, I'm not saying anything new, a pretty trivial thing.
Yay !
Nice!!
That's awesome
Heck yeah! I like Minecraft now
It feels more like a desperate way of making the community like them more after the chat reporting drama. But it is still awesome to see it in the game (unlike the technoblade reference)
Trans rocks ⚧️
I got that message on trans visibility day
I saw this too!! I'm so happy mojang but that in there!
Read a comment on here about Notch being a transphobe. Yeah that’s what happens when you get too far into politics and lean onto left/right wing extremism. 

Sucks to suck Notch lmao. Good for Mojang. Love to see it! ❤️.
I remember one time seeing a video with lady Agnes in it and she was wearing a Minecraft shirt with the progressive pride flag i think) and it made me SOOOO happy. Knowing the history of the creator of Minecraft it makes me so happy to know that the staff seem really accepting.
Thanks for all the love .  I didn't expect this to become number one on Hot Posts in this subreddit !  Means a lot so thank you everyone !  You are all such amazing people !
L Notch
I want to be a crocodile now
Are there genders that aren't valid? God I hate validity
Yeah the creator notch is a ass hole to us folk but Microsoft is who is being decent human beings here
Notch is seething right now
notch seething rn
Im literally crying :’) i needed this today
Yay :D
I'm really happy about that too :)
I can imagine notch starring up the game and the Mojang logo appears and the minecraft music starts to play as it fades in and he reads this.
YAY!!
Is notch transphobic?
Who is that? Hatsune Miku made Minecraft
who’s notch, i only know of hatsune miku, creator of the hit video game minecraft
Minecraft is always the best place to go
Lena has awesome music. And i didnt know she was trans until just recently x.x
> and now he's probably just lonely and rotting somewhere or smthn

uh, well, with piles and piles of money
Lena Raine just fits so well as a composer for Minecraft. Her music fits so well with game’s atmosphere. I remember the first time I heard Aerie I was completely speechless
Is Minecraft’s player base particularly bigoted? I never got that impression but I could absolutely be wrong.
Minecraft is transing our kids!!! /s
It really is!
We need to make a massive trans flag all together
Watch out for traps 😃
Wait my favourite Minecraft song ""Other side"" was composed by a trans person?! 

I am filled with happiness this game is epic

Also did you know you can (kind of) make the Trans flag out of wood thanks to the new cherry blossom wood? It's not out yet but will be soon and it's so epic
I find it so wild when a game like this, with people from all walks of life playing it, makes a statement like that and people are all like ""bArE mINiMuM."" I'd be willing to bet every dime I've ever made that Mojang is getting thousands of hateful messages, death threats, and other bullshit from the transphobes. I commend Mojang for taking the risk to support us in spite of the thousands of transphobes.
Tbf it's more than what a lot of games have done so I'm just happy Minecraft is spreading love:)
In this case i am not sure what more could they do, they went and explicitly said their support and not much could they add for support in the gameplay they haven't already.

Like a narrative focused game could add trans characters but Minecraft you can just be a trans character (plus you can make the trans flag in banners)
🏳️‍⚧️
Sure I can! I play both Java and bedrock so yeee
I have a modded server lol, but probably not your kind of thing since you want a 'chill' server Lol
Yeeee I've seen that one before lol
Yeah that's very true however we can congratulate the people working on Minecraft who have definitely pushed for more acceptance and aknowladgement in the company
Mojang has always been pro trans. Look at how fast they ousted notch
Microsoft did also really push pro-LGBT and accessibility in their games and are typically considered the forerunners when it comes to it.  
also they kept the pride flag on the twitter pfp for months after pride
Minecraft is owned by Microsoft, and they're a pretty progressive company. I hate simping for any major companies, but they actually do quite a bit to support lgbtqia+ and have some pretty awesome benefits when it comes to supporting employees for gender affirming care.
Yes, I get what you all say, but still...I just can't associate any company to that, sorry. Think about Nestle, who supplied and supported the Nazis back in the day. I know that we would ""prefer"" a company who """"""""supports"""""" the community but it's pure pink washing for me. That's what I think. I want to clarify I'm anarchocommunist and have the hate for them doubled too haha. And like, tons of the products we consume are made by companies which owners exploit people, are transphobic, homophobic, racists, not openly, but they surely are. Ofc a company can be owned by, a trans person, for instance, but we know how it works...
Okii 😃
They’re just affirming us. All genders are valid, of course, but Mojang wants us to know that our own is valid even when other people state otherwise.
Yep. And he's pretty much not a great person in general apparently
Notch is just not a great person in general. He's transphobic, claimed that feminism is a ""social disease"", supports the white nationalist slogan ""It's Okay To Be White"", and is a supporter of QAnon.

You shouldn't really be worried, though. Notch hasn't been involved with Minecraft in years.
Wildly
Very. He's also very anti-semetic, which should've been more apparent to us, since villagers are greedy, have big noses, and are PROTECTED BY GOLEMS, which have been viewed as sacred protectors of Jewish people for hundreds of years.
That's the whole reason this got added to minecraft
And a neo-Nazi.
Transphobic, racist, and an overall conspiracy nutter.
Uhhhh well he’s a nazi so
He was uninvited from minecon because of it I believe
he's basically toeing the line to nazi, if he hasn't reached that point. Sold minecraft and then fell down the alt-right pipeline
Oof, it’s sad but yeah, good he ain’t here no more :D
he’s a full tilt lunatic. I don’t even know if he knows what he’s saying, he may have genuine brain issues
Also a q-anon supporter
That's the whole original thing of Hatsune Miku wrote Harry Potter was originally about Minecraft not Harry Potter. It was the idea that Hatsune Miku created Minecraft and that was because just like with JK Rowling the creator of Minecraft turned out to be a not nice person.
and I didn’t know until I saw your comment 🏳️‍⚧️
I didn’t know she was trans until recently and I literally took my name from her
money can't hug you
all the money in the world can’t make people like you—just look at elon musk
I mean some are pretty bad, but the majority I've seen are pretty chill. And the MCYT fanbase, say what you will about the content/general attitudes of people in it, is very VERY LGBTQ-friendly, and a lot of people in it are LGBTQ too. 

And I'm pretty dang involved with Minecraft stuff (involved with content creation).
From my experience, it is. Or it used to be back when I played on servers. But after reading the other person's account, I suppose I'm just a good target for  transphobic people
it's the best selling game of all time. that kinda necessarily includes some shitty people
i mean, it's the best selling game of all time, there's gonna be a sizeable portion of shitheads
I think it's like any platform for internet communities.  It's not a predominantly toxic space like most competitive shooters are, but it's a large internet community and is bound to have its shitty sub-communities as much as its chill ones.
NOOOO! THE GAY BLOCKS ARE MUTILATING THE KIDS AGAIN!!!
I would if i could, but I've no way to multiplayer://
You betcha!!!! Otherside is such a vibe. 

And yes!!! I’m REALLY excited for it to drop. I’ve been building a sort of cottagecore house and filling it with trans flags aesthetics using stained glass and flowers and stuff but I’m SUPER stoked to make another one and build the goddamn WALLS out of trans energy.
Otherside and Pigstep, among others! All composed by Lena Raine, who also worked on the music for Celeste.
I didn't mean it in a bad way. I'm sorry-

Microsoft refused to moderate slurs against us on Xbox for the longest time and cultivated a toxic gaming community that harms us to this day, and has been donating hundreds of thousands to anti queer lawmakers as late as 2020, long after they started claiming to be ""progressive"", they only ""thought to rethink it"" after they were *forced to* by the amount of backlash. No such thing as a progressive company. Actual progress is socialism
I would also like to mention they they have been at the forefront of accessibility of gaming
The concept of queer validity is harmful because it originated and is used as a way to distinguish between the bad queers and the good queers within exclusionist/truscum circles. Transphobes don't think we ""aren't valid"", they think much worse things about us
this genuinely surprises me - damn i thought he was chill
Notch? Who's that guy? The only creator of Minecraft i know about is Philza Minecraft and he's a big ass ally

There's a video ""TheRightOpinion"" just made earlier this week on him. [For anybody interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6CnTzWNyds)
Never before have I been so happy a big corporation bought the rights to something I like.
I'm always worried about the money I put in his pockets since 2012. It's a moral standing to me. 

If he still owned the game I would stop playing it even though it's my all time favorite. 

So I can still play, but knowing who and what we support by what we buy in this capitalist society is very important. 

I know a lot of people don't care what products they buy or who it supports but I do care about those things.

It sucks but I'm glad I now know.
I hate dog whistles; say what you mean
It's pretty depressing a harmless phrase like ""It's okay to be white"" has being taken by these people and made into something hateful
Oh god... Pardon me for a tangential rant.

Sorry, I remember the It's Okay to be White thing. It was a 4chan psyop to try and ""expose the hypocrisy of the media."" And it was so obviously bait that I thought no one would give a shit. And then of course the media actually did what 4chan expected and they all laughed.

But of course, the problem is most people are smart enough to understand nuance. Black Lives Matter doesn't mean other lives don't, it means we as a country have been treating them like they don't and some of us want to change that. So when All Lives Matter gets introduce to oppose the BLM movement, everybody knows you wouldn't oppose the idea that all lives should be equal by saying all lives should be equal. We all know you're trying to say something else.

It's Okay to be White was a racist phrase from the start. Not because it isn't okay to be white, but because in the context of the time and place we're in, the implication is that it isn't okay to be anything else. And while they're laughing at the perceived media hypocrisy, they've actually exposed their own racism because actual racists who didn't know it was a psyop understood the nuance and adopted it.

And the truth is, they're not idiots either. They understood what the phrase was actually saying. That's why the chose it. If they didn't think it was racist, they wouldn't think the media would get upset about it. But they twisted it up with mental gymnastics to explain how this was the leftist media's hypocrisy rather then their own.

Sorry, that whole situation drove me up a wall because at every turn they were exposing how terrible they are while pointing at everyone else and saying ""We exposed your terribleness!"" How are you so dense?
Holy shit.
holy fuck i'm jewish and never made this connection, and i'm not sure how now that i know
Me neither. That’s so cool!

Right, that’s the general vibe I’ve gotten in my 8 or 9 years of playing. I have no doubt there are shitty people who play the game, but I’ve found the average player to be better than that of most other games.
Maybe different sections of the community are worse than others. Especially if the servers involve PvP, worst of all competitive pre-1.9 PvP minigames, I’ve noticed those servers tend to be much more hostile. Not necessarily transphobic (in my experience) but I wouldn’t be at all surprised…

Sorry you’ve had to deal with this, my friend. :(
Shoot well we should all make a big trans flag in our worlds
Yes I can't wait to have absolutely everything a trans flag now lmao

Also her full name is Lena Raine
I'm not gonna argue with you...I took a look at your comment history and Hooo boy you just argue for the sake of arguing.
they're... ran by people though? what's the point you were trying to make? /gen
Wow you are a special type of stupid aren't you
🏳️‍⚧️
Yeah my server is like an intergalactic civilization thing for 1.12.2
Me and my friend started on different planets and we've still basically just started.

However I do have a vanilla server with my friend on the latest version that's just for chilling
Well, I did say ""*pretty*"" progressive. 

Eventually this just boils down to the perpetually-online arguement of ""no ethical consumption under capitalism,"" which is true, but that doesn't mean you have a choice on whether or not to participate in it - we have to consume if we want to survive. Until more is done to remedy the issue, the most ethical option afforded to us is to make conscious choices to support the companies doing the least harm. I'd say that with all its initiatives to support marginalized groups, Microsoft is a company I'm comfortable supporting. But obviously that's just my opinion.

I'm curious about these donations to anti-queer lawmakers. Was it specifically regarding the suppresion of LGBTQIA+ rights? I'd love some sources if you've got them. I'd search myself, but I'm finishing a final paper and am out of ""research energy"" lol.
He used to be, I think something radicalized him around the time he sold the game, now he’s an anti Semitic transphobic reactionist
Same.  I'm not going to lie, I'm sad now.
This and Rowling dropped around the same time and it was a hard period for me. I used to read his dev blog every Thursday and everything
I’m not the only one who thought that Philza was the creator of Minecraft. (I know it’s a joke)
Omg, that really feels weird to say, doesn't it...
Hey, you didn't know then, it's okay

What matters is that he doesn't own it anymore, and no money from the game goes to him anymore
Dam you’d stop playing over some stupid persons opinion people are weird ngl
Well, it seems harmless until you remember that this phrase was birthed from a belief that white people are being ""replaced"" and that the Jews control all media on Earth.
It took me someone explaining it to get it. Even without Notch being a known antisemite and fash adjacent weirdo, it's still really hard to see as a coincidence. It's crazy to me just how common anti-semitic imagery is in media, especially ones that ripped straight from Nazi propaganda posters. The concept of cartoon villains having big noses and rubbing their hands together is almost IDENTICAL to a famouse propaganda poster made by the Nazis.
And today is also where I learn. 😲
Nrjdjdjixieicieid tyyyy I did need one
Everyone wants their hugs.
what are you talking about
Yep, that’s what I’m getting from it!
Me toooo. 

Yeah I just checked! Probably should have looked it up *before* my original comment lol but I got excited.
Wth do u mean intergalactic civilization 🤣
It was pizza gate. No I’m not joking. That was when he started saying crazy things.
It led to the sale. Pretty much Mojang said they wanted the game but not him because of his shit. He made a ton of money, but I'm glad he has nothing to do with it anymore.
Money shows what people really are
As I recall, it was around the time that GamerGate was starting to be publicly discredited and the fervor started to die down, Notch made a tweet saying that he sympathized with the Gaters but never wanted to say anything for fear of backlash.  

From there, the breadth of his shitty political views unfolded.

I'm pretty damn sad that the creator of a generation-defining amazing game is like that, but glad he doesn't hold the reigns to it anymore.
He is cringe now
Oh so he changed, nvm then
Oh come on I thought he was nice... Well
💯
Actually, you are the weird one friend.  It's called honor, integrity and principle and I for one wouldn't want to be a drone for capitalism...we are all in it, but need to navigate it with eyes wide open, if you know what I mean.
What’s this? A bottom? (You guys are super common here smh)
He’s a fucking bigot, so probably some random shit lol. Just scrolled through their profile and they’re transphobic af, like coming into autism subs to call people stupid and generally are just an asshole.
We got galacticraft with like 3 planet packs, warpdrive which let's us build fully functional starships out of blocks, flans mod for guns, and HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod to name a few

Oh and IE+it's expansions, Mekanism, and numerous other assorted mods
pizza gate?
Actually it was a bit earlier than that, he was big into gamergate
no the sale happened before the anti semetic stuff, he sold mojang because the negative attention he was getting as the face of Minecraft, despite no longer being the lead developer was negatively effecting his mental health. He originally tweeted asking for a buyer as a joke, but microsoft made an offer he couldn’t refuse, and his mental health pushed him over the edge.
I would agree. I heard a quote, “Money does not change you but rather allows you to be more of who you truly are.”
Mhm…
It's crazy
It’s a conspiracy theory based off an email of a Clinton worker saying they want to go to a DC pizza parlor. That then was morphed into the idea that the pizza parlor was a cover for a child sex slave ring in the basement. The pizza place had no basement and eventually a believer in the conspiracy shot up the place.
Also, most humans in general don’t handle sudden wealth well. Last I heard (and this was a long time ago) Notch is basically wasting away in his LA mansion
Oh my bad, I remembered it incorrectly.
Resources
Oh also I wanna try this for science! *pats head*
holy shit people are stupid wtf
Sounds nice... Better than wasting away in my little apartment right?
nah you’re good, I get passionate about stupid stuff that doesn’t matter 😅😅
Hejcjejcjekcjejcjejfjeicjejf… also science is cool
Correct. This was proto qanon and was a warning of what was to come. Nobody learned from it unfortunately.
Yes, but you probably aren't wasting away. You are still thinking and interacting with people. Wealth inhibits that.
Yee it’s one of my favorite things
This is wild.
The dude could commission a life sized Battletech mech to be built, and he could pilot it across a plot of land that he has decorated like a futuristic warzone. Or he could ride in a custom made hot air balloon across all 7 continents. Or he could have a massive heated pool built so that he can swim without ever getting cold.

Instead sits at home, presumably browsing /pol/ all day.
Literally just applying to jobs and making coffee...
But yeah?
Same!!!!!
Rich people just don't know how to have fun.
Good job👍
Ooo! What field? For me I’m a bio and paleo girl
I’m still in hs so idk yet
Good luck to both of you!
Bruh, that’s not an excuse. Freshman me from two years ago knew what she wanted to do
Oh ig what I’m doing for an actual job I’m a comp sci girl. If I had to choose my favorite science field prob physics even if I’m not the best at it"	12cl3rx	trans	5511	0.96	2023-04-05 13:52:45
Hello! I recently joined Miss Trans Global Philippines! Here’s my National Costume inspired by “Babaylan” or a Filipina transgender Goddess / High Priestess to remind our community’s place in the society #HappyPride 🌈 🏳️‍⚧️		"Yesssss ! 👌🏻👏🏻 gorgeous!!

This made me go ""holy shit"" out loud because of how impressively good it looks on you

I'm jealous of how it looks, but not from the same culture so I shouldn't replicate it. You rock the look though!!
Stunning!
😍😍😍😍
You absolutely do look like a trans goddess... 😍 -Supriya, intern at LemmeBe
Superbe Good luck

You look like a fucking goddess
G o r geous 😍😍😍💜
Be a woman! 🏳️‍🌈✨
Omg thank you! 😅
This means a lot! 🥰
Aww thank you!!
Ooh heellooo
Aww thank you 😭
Hi sis!! I’m so glad you came across my post! I will always fight for our visibility!! 🌈 🇵🇭 🏳️‍⚧️
Yay!!! 🌈
Thank you! I made the costume myself! I represent the province where this kind of traditional beadwork is taught in every school! 😄
Aww thank youuu!! 😍🤟🏽
It’s not in the best condition but if you want it I’ll send it to you! 😄
Trans and Asian! Perfect combination 😌😌 🌈
Woooow! Thank you! 🌈
I’m sure you are too! 😍🥰
I’m actually part of a tribal community that revered Babaylans! It’s in my blood!
I might be wrong but I think that shows up as a placeholder if someone uses a flag emoji that doesn't exist on Reddit or possibly even on your phone.
It’s the flag of trans community. Baby blue represents traditional color for boys, and pink for girls. White is for the folks in transition.
Hugs!! 🥺😢 You’re so nice I appreciate it!!
🥰
Thank you! 😍
Awwww lovee I’m blushing 😊
Thank you!!
😍🥰
Thank youuu!! Means a lot 😭
Thank you!!! 🥺
It is not that heavy hehehe 😄
Ooh thank you!
Babaylan is one of my faves , you served it baby !!!
I'm half Filipino aswell hehe :)
agree 200% 🙌🏽
Thats so great to hear! I am also from a tribal community but in Canada. I love seeing our cultures embrace our own ideas of gender. 

I saw from the other comments you made your own regalia too. That's so amazing you are very talented! 

Also you are so finnnnnnne in these pictures. Keep on shining bright and thanks for sharing!
Oh yeah this, I thought he was referring to the blue and pink trans flag
Yeah, basically the trans flag is a combination of the white flag unicode symbol and the trans unicode symbol, so if it isn't supported your computer/phone will just show those two next to each other.
huh strange it shows up as just white for me. Other emojis that I can’t see show up as a question mark in a box
you look gorgeous btw
Wooow awesomee hey there!!
Hey urself :)
Filipina transfem from Mindanao here! You are amazing!

Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry.
Nice boots! You absolutely radiate power!! I gotta get a bow and start doing archery again…
You also have joint hyper mobility in your elbows(commonly called double jointed).  Me too!  :)
Bad ass.
(disappointingly) not an archer here—can you explain what and why is on your hand? i know the one on the left wrist is to protect your arm from the bowstring but

also i dont think one picture has ever told me ""that's a sapphic"" more than this one just sayin'
*lesbian noises*

Also happy birthday!! Hope you're doing well and that you're celebrating with those close to you! :D
Are you the secret love child of Black Widow and Hawkeye?
[removed]
You look like you could pile drive me and you are *welcome* to 🥵
Omg I love archery! Shooting a bow is harder than one would think. Mostly takes a little bit of arm strength, intuition and good aim
YAAAA
Teach. Me.


Please.
Happy birthday trans and thriving!
Do you want anything?

(Also, you have to tell me where to get those pants, they’re wonderful!)
Happy birthday!

Omg my gf and I (both trans) shoot too! We've been thinking about starting a trans archery club but we're the only 2 we know in Toronto!
I used to do it when I was younger, our town had a rec program. I haven't shot in years though, been thinking of getting a cheap compound to get back in
I'm getting into it's primitive sibling sport, slinging.😂
I used to love longbows until I got my hands on a few recurves and I’ve been hooked every since
You’re welcome I hope it was the bestttt! 💜
You are very welcome...
Ah oke wel i did do it once i was decent in it might buy a bow one day
Reminds me of a time a few years ago one of my older cousins went to a party as the DC comics archer guy Green Arrow or something he was surprised that he got his bow through UK customs because our laws on that sort of stuff is really strict but bows are actually legal here and technically in England it's actually the law for all men aged 14+ to own one and to do at least 2 hours of practice a day also in Yorkshire it's technically legal to kill a Scotsman if he happens to be wearing a kilt and holding a claymore
you’re welcome mrs gorl
I’m not worthy 🥺🥺🥺
YEAAA
Boutta get a bow but hrt got postponed :-|
Thanks, I’ve been trying to up my compliment game lately😁🥰
How do you even get started in a hobby like that?
Seriously tho 🥺 a fellow trans tomboy (can I call you that?) is great to see
Youre very welcome  =)  how old did you turn?
Nah, it's my shoulder, to many dislocations
Not just the bow, I love your hair too
That’s cool been wanting to get back into archery since shooting isn’t viable but got no space for it
I know that your just saying that to be nice as I lack all forms of cool but thank you 1 for being kind and 2 for being so cool and inspiring and yeah
Well then congratulations, you’ve achieved it and are absolutely rocking it! <3
Happy birthday! You are absolute fucking goals.
Yep, it's really useful, actually.  I can reach things in hard to get places when my clumsy self drops them.  Lol.
oh duh ok lol
🏹 🕷️ ❤️=U
😳😳😳
What a shame, I want a pair!
Yw!
Hell yeah!! Happy (belated) birthday!
💘
Honestly you should be in an action movie
NO PROBLEM YOURE AMAZING!!!!!! 💜🔥🔥🔥
☺️
You are welcome. You look like you were having an amazing time and I've got to say I love your hair and if mine fills in on top I want to do something similar.
Nice I’m glad you were so Quick with the answear Edit: That sounded like I was mad about it anyways I’m happy you answered
I’m happy and healthy in the life and body I want! I’m ok!
Trans people know they are trans and are born like this it isn’t caused by childhood trauma. 

We are happier after transitioning thank you very much. 

We can be who we really are. 

She doesn’t need “help”
That sounds like the coolest thing I have EVER HEARD!!
Maybe start a trans archery sub.
I'm trans and *within an hour or two of* Toronto and want to do archery again, haven't been able to since elementary school field trips, haha... sooo if there were a club, well... :)
Trans Archer is honestly a lovely combo of words and im so glad its a real thing.
I'm trans and maybe moving to Toronto and have always been interested in Archery!
Honest question... How does one go about getting into archery? I finally have money, and free time to do hobbies I never got to when I was younger.
I'm a Cis male and I wish someone would start a trans archery club near me. Hell I wish anyone would start an archery club near me 🥲 I just want to learn how to shoot a bow with cool people. I wish you luck on your endeavor!
You should! It’s a good hobby to have!!
They honestly are my fave tbh
So far it is!!
You should! Also most ranges have bows you can rent for cheap if you just wanna try it out before spending a lot of money
Woah!! Really!?!?!
You are MORE than worthy!
It’s ok! It will happen for you!
Honestly I started when I was in jr high and just got a bow from cabela’s and started shooting in my basement, now that I’m in an apartment I go to a local range, most ranges will let you rent a bow tho!
Of course! And thank you!!
I am 26!!
Oh no! I’m so sorry! You could rock a crossbow!
I go to a local range when it’s not too busy
I’m honestly just a big ol nerd so I think everyone is cool
Thank you 🥺❤️
That’s so dope!! 🔥🤘🏻
Thank you!!
I wish! That would be a dream!
Thank you! And yeah! I’m always changing my hair! So I’m excited for you!
r/transarchery now exists
Oh interesting. Will dm you!
Hmu if you do!
We're lucky here in Toronto that there's a public range. You'd have to look up your local ranges and maybe get a couple introductory classes. From there, buy a bow (Samick sage is an excellent entry level bow), watch some form videos (Jake Kaminski has a decent series), and practice! If you live somewhere you can safely set up a target butt inside or in your backyard for short range practice, that can be a great way to get started.
Ah i see wel i rather buy one maybe i can cosplay with it
It's some of those old laws that were never taken off the books so they're technically still laws but they just aren't enforced
Both got postponed :-|
Now I feel old, I had a feeling I shouldntve asked  =p  But we do crazy things when (\*insert corny comment about how you shot an arrow through my heart with your beauty here  =X  \*)
From what I seen there isn’t a range anywhere near me
I'm a self classified nerd too but unlike you who looks awesome and is so incredibly nice and honestly is just one of the coolest looking and seeming humans I've had the pleasure of seeing I am not/don't, well I try to be nice but I honestly just seem to screw that up too but hey thats most things in my life / that are around me / that interact with me so ye..
Also where did you get that finger guard? I need to get me one
Awesome sauce! Thank you for the info!
Yeah! Go for it!!
Aww I’m sorry about that!!
I got mine off Amazon
Yes i wil of course im gonna cosplay green arrow

My 103 year old great grandma corrected my transphobic cousin on my pronouns!!	"My great grandma (I call her baba) referred to me using they/them pronouns and when my cousin said ""you mean she"" baba just replied ""no, I meant they"". My cousin was a bit unnerved because she is 103 and accepted me so easily. Words cannot say how happy I am.

Update: Sadly baba passed away about a week ago and I'm not on speaking terms with my extended family."	"Transphob: bUt ThEy/ThEm Is CoNfUsInG fOr *OLD PEOPLE*

In this house we love baba
Wish I had a Baba in my life 💜💜💜
When you get to that age you just give zero shits about what society thinks and just love your family. Well at least I think so. What a badass.
Based grandma 💜✌🏼😊
Oh, I was feeling a tad empty and this just filled me back up!
We love you baba
Because age is no excuse I hate people who say oh you can't expect grandma to respect your pronouns she's from a different time my 85 year old grandfather has a trans son and he fully accepted him from the start
I’ll always remember my conservative, kinda racist grandpa using my name and pronouns years before my own parents did.  He even sat down and had a heart to heart with me about how he didn’t feel that they were treating me well through this.  Sadly he’s no longer with us but those words from the least expected source really stuck with me and made an impact in my life bigger than he knew.
If someone born 100 years ago can do it what’s everyone else’s excuse
My heart! It's so warmed! She really is great!
I love baba, give them a hug for me <3
please hug your baba from all of us. family like that seems to be a rarity in the community and i know i would(ve) love(d) someone like that <3
Omg yay! My 103 grandma (oma) also gets my they/them pronouns right! We absolutely stan
wow that's just amazing. you have the best grandma.
Please tell Baba that this internet stranger hopes to be as amazing as she is some day!
That's cuz Grandma's know, Grandma's are incredible. At least mine was and she lived to 103 and I miss her dearly... If you have a connection with your grandma your great grandma and it's a good one they'll always be there by your side, forever even when they're gone to leave little signs that they're still around watching over, some people might not believe this for me I do and I'm so glad and so happy for you that your grandma gets it she's an incredible woman and you're an incredible person.
Huggz Becky 🇨🇦
Yes!!!!!
Saving this and showing it to anyone who comes out with “they’re a product of their time”
My Baba is 82 and says her generation doesn't understand this stuff 😥
Baba is queen, we stan an ally
This reminds me of my brother's ex's grandmother.

(For the sake of the story we'll call my brother B and his ex E)

E's grandmother sees me immediately has her arms out to hug me and says, ""you must be one of B's brothers!"" (I'm a demi-boy and use both terms brother and sibling)

E's parents ""correct"" her saying ""sister"". I immediately say ""sibling"" as I don't want to be misgendered and I didn't want to say brother after they just ""corrected"" that.

E's grandmother without hesitation goes, ""Sibling!"" And hugs me. E might have been a mess and her parents might have misgendered me a lot but her grandmother was *chefs kisses*
that's awesome!!!!! your great grandma is based
Grandma probably would have slapped the shit iut of your cousin if her hand qouldnt fall off. You should get her a sword
**When Babushka has had enough of the cousin's shit**
Based grandma lmao
Grandma giving quite the W vibes
My great grandma was very similar. I came out to her via letter. As soon as she'd read it she called me and said how it must have been so difficult to tell her and that she accepted me. She got to 108 years old before she passed. I've had way more crap from people in their 40-50s than with actually old people.
A saint
Based!
What a legend.
Times are changing.  My family is doing our best to remember to use ""he/him"" for my sister's offspring.  I even got him a necklace from Spencer's that says ""He/Him"" and he loved it.
your great grandma sounds amazing
Damn.... I wish my siblings will accept me since one is 5 and the other is 9
Baba deserves every bit of respect
Based baba
Yea..it’s only really boomers that have an issue with us, silent gen couldn’t care less. You gotta love em
AWWWW THAT IS SO SWEET!
Protect Grandma at all costs
Old people are either the best or the worst, there's no in between, you won the lottery
Based baba (give her a hug from me pls)
Jesus, I cry for the littlest things. This is so sweet and gives me hope for the world. Go grandma!
My grandma is the same way and 🥲 happy crying
great example on why age is not an excuse to be a bigot
She sounds like a wonderful woman ❤️
Best grandma. My parents tried for a second and gave up. My dad texting me ""hey they"" was hilarious though.
Hi OP, thank you for posting this as this warms my heart! Both of my Babas (grandmas) on my mom and dad’s side recently learned that I identify as a trans girl and my pronouns are she/her and they accept me, love me, and want me to be happy and proud who I am. Sometimes the older generations can be more tolerable than our parents. They been on this Earth for longer you are their baby’s baby (or in OPs case add a baby lol) after all. 

Lets not mention how inherently toxic Eastern European culture can be towards us, so its powerful to see them choose love ❤️
For my final paper for my bachelor's degree I focused on the pride celebrations, from the original protest in Stonewall to protests, marches and parades all over the world now.  When watching footage from the late seventies pride marches (in response to the save the children crap that was being pushed at the time) I was actually happy to see how many people actually told the interviewer that they were there to support everyone.  My favorite interview was an old grandmother there with white hair and she told the interviewer that parents should love their children for all that they are and that she did not understand how a mother could turn her child away.  There were tons of families and relatives and friends all there to help everyone LGBTQ+ show pride.

The one mistake so many old people make is they stop learning new things. I'm glad baba hasn't fallen into that trap! Tell her people on the internet are proud of her!
Based baba
A friend's grandma interrupted a transphobic discussion at last Christmas eve, remembering some friends' daughter and said : "" I don't know, maybe she has become a man now cause she sure felt like one"" She was so casual about it that it shut the idiots mouths. This was old news to her, that some people were transgender. Old people can be far more progressive than their entitled boomer kids.
Grandmas are just 🤌🏻
baba is the most epic grandma
your great grandma is a gem
Blessed be baba!! This made me smile.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ok your baba babushka is amazing
Based baba based baba
Astounding. That sounds so validating. I hope baba is well, she is quite old.
W Baba
I keep getting told that old people wont ""get me"" and my grandma can't know because it'd ""kill her""... yet, all the older people I've met, in their 70s, 80s and 90s (I'm a caregiver) have had no issue gendering me correctly and just plain ol' accepting me and them finding out didn't kill any of 'em.
It's so cool to see the older gen accepting us. It's admirable because they were raised differently from us in a conforming society. It amazes me how she slid with it so easily. I was struggling with internalized transphobia for years and I've finally overcome it.
congrats pal :)
The greatest grandma

Grandma has accended beyond mortal worries. She shall accept all for who or what they are.
Damn, she old af. Also fuckin nice

So happy for you and your baba!
Your great grandma is peeeeak, no one has an excuse to misgender anymore. If your centennial grandma can show basic respect for pronouns then everyone can
I'm glad your Baba kept up with the times. Especially since she was born right after/during WW1

I may be stupid but, what's baba?
100 years.

How insane is that.

She has seen so much.
Baba deserves a zweihander.
Yeah it’s funny to see how easy it is for elderly people to understand that pronouns are vital to someone’s being, when slugs like you still don’t see it yourself.
Why are you here man
I can’t tell whether you’re transphobic or not. But if you are. Please find a different subreddit. You have a choice to not cause trouble

Judging by your other content. You might be. But I shouldn’t make that generalization
""I just call THEM"" dude... you played yourself.
“Funny… I just call **them** “it”.

****them****
Evidently you do not
Yup.  My Granpa is in his 90s and extremely religious, and even he gets most of it and accommodates my needs accordingly.

Turns out, if your family truly loves you, they will respect who you say you are.

Same with my great grandmother. It's just I was about 5 and don't remember her. She also died of cancer, damn that fucking disease. The sad thing is, I only met her when she was just 25 hours away from passing. At least she's not in pain. My great grandfather had died sooner also from cancer.
Rest in peace ❤️
Effen A right! TBH it took me almost 30 years to adopt that mindset but, it was worth the wait. Eff judgmental dbags.
It's what they call their great grandma
What is this, ‘respect’ from family
Respect? From family? Preposterous, that can't be something that exists. /s
Turns out if your family loves them, they will respect who them say them are

It took 38 years for me to figure out when you don't care what people think it becomes increasingly easy to be truly happy.  All of a sudden, many cares in life fade away. I'm not saying if you have money issues, they suddenly will disappear.  But it does mean that you are free to do what you want and not what anyone else says you should do.
22 years so far of setting no boundaries really so I feel you! Really trying to get on that dgaf imma be me and f everyone else vibe.

I think living in Texas has taken a huge toll on my mental health. What states do you girls feel safe and happy living in?		"Although we appreciate the in depth conversations this post his led to, it should also be noted r/trans is a space for everyone regardless of ones gender identity. 

Trans men or non-binary people face very similar struggles trans women do, in the future we will act stronger on post titles containing (unnecessary) gendered language so everyone is included in the conversation.

For now we will keep this post up because of the conversations going on underneath it, but please try to remain inclusive!
Oregon isn't terrible. Just stay on the left side of the mountains. The right side is just Idaho Jr.
I’m in Ct. It’s super cold but I’ve never felt unsafe ❤️
State of constant high
Not a day goes by that I don't feel grateful to be living in California. My family lives in Texas and although they are supportive, I refuse to visit them at least until Abbott is no longer in office. I'm so sorry you're living there and I don't blame you at all for struggling mentally. 🖤
Get yourself on I-35, head north, and don't stop until you get to Minnesota unless you need gas or snacks.
Parts of Michigan are very good.  Rural areas can be as shit as Texas, but we have entire cities like Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and Ferndale have tons of lgbt folks, including in the city governments (iirc, Ann Arbor had rhr first gay mayor in the country, in the 1970s).  Very safe.  I went shopping in Anm Arbor dressing femme, was mostly correctly gendered, ran into some queer friends, met another transwoman who was really nice.  And no one looked at me twice because well, there are a lot of lgbt people in thst city.
Eh? Well now, I'm not from the US of A, but instead from O Canada. Aye, it's nice here, but also very, very cold during the winters. But I do not feel unsafe, but that might change once I am more social and leave home more often.
I live in Western Massachusetts and love it. I moved from a pretty bougie part of Brooklyn NY and find I feel safer and more accepted here. People truly don’t give a shit. Health care access has been good. Housing is expensive but not on the level of a major city.
I can't speak to how it feels for the trans fem experience, but as a trans guy 

Olympia, wa
Pittsburgh, pa 
Oakland, ca 

Were all places I've lived that are trans friendly. 
Granted everywhere is rough these days BUT texas is the worst. 
I was arrested after (because) my friend was gay bashed. After that I left and never came back. 
I believe you are badass enough to get the fuck out
WA,OR, weirdly (specifically) Tucson, AZ
Oregon is the best state for free gender affirming care 🌈✌️🙂 plus legal cheap weed and we recently got mushrooms
Holy shit you are stunning.

I'm in England so sorry to say I can't really help with your question tho. Unless you wanna move to Brighton. Pride capital of Europe.
Washington State is absolutely fantastic. I would go so far as to say it's even better than most places in Europe for trans people. We have informed consent laws, and it's illegal for any insurance company to deny coverage of ANY gender affirming treatment as long as it's got a green light from your doctor. This includes things like seeing a voice pathologist for voice training, HRT, any surgeries, laser hair removal/electrolysis, and even hair reconstruction. Not to mention it's an incredibly blue state for the most part. The majority of people in the western half are very accepting. Just stay on the western side of the mountains. Bonus, there's a lot of trans peeps here already! 😊
I'm AFAB, not a lady, but I feel safe in PA, just depends on the area you go to. Basically anything except the outside of the Temple University campus, parts of Philly, and the entirety of what we affectionately call 'Pennsyltucky' feel pretty safe for me lol

Honestly if you ever need to move, I always recommend New Hope. It's pricey but it's like Gay Central for us. If not there than Doylestown is rather pleasant and small, close to some cool spots.
Canada
WA is pretty good so long as you stay on the west side of the mountains.
Well not France, especially country side. Getting worst every year

I’m in Texas but I live in the San Antonio- austin area. There’s actually really good healthcare here, it’s just the rest of texas that’s the “dark zone”
Pennsylvania, it’s pretty safe where i live
Mostly the state of denial. But seriously, things tend to be pretty good in Australia if you want to change country... We do have the typical arseholes who just want to make life harder for us (they're everywhere in the world unfortunately), but the majority of people are pretty good.

Honestly the only times I feel unsafe are times any other woman feels unsafe, rather than it being because I'm trans.
I want to move to New York.
Massachusetts has been pretty good to me so far
Come to Canada (Ontario/Toronto specifically) 😁 you're welcome here. Those nails are something else, you could kill something with those I think!
Minneapolis Minnesota.  The Twin Cities is a great place to live (except the weather in the winter). I love the 🏳️‍🌈 here!  Even in the burbs it’s a good place to live, accepting and amazing.
Another vote for western Washington state. I live about 30 minutes north of Seattle. I almost never get misgendered and have great health insurance which covers large aspects of transition.
I live in Washington state and I've felt mostly safe west of the cascades
Colorado. Obviously there was the recent national news highlighting how dangerous Colorado Springs can be, but in the Boulder/Denver area I have never felt unsafe, even with a public-facing job where I work with children.
you’re gorgeous first off, second, pa is fine just boring as hell, cali is the most accepting but most expensive, id say maybe, vermont wouldnt be bad but again boring <3
Not all of us are girls, but this trans man recommends Illinois
I feel your struggle. I, too, reside in Texas.
minnesota is really good
currently living in Chicago. generally safe during the day time and most places are accepting
I want out of Texas! It’s a soul sucking devil. Parts are cool but tired of it and don’t wanna die here 🤷🏻‍♀️
Washington state and Seattle are extremely friendly towards queer people and we have a bunch of protective laws. Also our governor signed a bill that makes it required for ALL trans care to be covered under any insurance
Not everyone here are girls.  

Massachussets is relatively okay
Not Texas. I used to live in a state of denial.
Minnesota!!!
Oddly enough, PA. I feel safer in the rural areas than suburban PA
PA isn't too terrible,so long as you avoid the red ""pennsyltucky"" parts.
I initially came out in North Dakota back in 2017. Fargo was my hometown. I didn't feel super safe in any Midwestern small town but Fargo was at least large enough - and liberal enough - to keep me safe.  


I eventually ended up moving to Seattle, WA in 2020. Then to Bremerton, WA in 2021.   


I feel safe in that my rights are secure but never totally safe from the threat of fascism and fascists in general.  


Nowhere is truly safe now imho.
Oregon is pretty good, my whole transition is covered and many groups that support us.
We've lived all over the east coast. Never felt safe down south but Maryland, Vermont, and Rhode Island have treated my family and I really well.
Im in Chicago Illinois
It's comfy and people accept the queer community a lot here
Minneapolis here. Not only could I never move to Texas, I won't even visit there anymore!
I’m in Florida. I totally feel ya. Let’s run away and make a coven
NY!
hey this isn't r/mtf maybe don't put ""you girls"" in your posts - very dysphoria inducing for us non girls.
Connecticut is pretty good.  Expensive to live here though.  Pretty much any blue state would be better than Texas.
On a personal level, i feel fairly safe in Kansas, but our government is, at best, apathetic toward trans people. Better than Texas but there's definitely places where the government at least tries to make you safer
I live in Maine. Maine is incredibly safe, and borders Canada should my partner and I ever need to gtfo for any reason.
Washington state
State College PA. and Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. Also, San Diego California seems to be quite accepting during my visits. 
Also, I’m sorry you are having a tough time. Know that your value is intrinsic, and you are loved here 😊
I’m in Michigan.  It’s not totally safe, but we have an all Democrat government right now, and there are definitely safe areas.  And with our petition driven ballot measures, I don’t feel like I’m going to end up in a situation where there are no options here.
I’m in Texas to! DFW area.
Oregon
Pacific Northwest has always been great for me, I’ve also heard good things about most of the northeast
Canada... not a state, but it's safer. The health care system of the Yukon Territories in Canada pays for several gender affirmation procedures.
I was born and raised in WA, so I can't compare my experiences with other states. However, I had a friend who moved from Kentucky to Colorado to WA.

Disclosure: They are a black non-binary person, but we're IDing as a trans woman until 5+ years after moving here. Obviously, rates of violence are higher in their demographic. 

In Kentucky, they worked as a chef in a diner, and had been there presenting as male for 10ish years. They got fired shortly after coming out, albeit with some excuse it was actually because of being trans. 

In their one year being out and living there, they were physically assaulted 12 times, which averaged to about once a month. 

They moved to Colorado after a trans woman friend offered to help, but they were paying $400-600, ridiculous amounts of cash, every month just to keep on HRT. The friend screwing them over didn't help, they only stayed a few months.

After moving to WA, they have lived here since idk 2015, and had one instance of violence early on, one instance of car being vandalized in retaliation from public education work on trans issues, but nothing since then for years. 

Hormones for trans women/trans femmes are completely free in WA, because we have a law that insurance companies must pay for birth control (and that's the same meds for HRT.) 

Testosterone is unfortunately not free, it's a controlled substance on I think the federal level? But it's much cheaper if you go shots instead of cream or implant. 

Our Human Rights Commission is very awesome. Back in 2016 when conservatives were trying to ban trans folks from using public restrooms they really showed up. I have spoken to them in person and have good trust in them.

Overall, I think there are very few places as trans positive, but of course it is best in cities vs rural areas. 

I will say the Seattle Freeze seems pretty bad, everyone I know who transplanted struggled with it. 

California is also good, I hear, and they have more of a social scene vs small exclusive friend groups that are hard to get in. But they also have a lot higher adherence to beauty standards, especially near LA due to the film industry. 

That's about all off the top of my head, hope you find a good place to settle down.
NY was pretty friendly compared to the south. You could pretty much count on people never confronting you in public....the downside is that I got like almost no peace of mind in private. And the weather is super rough, winter is like 8 months.

I just moved to NC and here I get peace of mind but I have to worry about being confronted. So I'm still feeling out the change, I lived here in 2009-2015 closeted and had a great time. But this time I'm not closeted. And this time being trans is a big deal publicly. 


Any which way, I'm working fast food in NC, getting misgendered a ton but I feel like people can tell I'm truscum and they're holding off on me. Like they don't wanna hurl their worst insults cuz I'm pretty.

But yeah I feel for you. It's kinda sad when people are grinding their 'tough love' stones together when they should be showing compassion. I swear, it's one sad commonality between north and south, it's that people have kind of gone too far with 'tough love' and they treat it like a cure all....the thing is, it's not tough love for someone they care about, it's straight self pride and ABSOLUTE need to dominate everyone and everything....which is one shitty way to try to push masculinity on the unwilling....cuz honestly I'd rather do my nails than push apartheid in hopes that I'll get another hit of spiritual crack.
I just moved from Texas to Washington. Feel very safe here in the twin cities. Got an x for my gender on the DL
 Hey genuine thing, please don’t say ‘you girls’ not everyone on this subreddit is a girl. Transmen exist in trans spaces too. For future reference. 

Also CA and Kaiser covered my top surgery (I’m a minor)
You shouldn’t say “you girls” on a general trans sub
Not a girl. Ohio is fine enough. Don't lump up all trans people into ""girls"".
Not a state but the Netherlands is pretty alright
DC area on the MD side has been good to me.
Try New Jersey
Ireland pretty good
Akron Ohio has a lot of help for trans people and ive never felt directly threatened here. People stare sometimes guys mostly but I lived in Texas its better than there.
What the hell, the fact that texans can even clock you is weird to me. You're passing better than most.
MA
NOT southern Indiana!
I'm in the Dallas area so I feel your pain. Not to bad up here but still get it from time to time.
I'm from a more conservative part of Colorado but bigger citys like Denver are very welcoming.
New York! also, you are like crazy gorgeous!! 😍

From personal experience - California and Illinois
Illinois
Massachusetts is pretty ok, just stay in the cities and urban areas
Buffalo, NY.
Honestly, I moved to Kent, Ohio. Bought a house and the community is so accepting. Small town, college town. Close to a big NE city (because they’re all cooler than anything across the Mississippi). Check it out. Amazing college, cool people. Also, I’m not in college, I’m trans, and loving it. So yeah. Much love to you baby. Don’t let the state take you down, take the state down.
Guy here, but I'm in NY. It seems pretty good here.

Also you're so pretty 😭♥️
Recommendations because I've lived many places:    
1. Seattle: best trans protection in the country, housing/rent prices are similar to Dallas and no income tax, massive gay community, easy to access healthcare, the infrastructure and regulations will actually SAVE you money on living costs. Winter is bad, but mild enough to go outside, lots of outdoor stuff and a fun art scene, cafe scene and lots of goths/nerds. Good if you work in tech or want to.   
2. Chicago: low income tax, fun city, good protections, people are super nice! Similar to seattle, but the infrastructure isn't as quality. Well established gay community, not as big as Seattle's though. Biggest con is that winter is horrible, do not underestimate how often winter will keep you inside. Good if you work in healthcare or finance and/or want to. Surprisingly good art scene, really love it!  
3. California (SF, LA, OC and SD): I'm a CA native so I have a bias. But heads up: CA is way more red than people realize and you can get really nasty, dangerous harassment. It's not as safe (in my experience) as seattle or even chicago. THAT SAID: Still way safer than texas (especially Dallas or Houston). Lots to do, massive gay scene, lots of opportunity. Cost of living is insane though and income tax can tax you into poverty if your income isn't high enough. But, there are enough public programs that you can manage if shit hits the fan. Not great if you don't have a safety net though. Great for entertainment, finance, academics and healthcare. People are highly social and highly friendly, there are always things to do. LA Infrastructure is not great, you WILL need a car if you go LA or OC. For SD and SF, you can actually manage okay without a car, walkability and public transpo is pretty good.    
4. Denver or Boulder: I've had great experiences in both of these cities and really loved them. Cost of living was easy to manage, wages seemed to keep up, young population means it was pretty progressive even on the conservative end. City of Denver is small, but easily walkable in Downtown and really fun to be in. Not much nightlife, not a huge gay scene. Club Q and Tracks are the biggest clubs there, but even if it's small it's welcoming and close knit, you'll make good friends there! Also great if you love outdoors. Not too much else happening in Denver, peaceful and sleepy place. Great for energy, geology, weed and transpo industry.   
I'm also in Texas!   
the toll this has taken on my mental health is horrible. I have no energy for anything but work, afraid to go outside, the depression is real. What's even worse are all the people around me saying how it isn't that bad and I shouldn't be afraid...like...bro, we have a gay militia that formed to protect us from the other one that keeps coming to our family events and hospitals...my endo gets threats...there are protestors where I live regularly hanging signs about how I should be dead, IDK...it's hard and the gaslighting is harder.
NJ, but stick to East Jersry cuz West Jersey is basically Rural PA prt 2. Also be careful at night
I'm up in Alaska. It's a red state, but like, a weird red that once in a while pivots into independent/purple territory.

Downsides: There's exactly 1 informed consent clinic within 300 miles of me. Cost of living is high and there's not always a lot to do unless you're really into very outdoor activities. No public transport, so you need to own a car or have a much more difficult time doing anything.  
Upsides: The general mindset seems to be ""Do whatever, just don't bother me"" so even though I'm in the reddest part of the state, no one has outright confronted me or said anything mean to my face for being openly trans, and I'm not misgendered terribly often. At most, sometimes someone will give me a nasty glare. Also I've found a nice little community of supportive friends.
You look so gorgeous ❤️
Not in the states but if you can, come to Toronto. You’ll be safer here than states.
San Francisco, Toronto, and Calgary have been good to me
Not in the United States I plan on getting a passport…
Southern California has been a blessing for me. Moved from Maryland and couldn’t be happier in this state. Feel quite safe being myself here
Illinois has a lot of places that are progressive / safe for queer folks. 

We’ve also got protections for LGBTQ and POC in our state constitution.  

With that said, there is a sea of red conservatism with islands of blue progressiveness south if I-80 so be mindful, and look for places that have secondary education (colleges / universities)..

Wisconsin is similar, but Madison is an amazing town and very progressive.
Ontario

lol
Why can't people understand who we are, why we feel the way we do. Sure I'm fucked up, I don't meet your cisgender expectations but I'm still a person. I've always felt this way - why is it so hard to understand? I do not want to hurt you. I have no secret agenda. Please just accept me my tired heart, my battered mind - I didn't mean to feel this way. 

Sorry, just trying to express what being trans means to me. I hear stories of Texas and am appalled at the injustice we get over there. At least where I live ,in Sydney Australia, no one passes laws against our gender and almost everyone is polite enough to at least not say anything. I hope for the best for you, for a peaceful life spent just being who you are, not what the Texas government thinks you should be!
Not transfem but I just wanted to say you look super pretty! Love your makeup and lashes and freckles :D

Also I'm a trans man in California, things are nice here when it comes to many people being accepting if you can afford the high rent and or find roomates to help with that.
Not a state but I’m Australian and it’s pretty good here. People are largely accepting and hrt isn’t too expensive
I live northwest Oregon. Just outside of Portland, in Oregon City. This seems like a really good place to live. /shrugs
Strangely, a pretty conservative part of Canada. Oilsands counrty is weird, and there's a ton of trans people here, which you wouldn't think, but here we are.
Ontario
Also in TX and it is not good where I’m at. I just want to be able to exist without fearing for my safety.
Pittsburgh, feeling better after the election went well for PA.
I'm also in Texas wanna hang out?
1.) I love Washington and you’d fit right in in Seattle

2.) You’re so pretty, stay strong Queen.
Texas as well girly. And unfortunately I can't move away as I don't make enough at work
I’m in New Hampshire and it’s pretty chill, almost everyone I’ve met is cool with me being trans, there is like two people. It’s definitely not the best in the country but I’m never worried about my rights being taken away, live free or die is literally our motto. All in all I can’t complain, it’s chill and it’s my home so I never plan on leaving.
hey tattoo twins!
Not Utah 🥺
Leave Texas. Asap. I just did and it's infinitely better.
I live in Portland and i feel pretty safe here!
Are there any cities that are affordable and also trans-friendly? I ask because red places tend to be affordable but transphobic and blue places tend to be more transfriendly but also expensive.
I live in Indiana (in one of few parts that aren't too bad), but I hope to move back to Michigan in a few years. You're super pretty by the way!
THANK YOU for this post since as a mom of a gorgeous trans daughter here in Texas, I will move out ASAP but now have better ideas as to where
get out while you can, Abbot is escalating things down there and is starting to make a record of people who have changed their gender on their driver's license. This of course is a precursor for forced identifiers then, rounding up, and then camps if you catch my drift
Hey, I'm a trans guy but I used to live in texas, and I can say I've been happier homeless in vermont then I ever was housed in texas. Texas sucks ass. Move to VT, the weather is amazing over the summer and the people aren't shitty.
not a girl but im also in Texas 🥲
Texas :(
currently in texas, absolute hell. i lived in washington which wasnt as bad but tbh i feel safe being in this country. if youre looking to move and it cant be out of country washington (west side) is a good choice for the most part
Don't let them put you on that fuckin' registry if you're not already on it. I'd highly consider getting the fuck out of that state in light of the new bill that's being tabled that does...basically what the Nazi's did for any group of people they didn't want existing in the future.
The good ol mountains of Colorado are fantastic
Ignoring the question entirely, you are gorgeous
Minnesota and thriving :)
Not trans but an ally; 
It's super mentally wearing living here in Houston just as someone who is left leaning.. 

I couldn't imagine the stuff you must go through. Stay strong
Sweden 🇸🇪 😅🙃
Now I know that doesn’t help whatsoever, but just know that there are places in the US and in the rest of the world who would welcome you 😌 I wish you all the luck in finding that place that makes you feel safe and at home 💙
Washington! It’s great up here. Weather is nice and as long as you stay on the west side everyone is very polite. Eastern side is a different story but it’s mostly cows over there. Almost every shop in major cities has a pride flag and I’ve never had any issues getting gender affirming care here. There’s lots of room to spread out too; forest goes on forever, which I think is nice if you want to get away from things. Spokane is notorious for being gay as hell too.
The cities in NY aren't bad at all but I would avoid rural regions. To be honest I'm not as comfortable as I would like anywhere in the US. I'm planning on migrating to Canada in the future.
I live in TN so I can't help ya there and empathize. But totally unrelated and unsolicited but meant only as a compliment, how are you not modeling???
I live in Florida. Just walked out of the gun store after buying a gun. completely dressed up 🤣 I don’t change my voice too so it’s a dead give away. Everyone was nice though
Colorado
I had no idea! Thanks for all the replies to this post. As the mother of a ftm trans teen, finding a place he feels safe and comfortable odds so important. But i didn’t realize that some states pay for the care! My own insurance i pay for won’t cover his T or even the mental health therapy because he has gender dysphoria.
In other news. The Texas government has compiled a list of everybody who changed gender on driving licence
You are like breathtakingly gorgeous, so pretty
I'm in Florida it's sucky. It's a great place to live but it's a lot of old white privileged people. I am meeting new people at the MCC. I used to live in Milwaukee and it was pretty good but the winters suck. They have lots of groups and a decent LGBT center trans groups and resources. A GCS surgeon a county away. They had 2 clinics for trans HRT. One was in the Hispanic community and the other was on the other side of the city. There are resources in place there even a counseling center that specializes in trans people. They do the letters you need and everything. They have a pride fest that 30,000 people attend before covid. The university had a huge drag show in the Arena. I miss it I had lots of friends gay lesbian and trans friends. They had kids groups and senior group. Lots of programs for the young adults. But again cold and snow. The summer are not too bad not like down here lol.
I’m in maryland and I’m not out but people are nice enough, probably cause I’m in moco, other more rural areas are somewhat red and also moco is hella expensive
Just wanna drop in and say that you are gorgeous
I live in NY but it is expensive and cold. Also less friendly to LGBTQ if you are outside the cities. Not super bad, but not the best either.
You are so beautiful
I’m sure it’s Texas and not you.
Damn, I need to move to Texas.
This picture is crust
I think ur blessed to b here maybe u should try living in the Middle East,heard they have more…..
[deleted]
I live in Florida here is very chill ❤️❤️
It didn't. It's just you.
I’m feelin this a bit in NC. Anyone have any opinions on Colorado or Washington state?
I moved from Texas to California about 2 years ago and am so happy I did. I don't think I could have come out if I hadn't.
Lancashire is the best state of the United Kingdom 👌
I moved to socal a while ago and I feel like a weight was lifted from my shoulders. Its not perfect here either but seeing my rights protected did a lot for my own mental health. Healthcare pros here are under legal pressure to treat you respectfully. I felt really unsafe living in Montana beforehand. I don’t pass and I’m super tall so I got a lot of concerned, glowering looks. Also, we painted a rainbow on a sidewalk and people showed up with actual pitchforks and washed away all our nice chalk work. Small rural towns 🤷‍♀️. It sucks cus I love Montana. Well.. western Montana anyway. Hope things get better for you!!
Highly recommend Delaware
You're gorgeous. I'm from Maryland and while it's fairly progressive there are still enough people who aren't accepting, especially the further you get from DC. I've recently moved out and to the UK but I haven't really started exploring too much yet.
I'm kinda stuck in Oklahoma, me and my wife keep talking about Seattle or somewhere near there though.
My most experience is with NJ and I would say by and large it's safe, just need to be aware of where you go  but there's also some really awesome places that feel really welcoming (Asbury Park, Princeton). It is suuuuuuper expensive so idk if it's easy to find affordable housing but I recommend it.
I live in the Tri-State area so I’d say a 6 but it really depends on the area I’m in, I live a pretty stealth life socially but I’m also a baby so I’m not at my full peak yet but In terms of the discourse around trans people I’d say a FUCKIN negative 1
**Not** any state in Brazil
A state of depression
the area of western mass i live in is very chill/accepting
New York City is actually really cool about being trans in some parts,like for instance the metropolitan opera house has pronoun and gender identity preferences as part of the process of buying tickets and they’ve always treated me with nothing but respect,same in nice restaurants and museums
Not a state, but DC is great. I’m sorry you’re in Texas…that’s a scary place to be rn. Stay safe!
Ohio
Texas girl here. I completely get the struggle. 💙🩷🩶🩷💙
I'm living in Madison WI with my gf and it's the best, I left KY behind and everything is so much better here
Definitely not Missouri lmfao
The western half of Washington fits the bill, but the second you go past mount baker it's full ass redneck mode.
Not oklahoma
I’m scare to live in Florida sometimes.
I'm in interior Alaska. I thought I'd see a lot of hatred here, but most people in this town really don't care.
Maine is great so long as you stay south/east of Augusta. Portland (Portland Maine) is very chill
I feel for you.. I'm in San Antonio... Hope you're staying safe.
Northern Illinois is okay I guess, then again I’m not out yet
 Virginia. Closer to DC
I'm in the DFW area. :(
Currently living in Florida but planning to move back to NYS next summer
I live in Arkansas and it sucks 😭. Probably the worst state to be a trans person tbh. Wish ya luck red states suck 🙄
Colorado
Texas is huge, there are places good and bad  everywhere , you choose what to do where to go and will always be safe. Develop a hobby and stick to it. Photo shoot, etc.,

Get a job that keeps u busy, like social worker,  nurse etc. I'm in a RED state SC , one older guy was bothering me , touching me. Called cops and said I'm a trans, 15 mins they were at my door step 2 cops, they warned the guy, next call from me its straight to jail for him . I was impressed, that fool bends his head down and keeps 10 ft from me.
You look gorgeous
North Carolina sweetie.
Sweetie I totally sympathize. Former Houston girl here. I moved to Hawaii to transition because I knew it would be too much to take there. I'm happy as can be here. I get the occasional asshole but that's anywhere. For the most part people are respectful and treat me like just another human being.
kansas surprisingly! it is still a red state and there’s a lot of unpleasant people but some of the bigger cities tend be super progressive (ie wichita, topeka, or kck)
It's pretty safe in Colorado! Just expensive...
Texan here too. Better than Utah where I grew up, I guess.
avoid rural michigan by all means
Wow, you are so pretty! I hope to look even half as good as you do.

I just came out about a month ago so I'm not quite ready to go out dressed the way I feel. But, one night a week or so ago I was really drunk and decided to walk to Walgreens. I have fake boobs I wear inside the house. I love them, I feel so female with them. But, I completely forgot I had them on. So, when I get to Walgreens I unzip my coat and I had a tank top or something on. And walk around the store and then finally go to the register and that's when I realized I still them on and my coat was open, so it was very evident. I tried to cover up but I was so drunk lol. I have no idea how the cashier reacted because I, again, I was drunk. But, when I sobered up I realized what I had done. 

Honestly, being drunk has gotten me to do a few things I never thought I'd have to courage to do. I came out because I was drunk and that turned out incredibly well and I'm glad I did. Still not ready to go out SOBER like this, but I hope to work up to finally doing that.

P.S. I live in the Chicago suburbs
New York (city), California, maybe some parts of Florida...
Maryland is okay. We've got our fair share of bigots in rural areas, but I've never really felt too unsafe as a trans person in Baltimore. We're a blue state and pretty good in terms of trans stuff legally, and depending on where you are the healthcare is super inclusive! I go to Chase Brexton for my primary care and therapy, they have a couple locations and they pretty much specialize in minority inclusive and nondiscriminatory care. Hell, my therapist is also trans lmao.
Egg cracked in Utah, said to myself “I need to get the F out of here!” And moved to Washington, much happier!!
Iowa has been really nice to me while I've been here for college. Where I'm from in North Carolina was pretty good too, despite being a military community.
I'm partial to liquid, personally.
living in like southern maine area ive never really had any issues personally. I mean there are weirdos here who I don’t trust but in my experience it’s mostly fine
I've seen lots of nods to Washington here already, and I will throw my support that way as well. It's not exactly cheap, but I've felt extremely safe and everyone has been welcoming. I'm rarely misgendered, and the most transphobic folks have gotten with me in the wild is an uncomfortable long stare. 

I live on the Eastside near Seattle, and I know lots of queer and GNC people in the area who are just comfortable not living the binary life and just doing their own thing. I've found it's actually helped me become a lot more comfortable in my shell.

Washington state laws require insurance companies cover trans health care, and while not every health care group provides trans specific care, many hospitals offer trans specific care. My hospital doesn't offer trans specific services, but my PCP was happy to refer me to doctors outside their group that do. State laws also treat gender identity as a protected class. 

You probably want to stay west of the Cascades, but I haven't had issues traveling in state. Most locations from Olympia up to the CA border are pretty LGBTQ+ friendly.
Sorry you were in a bad mood (I *totally* understand; I'm in Florida and the Guv'nor passed a bill saying ""no more Medicaid for *any* transgender care!"") -

But you're still really *beautiful*!  I wish I could be as pretty as you!
Fellow Texan here. Know that I feel your pain and it is one of the bigger reasons why I haven't started on HRT or go out as myself in public. Know you aren't alone.
I’m in ma but I have to be honest just watching it from afar is still terrifying
Massachusetts
Don't move to Oklahoma...although marijuana is easily accessible here. The majority of the state hasn't caught up to non traditional things quite yet
A state of denial..
Still cis tho
I live in Phoenix, Arizona and have never had any trouble with being trans here.
I love living in the rural part of Texas and new mexico I live right on the new mexico texas border. I'm a country girl through and through. Honestly I can't see why you don't like texas
Chicago is the way to go! Fuck the rest of IL tho
I'm in Chicago and I feel as safe as one does in Chicago.
Illinois.  People mind their own business here.
State of denial
Colorado is great! And contrary to popular belief we don't only have skiing(you can also snowboard)
So far....so good in rural Alaska!
I’m also a Texas resident unfortunately, but if you go further south (like San Antonio and down- I live and grew up in San Antonio) it’s actually really nice and way less bigoted. I’d say Texas is way more left-leaning than the southeastern states next to it, so don’t go more east than you have to. I moved to New Mexico close by for college which has been really good so I hope you find luck and move somewhere where you feel safe! I heard Colorado and Oregon are accepting states as well and far less dangerous than Texas or New Mexico
Oregon isn't terrible as long as you stay in the PDX area. Hell, even the Washington side is pretty good imo.
La west Hollywood north Hollywood San Francisco
I can safely say **not** Alabama. It's like Texas, but worse in just about every conceivable way.

I have been looking into this for a bit recently, and we've mostly settled Maryland as our best relocation option. Safe blue state that's still close enough that we can get to our extended family in Tennessee in a day's drive.
I live in Maine and I'm pretty happy here and feel safe
Come to Oregon! We have legal protections (for all the good it does, but it's a good start) It's expensive to rent or buy though.
As much as I don't much care for this state I live in, because of many of its higher costs of living and such, I believe that California is the only one best suited for Transgender folk. I have through work been in almost every major city in the US, and nowhere else compares to the comfort of knowing that California has my back and has the protections to go with it!

Please keep in mind that there are wackos in every state these days, and California is certainly no exception for persons who want to destroy us, particularly gun-wielding wacktards, they seem to be in every state these days, unfortunately!
I lived most of my life in California. Wish I was still there. But now in Utah and I have to say that I am surprised at the acceptance I've seen by most people.   


I did read today that TX is gathering driver's license data on trans people. How low can they go??  


[https://news.yahoo.com/texas-creates-chilling-registry-16-181000674.html](https://news.yahoo.com/texas-creates-chilling-registry-16-181000674.html)
I could never even set foot in Texas. I would be afraid for my life. I completely understand how just all the constant transphobic rhetoric there could be taxing, but you look cis to me. What sort of stuff are you facing yourself?
I love in Britain so I constantly have to deal with transphobia too :(. I doubt it's as bad as Texas but I feel I yk
Colorado. Specially northern Colorado and the Denver/Boulder area
MA is one of the best, if not *the* best state in terms of trans-positive laws/environment, at least in the US.

If that isn't possible than a buncha other areas along the coasts are probably a good bet.
I feel pretty safe in Southern California. Most of the time at any rate.
I grew up in Texas, which was kinda really bad, but I’m in Oregon now and absolutely loving it here
I live on the Virginia side of the DC area. I've always felt safe here.
Please don't leave us..I'll protect you.
In Chicago, I feel safe from a queer legislation standpoint, but whackos be hatecriming out here :/
I love it here in Colorado. Just right outside of Denver is pretty good. I've went out full fem like three times now (I dont pass well) And only got a weird look from a dude once.
Massachusetts is…okay. Just stay away from… everyone. Informed consent Planned parenthood is a god send tho.
I agree that the state overall is not great, but Austin has been pretty good for me.
Washington. Not trans, but one of my kid's is and this place has been nothing but supportive and amazing through it all. To be more clear, Seattle and it's surrounding areas.
Girl, I feel you.  I’m a Bexar County special myself at 64 years of age.
Michigan is fine, just stay around the metropolitan/ city areas.
I'd say come to Canada, but it's such a BS process... I'd accept you nonetheless, buy it's still awful to deal with lol.
NY
I live in MA but the wrong part of it for feeling 100% safe so my opinion is a bit biased. However most of the state is alright and Medicaid covers my girl drugs so I just think “well if this is the worst part of the state to live then moving literally anywhere else will be a quality of life improvement”
I'm jealous of your gorgeous self, sheesh ❤️ keep slayin, girl
I’m living in Washington. I feel safer here than I have in a very very long time
There is a HUGE trans population in Fayetteville, AR. I know the state laws are some of the worst for trans rights, but there is a massive effort by trans people to make it a safe place for us. I’m doing what part I can. There’s thousands of us here :)
Washington state, just stick to the sound where all the people are.
New Jersey, tho planning to teach overseas to escape all of the everything
Massachusetts
well, i’m ftm, but i feel pretty safe in michigan :) it’s really chill here, not much happens, and we have rights, and an epic governor
Oregon it’s fairly progressive here
San Diego, CA.  Good population, generally feel safe.
I may not be a trans women but I am transman. But so far Washington/Oregon are v good ones
I’m in oregon and only semi-often do I fear for my life in public :D
Come to Buffalo NY babe. It’s still relatively cheap and the only states I feel comfortable living in are NY and CA…and Cali is too expensive and too many earth quakes. 

I s2g it doesn’t snow as much as the media makes it out lol
Vermont
I live in California. By far one of the most progressive states still, and I have all if my healthcare free here. Including all of my gender affirmative procedures I will be getting soon. We have specific laws to force Medicaid to pay for anything related to trans care.
Nebraska has been pretty ok so far! I mean it might not be 100% supportive everywhere... But I've had almost NO problems
Illinois.  


It's a state that is surrounded by red but the governor, J.B Pritzker was raised in a family that advocated for LGBTQIA2S+ rights and he continues to do so. His position as governor is almost indestructible because most residents love the guy.  


Middle illinois is a mild no though but. Up by Chicago or down in The Metro East it's pretty safe.  
The people who are bigots though don't talk about it and keep it to themselves though.
I'm in Delaware, but honestly Philly has a massive LGBT presence and a dedicated LGBT healthcare clinic that I absolutely love. Plus you get SEASONS! As someone who lived in a neighboring state, I know how shitty it is in that region, but coming to the north was absolutely a good move for me
You are beautiful
Washington State. Chiller here, better healthcare too.
Currently living in Iowa. Feel pretty good, but unfortunately the governor is working hard to change that. I could honestly see the state backsliding quite a bit in the coming years if nothing changes, so I'll probably leave once I'm out of college.
Nsw aus
I live in Pittsburgh and it’s pretty good
Texas is a cesspool of shit. So happy I'm in a blue state!!! Good vibes sent your way ❤️
I live in California Southern California I love it here no issues
You're so pretty! I've been to Oregon and it seems pretty good! Also, reminder: not everyone on here are girls, since this is a sub for all trans people, not just transfems!
I live in Washington State and I feel safer here.
Virginia ain't too bad if you're in the north-- unless you're in highschool ig
I mean I live in Colima State, Mexico and our mayor is from a rightwing party and she supports LGBT rights and people just don’t care. Also changing your legal name and gender is extremely easy (no surgery, no proof of gender dysphoria, no judge authorization and sometimes it’s even free).
Alaska.  It's surprisingly friendly here, at least so far.  Anchorage and Juneau are very blue and have a big queer population.  The downside is a lack of trans healthcare options.  We have some informed consent clinics for HRT but not really any specialists like endos, and there are pretty much zero options for surgeries here.
I had lived in Portland, Oregon for most of my life (1-18). Most of Portland and the surrounding cities and towns are decent. Just don’t walk around at night in downtown Portland without a friend. Although you could say that of any town, to be honest. There is still a decent amount of unrest from the police clashing with protesting civilians from what my friends down there tell me.

I am currently living in Washington. Olympia, Tumwater, Lacey, Tacoma, and Seattle all have prominent queer communities. I see girls and boys of all ages and stages of their transition all the time here in the Olympia/Tumwater/Lacey area. There are churches here (I don’t go personally) that welcome queer people without the pressure to conform or change who they are. The pride parade was kind of shit this year but that’s mainly because of COVID. Hopefully next year will be better.

I go to college locally and have met several trans and genderqueer/non-conforming people within my time on campus. 

Buses are safe spaces and they WILL kick people off the bus if they start spouting queerphobic and/or racist nonsense. They take the time to ban bigots or belligerent people from all buses in Intercity Transit. I have been on a bus where a man was kicked off and when I transferred to a different bus later on, he tried to get on the bus only to be kicked off before he could even sit down. They WILL strand some idiots ass, which is great. They are also completely free which is awesome!

Stay away from Yelm and the lower populated rural areas. They’re a lot more toxic and conservative-religious. Tacoma and Seattle are... less put together—they’re dirtier and more run down in many areas. Seattle is a lot like Portland, but it has a different flavor of ‘progressive city’. It's history is quite interesting—did you know that there’s a whole underground city that’s been left underneath the current city for over a hundred years? Flooding and massive fires pushed the city to build over the then-current buildings, sealing the old city underground. People still used the underground, having shops and businesses and houses down there for several years afterwards, but it became unstable and people migrated aboveground. After a new generation was born and the city expanded many people never knew it even existed. You can go on a tour these days to a few of the more stable areas of underground Seattle.

Anyway, sorry about the random infodump. I enjoy Washington, as long as you stick close to the more progressive cities and towns.
I got out of Austin in July, and I currently live in Kansas City.  I know by every metric this *should* be just as bad as down south, but honestly this is the most open, vibrant, and welcoming place I've ever been.  It's home.
I have a lot of great experiences in Colorado! I’m not a full-time resident there (college student) but I get most of my transition care in the state, and the state is really great when it comes to the legal protections. Just stick to the more populated areas, I’ve heard the more rural areas can get bad.
Michigang 😎
Sacramento is cool but then again I came from the ghetto so my judgement may not be the best to properly label what and what isn't ""safe"" lol
I’m in NY but not NYC so it’s not the greatest but I can’t imagine what living in Texas is like rn.
New York has been very kind to me
Oregon. I’m still very masculine looking and even then people call me my name, use she/her, and compliment my outfits. Even strangers
NC isn't half bad.
Many Texans in the California desert but, it's Cali and affordable
Come to Reno NV!
Texas here too, not too keen to start transition how this state is going
The right part of Cali...North of Medford in Oregon & Wash all cool
""Wherever you go, there you are.""
I would love to move to Colorado or Minnesota!
What about Canada ? Is Canada a safe and happy place ?
I live in WA, mostly blue states are good. But abroad, Spain would be best.
Pennsylvania. I’ve lived in the Philadelphia metro area my entire life and never seen anything too extreme or unavoidable in terms of bigotry. Just don’t head into Pennsyltucky
Go down to Miami. CALIFORNIA sucks. Most of the east coast sucks. Midwest and northwest are nothing to brag about, and I would blow this pop stand we call the US if I could.
Not a state, gf and I are up in canada and I've never once been scared to hold her hand in public.
Start with a heavily safe blue one. NY, OR WA are the three best.
not a girl, but surprisingly..? ohio isn’t that bad if you stick to the populated areas and away from cornfields and emptiness. maryland is also great!
Moving to California soon for work, super excited! 😊
Im gonna say Cali although i realize how incredibly priveliged that is. 😅
Maryland's very chill from my experience. Just steer clear of Ceciltucky and you'll be fine!
Cifornia is very trans supportive. For example, theres been somecnew legislation as a trans safety state. Expensive in some areas tho.
Straight(bicurious) guy here swinging in thread to say- Saw you on feed and insta reaction was ""she's really cute"" so keep on keeping  on and fuck the haters fam
Move to Kentucky
Colorado is still good. My gf and I just moved here, but I lived in Colorado growing up.
First off, you're gorgeous! Secondly, we moved up to Washington so I could transition and everyone here has been really welcoming. We're in a pretty small town and haven't had any trouble.
I moved from Houston to Atlanta. Idk if anywhere in the US is ""safe"", but at least here it's safer.
California.
I’ve lived in Cali and WNY now. People are just wildly different, but no one where I’ve stayed has been mean! Both are pretty accepting. Just don’t go to bad areas, those aren’t really safe for anyone
California. Avoid the mountains.
I'd recommend Canada or New Zealand
Western Washington is pretty great for trans folks. Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, all of these places have queer communities. I've never had a negative experience in any of these places, but lots and lots of positive ones :)
Not GA
Minnesota. I got HRT a month after my first appointment, and my first appointment was only a phone call because of covid. My brother, my parents, and my extended family and friends are all being very supportive. Coming out one at a time to my co-workers at a fairly well paying job with decent benefits. Minneapolis and all of southeast MN are very LGBT friendly.
California is kinda neutral. As in no one here gives a F.
Arizona is okay, despite the horrible summers we get and weirdly cold snaps we’re in right now.
With those nails you should be quite safe. I would trade states for provinces - and hang with us.
I live in California, which is great but alas it isn't the accepting areas on the coast like LA or San Diego, and it's instead the awful and insanely bigoted rural desert areas
Come here to NJ we got right but we’re fucked up in different ways.
California
COLORADO!!!!
I'm in Florida.. I feel safe, but also itching to go somewhere different.. im in between happy and unhappy here, and the queer dating pool in my area is more of a puddle.
Massachusetts.  Fortunately a haven.  Our sympathies girl, hope you get out.
Come up north. New England (from my lifetime experience) is tolerant and accepting. Just don’t sit at green lights or take too long with your coffee order.
California !
Fellow queer in Texas, just saying I'm with you on this, it sucks here right now
minnesota feels safe, but i go to college in iowa ,,, it sucks
Definitely NOT Georgia, that's for sure
Colorado
New Zealand and Australia are technically states that I can suggest? Right?
I live in iowa and I feel freaking fantastic here. Despite our bigoted governors and officials the folks around here are super nice and not judgy. Even those that don’t like you are kind enough to not say anything.
Washington has been good to me and my fellow trans folks here. It ain't perfect, but probably one of the best state for trans people imo.
Hi I just wanted to say I think you’re beautiful!
Washington state, but I don't pass well at all so idk what it's like to be hated in that way

Also

Are you transfemme?
West side of Washington State is pretty good. The mid size to larger cities are the best. I'm not trans but we are very accepting up here!
Hug
There’s not many unfortunately, but California is OK even though it has its problems but it’s much better than Texas or Florida or any of those other southern states
California seems to be pretty safe separated from all the hate. If you need a couch to crash I live in socal and would be happy to put up a refugee for a few weeks while they get their footing 🥰
I just moved to Mass. Traffic is nuts. It's cold as shit. I share a parking lot with a gang of turkeys. But I never worry about someone busting down the door when I'm pissing and seeing my Glock dangling daintily above the rim of the toilet.

It's also expensive as shit to live here, but that's basically every city in America now.
NY has been amazing to me. I’ve felt unsafe maybe like twice ever, but for the most part everyone is pretty accepting.

I really hope you get a chance to get out of there and to somewhere better. Keep slaying though no matter where you are 💅🏼
The Seattle area feels safe enough.
I live in the Midwest, Kansas to be specific. Wichita is pretty nice.
I just moved to Colorado from Dallas. Hands down best thing I have ever done.
Come to WA girl!
I live in Deer Park, TX  & I do not feel safe. It feels like everyone you talk to is just smiling until the death squads come & they can point you out to them. The looks, the angry glares, the persistent dead naming, purposeful misgendering, the evil politicians, & knowing the majority of your neighbors voted for them. It's overwhelming.
New Mexico - Albuquerque and Santa Fe, specifically. We have anti-discrimination protections built into our state Human Rights Act and a very active NM Transgender Resource Center in Albuquerque.
I'm in Canada and it's pretty safe
Wonderful girl🤤🤤🤤
Southern California
Reno, NV
I live in NJ and feel safe here!
Im in Illinois. It isnt too bad here.
SoCal
Tulsa, OK
least u look like a girl, and not a fucking dude like most of us still look like
Belgium
My aunt lives in Colorado so I’ve spent a good amount of time there myself. It’s got some positives and negatives but it’s a nice state if you stay out of rural towns. The national parks are a good place too.
new jersey is great! it's super easy to get hrt, and that's just one example. honestly i think it's one of the best places to live in the world

side note - you're beautiful sister ;)
Michigan and any State that isn’t Red
Here in California, haven’t had too many issues. Then again I’m only a month into my transition.
Pennsylvania
Washington state seems ok, western Washington anyway. I was able to get hrt with informed consent from planned parenthood.
I can tell you, florida isn’t it.
In the US, anything outside of larger cities is going to be shit and should be avoided.
Norcal! Expensive AF but super cool and chill! Youre welcome here always!
If money is not a problem, I suggest SoCal or nYc
Northern suburbs of Chicago could work, they’re pretty leftist
I'm trans masc but my fiancee is a trans lady and we're in Phoenix Arizona. I wouldn't live in the rural parts, but the metro areas of Phoenix, Tucson, and Flagstaff are pretty safe. The Southwest Center in Phoenix does informed HRT and is a queer focused healthcare center too
Chicagoooo
I'm actually agender, so I don't have the exact same experience, but I think I can say for certain that the west coast is definitely more accommodating than Texas. Of course you'll run into a few assholes, as with any place, but to just name a few examples, there are a bunch of laws in place to protect from discrimination, and in certain states you can legally get your gender listed as whatever you identify with on your driver's license, no need to have a psychological review or whatever, you can just say ""I am a woman/man/other"" and that's that (Mine is listed as 'x' for the 'other' category). 
I used to live in the DFW area during high school, and I left as soon as I could. Almost been 10 years now and I can say it has been the best decision I have ever made. I have been trying to get my LGBT friends to leave ever since, but with the housing market like it is, it's damn near impossible without having a partner you can split rent with or a roommate lined up.
I live in Denver, Denver and boulder are good areas for lgbtq+ individuals
I'm not a member of this group it just randomly popped up for me. I just wanted to say you have a striking face. As a small mouthed woman I'm especially impressed with your pout.
Pennsylvania if you stay away from the rural areas
Currently in Minnesota with my transbian girlfriend, and it's quite nice. A little bland if you're not in the cities, but plenty of good folks.
Vermont was chill and safe. Seattle has been pretty alright so far, plus there’s a pride flag about every 50 ft.
I’m in Chicago land. It’s pretty chill here if you want to stay in central US. Just don’t go too far away from the city, it gets red fast.
WA state has some decent places.
I'm not trans. I'm a cis male with a trans nephew. In western Washington and Oregon, I believe you'd easliy find a community you'd feel comfortable in. Stick to the cities (Seattle, Bellingham, Portland, Eugene. Small towns, rich suburbs and capitol cites (at least in the NW) tend to harbor righties and are still backwards af.
Colorado's alright, at least in the Denver area, Fort Collins, and *maybe* Pueblo and parts of the mountains. I'd stay the hell away from Colorado Springs, Grand Junction, or most of the eastern plains though.
I don't live in the USA, but in Czechia. I feel quite safe here, even though some things suck, if you compare Czechia to the rest of Eastern Europe, it's actually the best.
I'm not American, but several of my trans friends seem to be having a pretty solid time in Denver
Washington State and despite the weather taking some getting used to, we do have some of the best trans health care this side of California without California’s high cost of living
Come to Portland, Oregon
Minnesota, Minneapolis.
NY is pretty accepting. I haven't had much discrimination.
NSW Australia
I'm also a Texas girl but me and my friend are trying to get to Colorado
California, but you gotta hve $$$ or skills or.friends, unfortunately.
Any of the Left Coast States (CA, OR, WA) are pretty safe.  Emphasis on the coast though.  Far inland areas are a more of a mixed bag.  I live near San Diego and never have any problems.  I'm happy and grateful to be living here.  All the big cities are pretty accepting.  Obviously you still have to take common sense precautions wherever you are.  But even if you chose to live in a rural area it would still be better than TX or any red state.  The political situation is far better.  Politicians aren't trying to exterminate us!
Sounds like Minnesota is a safe bet.  We'd love to have you.  Guaranteed to feel like home.
Good question, however I’m not amarican
cali or mexico
CA
Colorado (between Denver and Boulder) is good, and Oregon (along the west side) is great
Excuse me but you should feel safe everywhere.  Texas is kinda its own thing though.  You're welcome in cali.
Curious - What State do our black sisters feel safe in? That's my question.
Atlanta is actually fire. The rest of Georgia, not so much
Washington. Specifically Auburn and Seattle
Florida or ny the lgbtq+ community is pretty much big there if you know where to look
Are there happy trans people?
Lmao sadly can’t recommend where I live cuz I got told I can’t get stuff at a store today 🤪so never shopping there ig
I live in Chicago. Millions of LGBT. Very friendly communities.
Japan
I’m in AL and honestly I don’t feel safe. I’ve heard the IL is on the safe side so I’ve considered moving there if I ever get a chance. I’m just saying if you can you would probably be safer almost anywhere but Texas. Stay safe!
California already loves you.
Come to Washington.
I feel relatively safe on the other side of the planet, in Australia.

What I see of America goddamn terrifies me.
Outside of the US
I am in love
Europe baby
I'm sure there is a lot of shit here in Texas. I know, I have always lived here. 

But, honestly there are a lot of people that will at least listen and get to know you before any bs...
I just moved from NC to CA. California is way more expensive, but it’s been worth it for my mental and emotional health.
Canada... But some provinces are not doing so well with most having conser premiers wanting to gut healthcare to introduce US style health care system to benefit their buddies. 

This past summer a few redditors told me about checking out the Connect Clinic a virtual gender clinic based in Toronto that offered services to all of Ontario (via it being virtual). Dipshit Ford changed the funding for virtual care recently and just last month Connect Clinic shut down due to a lack of funding for it's services leaving many gender non conforming Ontarians (especially remote locations) out in the cold. 

So I dunno we are still doing better than the vast majority of the US, but shits getting scary here too. But if y'all wanna pad our voting numbers that'd be amazing!
Not Missouri!
Come to Michigan love ❤️
Southern California. Come.
California girl here it's meh here in California really but I'm might be relocating to Hong Kong after the holidays
You are gorgeous. No one should have to live in fear hunny 
Come to Va !
Texan by birth, California resident by decision. Its a big place- whatever you're looking for, you'll probably find it in California. Its almost like a country within a country. Yeah, its still in the US, but like, thats a different place.
MA is amazing, but pretty expensive if you're in or near Boston. I'd never live in any of the old confederate states at this point.
Oh I feel you. I’m in Tennessee. TBH Knoxville has a big queer community and isn’t all bad, but definitely we don’t have much local government support. I hear decent things about Virginia from my husbands family
It cost me $3000 but I moved to Pittsburgh.  Immediately qualified for SNAP and Medicaid and getting the best health care I've gotten in decades.  There's also one of the best free trans clinics I've ever encountered downtown called Central Outreach.
Come to Delhi and see your physical state deteriorate as well.
Your always welcome to be yourself in seattle!
… if you can afford it ☹️
NC?
Southern Pennsylvania's been nice to me so far. I'm sure not everywhere is PA is great for trans folk, but I have yet to have a single bad encounter with anyone
Europe lol
Spain
Come to California!
Minnesota
Minnesota is alright. Bring snow tires
new york state has been good to me and in 4 years of being out trans i've had no problems
I know you may be going through a rough time but I just wanna say you are slaying! You are gorgeous!
When did you get the semicolon tat?
New Zealander has entered the chat
absolutely not in the netherlands lmao
Hello from France,  you may be feel safe at San Francisco
We like hawaii but portland and seattle were nice too.
Canada
Not a transgirl but try the Seattle area
Honestly, Austin, Texas is an amazing area if you can afford it.
Come to Vermont! It’s very trans friendly here. You can’t throw a rock without hitting someone visibly trans, so make sure you only throw snowballs of which there are plenty.
Well, i can tell you one state to add to the avoid list: South Carolina
I'm in a very liberal area of NC and there's a wonderful little queer community here!
Honestly, outside of the states, I personally feel safer inside the European Union
Iowa. Iowa is generally republican but the people just care for eachother. So you should feel happy and safe.
My god you're gorgeous! 🖤
NY
Arizona
Living in Texas has clearly taken a toll on their entire population’s mental health.
Michigan. I honestly feel safe here.
its pretty far away, but maine is pretty chill if you don't go too far north. obviously there are still old trumpies, but they *tend* to keep themselves or the worst they'll do is make a mean comment. although im nonbinary so i don't know if it counts, but i know a few trans women from here and they tend to have similar experiences as i do.
Europe.
[removed]
Omaha, NE is fine. For now
Europe
Canada
Having a fine time in Illinois as long as your near Chicago or a college town
New south wales
Where in Texas?
Massachusetts
New Mexico has been pretty great for my daughter so far!
Wherever you go, there you are
I can tell you what state NOT to go to… Florida
It depends. 

My wife and I are liberal and hate the MAGA Baptist crap here in Texas. 

But of the places we’d like to move, we really can’t afford. 

Although moving may decrease some stress it may increase other stress factors in your life.
Colorado is good, but once you get out of Denver and Boulder, you find a lot of red
I prefer “Not-Texas.”
I live in Vermont and yeah the town I'm in has pride flags out front of a couple stores but then also the church has a pride flag out front so yeah it's a great town for LGBT+ spaces
Massachusetts
Rarely if ever feel unsafe here in Michigan.  But we're very rare here.  Compared to the Blue bastion states
Stay clear of south dakota. Our state is full of hate. Not even most long term residents that are democrats are welcome here. It's a sad place to live.
Rural Vermont, I loved it there
California
i live in Italy, and despite having good things, peoples mentality isnt much different, hugs, and good luck
Oregon is a great answer. Portland, Eugene, Corvallis, Astoria, Ashland, Bend, Hood River. These are all friendly towns.
Maryland here us on the northern east end are pretty progressive stay 20mins or more away from the west side cus it's just virgina there and VA is greener Texas over there. Want tech or medical feild all where I'm at and we got DC which is pretty progressive TBH ( on the maryland side VA side is stupid.
Chicago is pretty safe and people are supportive
Massachusetts 💯
Kansas is pretty good. And you still are seen as a human with rights to your body's  autonomy. One of the cheapee places to live in the nation. Rent around me is 400 to 1200 for the really nice places. Really some really pretty prairie trails to walk. They people are very welcoming. Just don't be an ass and there are no problems.
Atlanta
I saw the picture, said “Damn!”, then saw the subreddit.
Currently in New Mexico, so many of my fellow queers from neighboring states have pilgrimmaged here, if you’re in a transphobic state please come, I recommend it :)

Runner up is Tulsa, Oklahoma. While the state is garbage, the individual cities much like Austin, TX is a safe haven within it. Lived there for five years and it was pretty okay
New York and California!
Okay I’m going to put in my two cents for Ohio. Yes our state government isn’t exactly the best in trans rights and it is deeply distressing. However, Ohio’s cities are really inclusive. Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, and Dayton all are great places to live as a trans person. But Cincinnati has a great bar scene and pride festival. We also have Equitas health which does a lot of gender affirming care. Of course like any other state there are places that aren’t so inclusive. Mostly rural places but other than that I love living here. Illinois too is great as well.
IL, close to st.louis or chichgo
NY girlie here, I live in a more conservative pocket but I always feel safe never worried about my rights being taken away on a state level. I go to Connecticut too and never run into trouble there
I have heard that Albany is nice.
I live in New York and (while im FTM) I feel relatively safe and with months of coming out I got my hrt. My cousin (mtf) lives in Colorado and she loves it there. Hope this helps!
Dude here (trans man) but currently I live in Virginia but would much prefer living in Colorado. Not only is it much prettier than Virginia and actually affordable, but it (along with California) the most trans friendly state! 

I went to visit my great-grandma once, BEAUTIFUL state. It's cold but gorgeous during the winter. White Christmas..
there's a good community in tulsa and it's not too expensive
Northern Washington
I'm in IL, It's- fine? Ihave no real complaints aside from the utter lack of *anything* to do if you're not in the city. 🙄🙄🙄
Was living in Oklahoma and moved to West Virginia. Astronomically better, but still worse than most of the nation. At least my town scored a perfect score on LGBT Municipal Equality Index.
I live in Pittsburgh, PA. It's not the greatest, but people here are generally accepting, there's a lot of trans people here, and it's a hell of a lot better than where I started in Tennessee so I'll take it.
albany, ny. i dont really try to define myself, but its pretty cheap (and cold) up here and the LGBT community has been very welcoming
I live in Las Vegas, not Nevada. Everywhere else hates us in state (Generalization of course).

Great here, lowish cost of living, lots of LGBTQ resources for everyone on the spectrum.

I'm sorry you aren't feeling well sis. Hopefully you can move somewhere more supportive.
Vermont
Come to Philly we need better looking people here. Btw you are stunning!
Oklahoma and the only thing keeping me going is being married to the most amazing person.  Only reason I'm here is because of my career where I've moved way way way up in a company.  Would not recommend this state.  Stay very far away.
Massachusetts is great. Come join us we may seem unfriendly but we’re epic and policies are great for trans rights
I’m in Texas as well. I despise our state’s “leadership.” If there weren’t so many important reasons for me to stay, I would be long gone from here by now.

EDIT: I should add that I live in Lubbock. Despite it being a blood red “Republican stronghold” city, I don’t get hassled when I go out in public. The only time I get dirty looks is when my wife and I hold hands in public.
Regardless of it all, how tf do you even get clocked anyways. Texas sounds like a real shithole
Any state that is predominantly liberal
State of depression. No fr im in the netherlands its aight
You look absolutely stunning
Surprisingly the part of Florida I live in isn’t as bad as you would expect
I grew up in Tennessee and I’m now living in Ohio. Ohio definitely has lots of problems but I feel safer than I did in Tennessee. Also my college campus is incredibly LGBTQ+ friendly.
im from maryland and it's been pretty good for me here so far
Girls? I know you probably didn't mean anything by it but there are trans guys and nonbinary people here too. I'm a trans guy living in North Carolina, and while it's slightly better than places like Texas it isn't wonderful. I've heard good things about California as well as Northern states.
I live in Los Angeles and there are tons of fun lgbtq events it’s just expensive
I live nowhere close to the US, but from what I have heard, California seems like one of the best options.
Live in the metro Boston area. Been fully out for about a year and have experienced exactly one instance of blatant harassment, and that was online and directed at a trans group I am a part of, not specifically me (so could have been someone from anywhere). 

IRL, have had nothing but support from my friends (including many I had not heard from in a while from my eastern MA high school that is not exactly the most progressive town in the state), feel like I can go pretty much anywhere in the eastern part of the state and feel as safe as any girl, cis or trans. 

Can't speak to Western MA, but as a whole MA has a lot of protections for trans people, including I think requiring insurance companies to cover gender affirming care. Plus lots of resources in the metro Boston area (basically most major hospitals around the city have a gender affirming care clinic or division). Even if not everyone is 100% on board, the general ethos of ""mind your own business"" that gets MA residents labelled as unfriendly plus legal protections means outward discrimination and harassment are just not a big thing here. 

However,  very expensive. Not San Francisco or NYC expensive, but pretty close. But super happy living here regardless and no plans to move out of state ever.
Go to Germany
I live in Sweden so I can't really help but I did want to mention that you look gorgeous

Hugs!
Not a girl, but I feel you on living in Texas.
I’m in Oklahoma right next to Texas. Wish I could be elsewhere.
Most of VT is ok, though Chittenden county and some of the other cities are excellent.
Canada or anywhere else from an Iowan
Wa state in the puget sound area.
New York! No one gives a shit 😎
You’re So pretty!!!
I'm in Western NY, and it's pretty nice here. All the legal protections of living in NY, but also cheaper than NYC or Long Island
California is a state very resistant to national pressure.  Say what you will but California protects veterans and trans residents
That’s a really good question.
I feel your frustrations. Without sounding insensitive, Texas is one of the States People are going to for better prosperity.
You should try changing to a friendlier supportive county of the state. Good luck, In your destiny.
Austin is the only place in TX I can stay in otherwise a good portion of Oregon
I'm a daddy in Texas
canada /j
You look totally cis
Connecticut is very slay and also holy shit you’re pretty
Maine is good insurance wise  and the summers are okay if you like the humidity
Nj is a terrible place but treats the lgbtq fairly well. Schools where I'm from at least are generally pretty inclusive and the legislature is good too.
Even though the rest of Utah is super conservative, Salt Lake is really nice and pro-everything
I'm in the Chicago area and I'm pretty happy but I'd be happier with some trans friends
Sadly I'm also in Texas, not a great state
I feel pretty safe here in Oregon with my trans comrades who are armed to the teeth. Oregon and the PNW has been somewhat of my only home and place I feel safest even tho we got lots of white supremacists. We also got queers who bash back. 

From the looks of it Texas also has a queer community that is armed and ready to protect queer events.
Your very pretty!
Arizona isn't bad if you are in Tucson or Phoenix. I recommend Tucson though, it is cooler than Phoenix and we have a mountain you can go up to escape the heat if you want to get out.
Ok, not related to the question, but you are absolutely stunning!!! :)
Wanna be my roommate? I’m also transfem and living in texas but planning on moving to nyc
I'm in Louisiana and well there's pros and cons so I could be happier in some ways but sadder in others
Why ? What part may depend
I live in a north Atlanta suburb and people here are pretty amazing so far. I have not seen any outright hostility and I get compliments literally every day for how I look, even when I am not trying my best to pass.
Come to Europe, life is better here <3
Im moving to Az from around Chicago soon, very nervous ngl!
CT
Move to Scotland, you'd love it
Personally I am quite partial to solid, but I could understand settling for liquid.
Living in Texas has definitely taken a toll on my mental health. The state is known for its oppressive heat, lack of public transportation, and overall conservative atmosphere that can put a damper on anyone’s mental well-being.  
  
I understand why people choose to live in Texas, but for me, I need more of a supportive and progressive environment to thrive. I think that some of the best states for mental health, in my opinion, are California, New York, Massachusetts, and Colorado.   
  
In California, you can find a progressive atmosphere that is accepting of different lifestyles and beliefs. The state has some of the best universities and employers, so there are plenty of opportunities to further your education and career. Additionally, California offers a wealth of outdoor activities, including beaches, mountains, and forests, to help keep your stress levels in check.   
  
New York is another great state for mental health. It is known for its vibrant culture and inclusive environment, where everyone is welcomed and accepted. New York also has some of the best universities and employers, so it is an ideal place to find a job and further your education. Additionally, the city is home to tons of cultural attractions, restaurants, and parks, so you can find plenty of ways to relax and unwind.   
  
Massachusetts is another great state for mental health. It is known for its progressive atmosphere and welcoming environment. Additionally, Massachusetts has some of the best universities and employers, making it an ideal place to pursue your education and career. It also has plenty of outdoor activities to help keep your stress levels in check, including beaches, mountains, and forests.  
  
Finally, Colorado is an amazing state for mental health. It is known for its progressive atmosphere and accepting environment, making it an ideal place for anyone who wants to live without judgment. Additionally, Colorado has some of the best universities and employers, making it a great place to pursue your education and career. It also has tons of outdoor activities, like skiing, hiking, and camping, to help keep your stress levels in check.   
  
No matter which state you choose to live in, it’s important to find an environment that you feel comfortable and safe in. Make sure to take the time to research each state and figure out which one best suits your needs. Living in a place that supports your mental health will help you to be the best version of yourself.
Northern Virginia
I have quite a few trans and non binary friends here in chicago :D plus if you moved here maybe i could take you out sometime \^.\~
Dfw ain't bad
not Missouri and not Florida
I need to know how u look that good tf
U r damn beautiful. Hope u stay in Texas, economy is booming here and affordable. As long as you stay in major metro hubs, you can find like minded. There’s close mindedness where ever there is closed off, mono cultures. Look for ethnic diversity, higher household income, higher education level, and booming economy, those will have better/open peoples.
I'm as straight as a surveyor's laser but my heart does indeed go out to you precious, wonderful, lovely people. What this young lady is experiencing is exactly why I keep my pro trans
I'm as straight as a surveyor's laser but my heart goes out to you precious, wonderful, lovely people. What this young lady is experiencing is nothing but toro excrement (BS)! You gogirl! ""To thy own self be true.""
I'm as straight as a surveyor's laser but my heart goes out to you precious, wonderful, lovely people. What this young lady is experiencing is nothing but toro excrement (BS)! You go girl!  ""To thy own self be true. ""
You are absolutely STUNNING GOOD GRACIOUS
Come to maryland. The suburbs outside DC or outside Baltimore as well as DC and baltimore themselves, are hugely accepting. For every identity. Maryland also has some of the best anti discrimination laws. If you go to central maryland nobody thinks twice about trans people. It’s a very free place as is Arlington, which is a suburb of DC.
I like Tennessee, and I do feel safe (ish) but I wouldn't say it's a safe state, not an i happy here...I just dunno where else would work out
Some friends of mine moved to NY, both trans.  I don't know their exact reasoning for it though. Good luck!
Come to California...we have...well we have kale but I'm sure someone here makes cupcakes!
This Portlander agrees.
Washingtonian and its pretty similar here, though there are a couple islands on the east side too. Got my E easily and covered by state insurance, and have never really felt unsafe here
I'm planning on moving to Oregon from Boise soon.  How much better is it in that regard?  Don't care about the politics and never have but I don't think trans people should've been politicized
As a transplanted Oregonian, I will say that both Oregon and Washington states model themselves after Texas, lol, it's funny that you feel that way!
This Idahoan can vouch for that. Eastern Oregon and Eastern Washington are basically just Idaho, thankfully without enough votes to turn their own states red.
Eugene here, agreed!!
Mostly same to the north here in WA.
Also watch out for formally dressed demon triangles 

/j
Idaho Jr. 😆

I mean, you're not wrong.
Idaho Jr. 😂😂😂💀
I say the same about Washington!  East of the mountains is just Western Idaho.
I live farther south on the west of the cascades and I feel sonewhat safe but not as safe as if I was in eugene or springfield. That being said I'm still happy.
Eastern Oregon  is 10x better than anything west of the cascades hall trying to take away our ducking fun rights and i have no problem being trans on the east side
That is how us washingtonians feel about our state as well!
This portlander who moved here from North Carolina I'm fear of LGBTQ rights being stripped away, also agrees!!
Bend, OR is an exception.
Don't go south of Eugene either
1,000x this - So long as you aren't in a couple of the rural pockets!  
Medicaid does HRT here, too!
Seconded, haven't had a single issue in-person at all. Only transphobes I encounter are online.
Safe but incredibly boring
We are pretty rad.
I just moved to CT from SC! Love it so much more so far 😢 😭
Love CT even though I'd much rather be in the mountains of Vermont! Stupid jobs just have to be all clustered down here where the skiing is just on little hills.
Stay out of SECT (especially New London County) if you make this move... Born and raised there.
I live in CT and I can agree
Honestly though
Our area code is 420 and the skunk is our state animal
mood
Hahahahaha! You and me both.
*Colorado

Everyday smoker here!
Saaaame
Seconded this. I moved from Texas to California 2 years ago and have never been happier. I'm not trans but I despise bigoted assholes and it was such a welcome change
Seconding California. It's reasonably safe and state law demands that your health insurance covers transition related medical care, including laser .
Another vote for California. If you can, I'd recommend sticking to the major cities. There are still some rural areas where you might not feel as safe, though.
One day I want to move back to the Bay Area. I miss it so much.
I'm hoping to go on E real soon, but I'm looking to get my own insurance but I don't know which one covers hair removal and estrogen. Or if I'll even be covered.
My family is gonna move out of California sometime in the future and I'm kinda worried. I'm not even in a very blue area, but it's still not that bad here at all. Idk where we're gonna be in Oregon but I don't have a great feeling about it regardless tbh
California sounds nice but shiiit how you guys affording that? Isn’t the housing/rental market crazy over there right now?
[removed]
I live in Texas…
Mmmmmmm, donuts😇
Yay Minnesota!
Don't stop right on the border though, gotta keep going to Minneapolis/St. Paul area. I mean, you can still stop for gas or snacks there if you need to, but I wouldn't recommend stopping for longer than that in Southern MN.
I want to live there.
Isn't it cold there?
I actually just recently started opening up more about my feelings and realizing that I was trans. And it all happened when I moved away from my family, from Wisconsin to Minnesota.
Ferndale straight up has gay/trans flags in the windows of every store. Pretty lit area.
Omg hii from jackson!
I'm Brazilian but I've visited Ann Arbor before! It was really cool and my first experience with a lot of snow!
Lansing's been pretty decent for me so far, too
Can confirm, am in one of those towns and support is good. Gender affirming care from the UofM medical system is also pretty good.
Michigan native as well; I would say that most of the state is at the very least safe for women (trans or cis) if not entirely friendly. I don't have much experience in the southern/ Detroit area but I love the northern and western parts of the state.
[deleted]
Escanaba here! Things are getting better up norf here as well.
Grand Rapids.... Mm. I've rarely felt unsafe for my life, but it's pretty religious. The farther you get out of the city center the more you'll get The Look. It's really starting to get to me
Port huron area is good, cheap housing/apartments, and certain services in the area are Wonderful.
I live in Ohio but I make treks to Michigan for a certain substance that isn’t legal in Ohio but is legal in Michigan😉 and I agree that ann arbor is a great place for trans people.
I second this. Especially with our legislature being supportive Democrats now that have already previously passed protections through executive action.
Winter as a trans girl is so nice because I can bundle up and pass easily
Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids on the west side too! Unfortunately, we're ships in a sea of red...
Michigan fucking blows
Best place in Canada would be montreal, quebec, Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Gatineau
Eastern Massachusetts is also good. I’ve been out and presenting for over a year (two weeks on HRT) and don’t remotely pass, but everyone has either been cool or quiet. Mass law explicitly defines gender identity as a protected class for work, housing, and public accommodations.
Yeah, I'm in Boston and it's good here.
I grew up in Western Mass, and MA overall is pretty accepting. I'd throw CT, VT, and RI into that too. Particularly the more urban areas.
My wife and I are moving to Western Mass from Texas in a few months!
I have lived in the South Shore all my life and I have never felt unsafe. Everyone I have met has been super supportive and have gone by a ""If it makes you happy, then go for it. I don't f-ing care"" moto.

 Also the access to HRT is very easy, especially if you live in an area connected by the Public transit as you can get to some of best Healthcare in US.
Pittsburgh is underrated. I'm guessing you've been to Central Outreach? \^\^
Berkeley, CA to 30 mins outside Olympia, WA here. Both are great. Much more to do in the Bay Area, but I’m loving the rural living now, and my primary doctor is an enby working in the tiny town 15 mins away.
I'm glad to hear Oly is trans friendly now. I had a friend who lived there about 10 years ago and swore up and down it harbored a far right community that hated and harrased lgbtq+ people. - OP, if you read this, I ammend my other comment that excluded Olympia WA.
I did NOT feel safe as a trans woman in Oakland. I was pretty early in my transition (still openly identifying as nonbinary), but I moved to Seattle. In Oakland I was being harassed almost every day.
Tucson is extremely welcoming to queer folks. I grew up there. [There are all sorts of resources available for the queer community.](https://gayarizona.com/tucson/resources/)
Arizona seems to be trending in our direction. I wouldn't call it a SAFE state overall since it's still Republican down ballot and could go right back to red overall if Republicans wise up and stop talking shit about John Mccain. But they are getting a Democratic governor.
Just as weird:  Salt Lake City.  Outside of SLC, though...well let me just say that when I've visited Utah for outdoor stuff, I stuff myself into a closet and present as my AGAB for reasons that are just as obvious in rural Utah as it is in rural Texas.

(Source:  A person who does a lot of hiking and backpacking and who knows just how far from the city limits of Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston you can go before...people don't like that you exist.)
Closeted AZ girl here and I would love to hear more any of y'alls experiences in the valley. I've been wondering if there was any sort of real community here.
Is Oregon pricey? Like I just need to live on the west side that’s fine but I’d love to live there, it’s much MUCH better than Oklahoma (anything except the south kinda is tho tbh.)

I’ve always wanted to live in the pnw but idk if I’ll ever make enough money to afford it
Honestly, if I could afford it, I would definitely leave the country in a heartbeat
Seattlite, can confirm.
Are there any places in the safe side of Washington that aren’t terribly pricey to live in? I want to move there so badly but I’m a teacher by trade so not the greatest income
And avoid Yelm. Every time I go there I am subject to trump posters and hats, plus the bumper stickers get real aggressive 🙄 a bunch of gun-loving idiots with no respect for their neighbor Native people.

Olympia/Tumwater/Lacey area is really nice tho!!
Sounds like I should move
My dream job is actually at a company that’s based in Bellevue, so I’d love to live in WA
I lived near the Temple campus and yea can agree. I love New Hope :)
> I always recommend New Hope. It's pricey but it's like Gay Central for us.

Luke, the best ally
There's some safe parts of Philly. Especially in center city where I've seen pride flags hanging from buildings lol.



Never been harassed or anything in Philly so far tho. One time the manager at checkout complimented me and the clothes I bought when I went shopping. There's good people here.
How is Pasco? There's a job there I might want, but only if I'm upgrading my family's safety.
Grew up in a rural town outside Spokane...

Can confirm.
I hate that I didn't get called a slur to my face until I went to France. Paris no less.
Omfg are you french ?
That’s where I live, but apparently the Republican Attorney General has tried to compile a list of all the people who have changed their gender marker on their drivers license in the past two years… and honestly at this rate that doesn’t sit well with me
I’m in the same area but unfortunately haven’t had your experience. I’m FtM so there may be some difference there though? Most doctors have been unkind to me unless I pass very well and I’ve been threatened on numerous occasions in the last year when I leave my home. I have also experienced sexual assault due to perceptions of my sexuality/gender and now that there are reproductive restrictions I am afraid to leave my apartment. I’m disabled anyway so it suits my accessibility needs and my fear to work from home, have groceries delivered, and conduct medical appointments remotely. I live in San Antonio and have all my life. I’m leaving as soon as I have the money saved up which will take me a little over 3 years at my income. 

I’d recommend anyone not linger here under the assumption that the urban areas looking purple rather than red on a map will afford more protections. Some older democrats are still “socially conservative”, there are some very conservative people still here, and city laws can’t easily defy state laws.
Hey now, Denton is pretty freaking kewl.

I can’t wait to get out if Texas tho’ :(
I was going to say the same, I'm in SA and have used both Planned Parenthood and the Kind Clinic and it's awesome. No social issues so far. (knock on wood)

This state government does scare the crap out of me though and I've started looking west.
The largest and most renowned medical center in the world is in Houston.
Just not anywhere in the middle.

Pittsburgh, Philly - OK

Pennsyltucky - very bad
Plus our electoral system keeps most of the fringe weirdos as fringe weirdos and not running the government.

It's actually hard to get elected when you need to convince an actual majority to vote for you, and not just more people than show up for the other guy.
Your very beautiful! B
Same! I wanna live in New York City so bad. I currently live in California.
In addition it's probably the best state for trans healthcare as it is for healthcare in general
Ottawa and Montreal are pretty welcoming too.  I have heard good things about Vancouver too (but the cost of living there is rough).
Agreed. Other parts of the state can vary, but mostly people even in rural areas won't actually bother you. Minneapolis is very actively trans-friendly in most places though. I've been living here for about five years, in the state my whole life but I don't particularly enjoy the rural areas anymore; although small-town people are honestly more likely to notice and care that I'm alternative than they will that I'm trans.
I'm visiting soon! Any must see spots for a tourist? And what's your favorite restaurant?
I've been really nostalgic for North Seattle lately. I lived in West Seattle, but as a baby through the end of kindergarten my grandparents lived in the very north part. Both of my parents were still working at the time so I was at my grandparents house a lot. Fun times. I still hang out with them a lot (we moved states about 6 years after they did to be near them again), but it's not the same. I miss being a little innocent kid who didn't have to deal with walking on eggshells around my parents.
Is there anywhere in the west side of Washington that’s affordable? I’m a teacher by trade so I couldn’t afford something like Seattle but I really want to move to the PNW very badly
Any recommendations for living in that area? I'm moving from Redmond a bit closer to Seattle for my commute.
I want to live in Bellevue. That’s where my dream job is
We’re currently considering a move to CO from WA so kids can be near grandparents. I last lived in CO pre transition/7 years ago and my cis friends back there are giving me mixed messaging about how welcoming places like Erie and Highlands Ranch will be. I know boulder and Denver are safe bets. Can you give me your opinion on HR and Erie for trans people?
I can confirm that Vermont is pretty good, if you don't mind the rural and the cold. Burlington in particular has a pretty thriving LGBTQIA+ scene, but any of our smaller cities should be pretty good to. It is mid-tier expensive though.

In addition to having a supportive government we've got good trans health care (at least in my experience). Should the need to flee the country arise we're also close AF to Canada.
If you live up around Burlington, Montreal is an hour’s drive north, very queer-friendly with a great nightlife/cultural scene.
I didn’t mean my verbiage to be exclusive. It was an honest mistake. I’d never want anyone to feel dysphoria at my expense
I don't think they were saying everyone here is a girl. They were asking the girls who are here for their opinions . . .
Me too!  Minneapolis…. Stay safe on the roads today!
As someone who’s in WA, I agree. And healthcare is legally forced to pay for gender affirming care which is 👌
Glad to hear that..
+1 for Maryland, and I've heard great things about RI
Did you forget? Trans guys don't exist on reddit.

(Sarcasm)
cringe
[removed]
I live in nc and I feel this so deeply lol. A guy literally stopped the other day walked backwards to look at me in a shoe isle the other day with another girl and just stood there I was mega creeped out. He didn’t say anything but he was absolutely brazen staring me up and down like he couldn’t quite put his finger on something and it bothered him. My wife’s car has been vandalized twice.  I’ve been called several names but never assaulted.  It sucks im ready to leave.
It was an honest mistake. I didn’t mean to offend anyone!
they were talking to trans girls specifically
this question is meant to get at the transfem experience. she is not lumping all trans people together as girls
Similarly, MD! Montgomery and Howard county are especially trans-friendly. My limited experience with Baltimore has been good too
Yes! Maryland doesn’t get as much recognition as it should for being LGBT+ friendly. It’s progressive, blue af, and Bmore is quirky and affordable.
Eyyy DMV. NoVA is solid as well, and DC is about as blue as it gets. The whole DC area is pretty queer.
I can't believe this is the only post about NJ and how low this comments is.

NJ has some of the oldest and best protections for trans rights in the US.
Is it?  We have an immigration case making the front page news here in Canada because an Irish trans kid is desperate to not get sent back to Ireland due to discrimination he experienced.  It really surprised me because I figured Ireland would be a more chill place about it than the UK.  Perhaps regional differences were at play?
It’s not about clocking for me… it’s our law makers trying to pass scary legislation that would make our existence basically illegal. And honestly I don’t really wanna stick around while they decide
Abbott tried to make a trans registry
I was in Boebert’s district for work. Got death threats daily. Would not recommend,
Would happily join you there!
This.
It’s the new boogeyman for a political party to use to rile up its base

Trans weren’t in the crosshairs prior, it was Moose-Lambs (Muslims) and Sharia Law, or before that it was the Caravan of MS-13 (Central America gang) of illegals coming to take our jobs and rape all the white women, and before that it was the gays and homosexuals trying to get your teenage sons to switch sides and suck dick, or before that was the middle class making too much and poor business needed to be unregulated, and before that it was the fucking hippies of peace and love, and before that it was the blacks and their civil rights… Why couldn’t we go back to gold old times of the ‘50’s where segregation, male dominance/patriarchy and white privilege run rampant.

Your just the new target, they’ll move onto their next target soon enough. Their base needs someone to hate on and despise, lesser being to be scared of that infringes on one of their values. If liberals tomorrow started marrying 3-4 wives and polygamy became the norm, within 1 election cycle (4 years) it would be blasted as the sanctity of marriage has been defiled with multiple wives, even though they would gain an enemy with the Mormons and Muslims again to a point, lol

Also someone on Reddit posted a well educated look beyond the rhetoric of why men do despise trans and all the different genders. If you’re male born at birth, why would you give away that privileged opportunity of access. Like patriarchy still holds certain values and is baked into many systems. Why transition or give away that access. Why put yourself into more trouble by alienating yourself by coming out and saying I despise being a man, when a man can and has those extra benefits. If you look into it, a lot has to do with Transwoman, never into many Transmen or Non-Binary or the whole spectrum on the gender people feel they rightfully belong in. It’s always Transwoman that create Transphobia. 

The thought a man transitioning themselves into the lesser sex, like giving up the golden goose. It just freaks them out and makes them think your attacking them by saying I saw what your type is and I’m switching sides. Most men are tribal in nature and try to sub-categorize themselves more until they find a bubble that fits their niche with other common folks, but when others do it that skews way too out of the normal bar range of thought for them, it becomes foreign and it becomes something to be expunged before it either pops their bubble or invades/attaches/joins in.

Hell you have Trans-Republicans, literally the political party that wants to end your existence and you want to represent that party, it’s like some weird death wish cult of enticement.


For me, OP is gorgeous, come to NYC and make us more beautiful, fuck Texas.
Texas here as well - we need a texas trans chat hehe
Sadly, it looks like NH isn't immune :/ I'm not sure if you've heard already, but an anti-trans legislative service request was brought forth (LSR 2023 0071). 

With NH's motto being what it is, I'd have really hoped and expected more inclusivity, but it seems like the state government is trending more conservative, which is really sad to see.

I've definitely heard more transphobic comments from my coworkers, recently, too, but that's a really small sample size. I've also definitely seen some chill people, too.
I’m all too aware of patterns unfortunately. The second I heard what he did I knew I couldn’t stay.
That’s exactly what I thought too
I’ve always felt colorado is really balanced although I don’t know a lot about our trans community here.
It’s less about that and more that i can’t afford to fully leave so i have to find the safest yet affordable option.
State?
Where a gay couple holding hands can pass by a mosque on Friday evening after prayers and no chaos ensues.

Is it perfect? Hell to the fuck No!, but sometimes the city is just perfect with everyone enjoying life and being good to each other.
Spokane is becoming quite friendly to LGBTQ folx, actually.
Yup ,  more population , higher the risk anytime..
Disagree on that last part. I’m moving to Springfield soon for work and it’s great.
I live in the Rio grande Valley, nothing serious would happen here but most people would probably make fun of you
Best of luck to you, and I wish 🤞 you well on your journey ❤️ wherever you decide to plant yourself, sweetie!!
I lived in so many different states and I’d argue Illinois is honestly great. The prices aren’t as steep but a lot of areas are really affirming.
Our government is trying to collect data on trans people living in Texas, and that’s just got me feeling very uneasy
I wish I were brave enough to stay and do that here… I just feel like it’s almost too far gone here and plus I’m a little tired of fighting to just exist in peace. I’d rather leave where I’m not wanted
The last major earthquake here was 2019 in Ridgecrest/Trona, CA. The one before that was so many years ago elsewhere. It’s far less often than the news says it is. :)
For some reason I completely forgot to add that our gender affirming care is OFF THE CHARTS GOOD and no matter what insurance you have they HAVE TO pay for your care. If you are broke enough (under a certain threshold) they will pay for EVERYTHING you will ever need in any area of healthcare—you won’t even have copays.
You’re incredibly sweet! I have my dad to thank for my lips ^~^ his are even bigger than mine lol
Georgian native here, can confirm. Atlanta, especially Midtown is a safe zone for anyone of the lgbtq+/trans communities. Anywhere else in the state and they'll target you quicker than anything else.
florida might have a big lgbt community but the politics and policies against lgbt people there are fucking terrifying
At like 19?
I mean if Hawaii is an OPTION then absolutely. But that just feels like a mad unicorn dream. You can't just...move to Hawaii. Not as like, a regular person who doesn't have millions of dollars. UHaul wouldn't rent me a truck for that.
That’s where I already live. I want to get out of Texas. Our lawmakers are doing some scary things and I don’t want to wait around to see how they play out.
Are you questioning my validity of being trans??
Especially cape cod
In what way and what part of Texas ? If I can ask .
FORGOT TO MENTION NYS COVERS A LOT OF TRANSITION COSTS
If I had friends or family there, I would do it in a heartbeat
To clarify I mean free as in people don’t stare. Nobody says anything under their breath. It’s not hard to get work. Cis People are so used to trans people we are almost boring to them. Hahaha. And to the moderators who wanted to take this post down for the OP saying “girls”. It’s should be well known that the violence towards trans women is more overt and extreme and accepted in a lot of places. Especially for those of us that date cis men.
❤️ OHP covers HRT ❤️
This portlander agrees.
WA also requires insurance to cover all sorts of things
I didn't know that WA covers E. I'll take notes for when I do get on E
Also Washington here, not fully out, but Seattle seems super welcoming and nice. Just don’t go east of the mountains or onto the peninsula lol
I live in Vancouver, and I've had nothing but positive interactions with people since I started transitioning
Came here to say Washington. Feels safe here. ❤️
It's better in that we have social safety nets. It's hard to go hungry or unsheltered for too long.
You mean Austin, not Texas
Moved up to Maine from CT, I too thought ct was cold haha.
Good thing you’ve got major cities in other states within relatively easy reach!
Yes we are ❤️
I’ve been here all my life. I love how pretty the seasons are and most people are super friendly 😁
I live in Israel this literally is my only solution
This portrait is utterly captivating.
[removed]
Stuck in Texas myself, we’re planning on moving to new mexico. It’s a blue state,  weather is nice, low allergies, cost of living in albuquerque isn’t bad, and still close enough that my wife can drive back to visit family. 👍
Kentucky is key
Seconding Minnesota if you can stand the cold, this snow is killing me
In California? Your gender affirming care will be covered no matter which insurance you go with. There are varying requirements for certain procedures like hair removal or surgeries (needing to be on hrt for a certain amount of time before starting laser, for example) but you can get an estradiol prescription very quickly and easily here with informed consent.
To call it crazy would be an understatement. I'm a software engineering manager and I can't afford to buy even a small home in the bay area. Most people here just rents apartments and spends a huge chunk of their paycheck on housing. It's 100% worth it, though, especially since it's becoming significantly less safe for trans people elsewhere in this country. I will probably never leave California.
mods can u pls ban this transphobic troll from this sub? thank u
u/DonQuixoteReference
u/-littlefang-
u/CedarWolf
I read that in Homer Simpson's voice.
I assume you're talking about Glam Doll Donuts. They have way over the top indulgences like brownie stuffed donuts with fudge on top.
Wow Caily!!! look at all your comments and up-votes!!
Yeah! Minnesota is pretty great 🥰
mini soda
Seconding St Paul/Minneapolis, I lived in Sioux Falls, South Dakota when I first came out, and while everyone there was super accepting of my transition, I don't think anyone really understood? They just accepted it because it's the right thing to do, but it felt so alien feeling like the only person like me. 

But when I moved to St Paul, I finally actually had friends like me?? Other trans people?? Actually Fargo North Dakota has a lot of trans people too, but that damn wind, ha
my bf is from Albert Lea, can confirm you gotta keep going north well past the border
Definitely the twin cities are the best. Though some of the other larger cities aren't bad either. My partner and I live in St. Cloud, and we have several friends like us in town. Most of our friends are in the cities though. It's our goal to move closer someday when we can afford it. But in the mean time, the cost of living is much lower here.
depends on your definition of cold. you get used to the winter, and the summers are hot.

I highly recommend Minnesota.
Put on a sweater, put a hotdish in the crockpot. Make a pot of Caribou coffee. You'll be fine. It's actually pretty nice out. If it's warm enough to snow, it can't be that bad. You won't like it when it gets too cold to snow. No one does. On the other hand, I like it more than Gov. Abbott, and you can get cute winter gear! If you have the right gear and dress in layers appropriately for the weather, it can be a lot of fun. Today I shoveled snow and actually got too hot in a fleece jacket. If you're active, you'd be amazed at how cold it can be but you're toasty warm in layers of fleece and smartwool etc. The houses here have good climate control and insulation so if you're more of a Great Indoors person, just crank the furnace and pretend you're in Old El Paso or whatever, I guess. lol
yesssireeee. next week we have a high of 1°F :D
Ferndale is GREAT.   I kinda wish we had bought our house there, but I love our little microfarm.
Oh awesome!  We are in Belleville!
It's a great city!
I'm going to visit Lansing in the spring.  We've heard it's a cool town, and my dad went to Michigan State.   I've technically been there, but I was like 7 and only remember going to a comic book store.  Lol
Hey Lansing!
I get my hormones, and all my medical care.  Talking to other veterans, not only is it one of the best VA hospitals in the country, it is flst out the best for transfolk and gender affirming care.

  Like, the moment I told my doc I was trans and wanted to transition, he swivelled his chair to his computer.  I was like ""what are you doing?""  ""Have you picked a new name?  I can add it in the spot for what you want to be called, so the staff can address you properly.""   

The staff are also great for not outting you.  When they call your name, they say ""veteran <last name>"", but when you're actually in their office they use you chosen name.  They also have a ton of experience with transfolk in general.  

Oh, and the lgbt advocate is basically a dragon.
Greater Detroit area is overall one of the safest places we have ever lived.  I love western and northern Michigan.
That is very gratifying to hear.  I'm getting more comfortable going out presenting, even in our semi rural area.
That's frankly, very awesome!
I know, right?
We live in the countryside just outside the Ypsi/Ann Arbor area.  Basically, we live where the pride flags stop and the Trump flags start.  

Neighbors are gonna love us next year when we plant a flower garden in transpride colors.  😁
I have to give props to Alberta, even though it’s the “Texas of Canada” I walked into the registry office and updated my gender marker on my drivers license and health card for like $15. Now I never get misgendered at the doctors office and my ID reflects who I really am. I have sometimes felt unsafe, but only during Stampede, which brings all the d-bags to the yard.
Honestly, Nova Scotia isn't so bad. There are more hicks there compared to where you mentioned, but people mind their own business. It's such a secluded province.
I said what I said, but if you are looking for a legit city, then refer to sky_is_the_nexr_pewd's comment xD my previous comment is for anyone looking for a slowed safe space. Super slow. Like, unbearable slow.... just go to Montreal.
[deleted]
Eh +1 to Vancouver. It's a super comfy city albeit a little expensive. But what big city isn't.
whereabouts are you? im from the south shore and that's definitely not my impression from being here 🙃

northeast i could see,, boston is ick in general but probably not too bad
Just in time for mud season! It gets seriously muddy out in Western Mass in late winter/early spring lol, I grew up in the Berkshires.
Central is great. And only one of many queer community health center
No there are 100% nazis. 
I am sorry. It's so normalized in my brain from living on the west coast and spending a lot of time in rural areas. 
In my experience the nazis have been FAR less dangerous than average Joe's in texas. 
Olympia has a huge community of (largely white) gender queer and trans folks. Its really special. I went into straight culture shock when I moved.
I’d feel safe in Flagstaff and Tucson…maybe Sedona.  Outside of that, no.  AZ has a deep vein of hate and righteous conservatism mixed with way too lax gun policies for my taste.
I left long ago.

If you can, turn your eye toward Tucson.  There’s great community there.
Compared to Florida and Chicago it is way cheaper but housing like everywhere else is he biggest expense. I'm in Klamath Falls and have a nice house for under $1200 a month. Rent might be a bit more. Just gotta know where to look, really populated spots on the cost or in the mountains are pricey. Shoot high desert. 

No sales tax and a single adult is $200 a month in groceries.

Utilities are hella cheap like $100-200  a month

Gas is expensive 🫰 but where isn't it?

The culture is great though, like I live in a relatively conservative small desert town farm lands 😬 but after a month here I started seeing all the members of the community (mainly from the local colleges I think) and then I started expressing myself more out while shopping (wearing skirts/makeup etc.). I was surprised to get complements and no mean stares or insults etc.

The nature is beautiful and the weather is all season goodness. 

It's not very racially diverse because of laws at it's founding that had a trickle down effect. Something that is changing for the better but is obvious and easily researchable.

Free medical care including surgeries 🤷‍♀️ you'll have to wait two years from starting the process to getting under knife but still. 

Been democratic heavily for many many years ✌️💅
Yes it is pricey.

Good luck
I live in one of the shitty parts of Portland but I have a 600 square foot 1-bedroom apartment all to myself for $705/month. That's basically as cheap as you can possibly get for non-shared housing here without Section 8 subsidies, and it's REALLLLLLY rare to find something at this price, but it's not impossible.

Cost of living otherwise isn't terrible thanks to the lack of sales tax, and our state-provided healthcare (OHP) is amazing for gender-affirming care. If you don't mind roommates and can take advantage of our social welfare programs, it's definitely doable, and there's TONS of jobs in kitchens or the service industry that pay decently.
Honestly I don't blame you. USA is a scam. Just one big scam in almost everything.

On a side note, If you ever do get out of the US, England, Canada and Australia are all amazing English speaking countries that are very progressive. Not sure which cities in Australia, canasta I believe Toronto was mentioned by a lot of people. In England I'd definitely recommend Brighton or Cambridge.
The further you live from Seattle or Tacoma, generally the more affordable it's going to get. There's some very affordable small towns to the south of Tacoma, as well as sprinkled in to the east of those two cities. It's never going to be as cheap as the midwest though 😭
Yeah that's what I meant by parts of Philly not being safe just in general. Some are, but some aren't. I only have been to a few spots, and excluding almost getting hit by cars all the time when I'm walking, I don't feel comfortable in the city thanks to someone following me with his car and demanding my number and not leaving me alone until I did. It was near the East Falls apartments so, that area I wouldn't call safe honestly for me.

I mean I hate cities in general so I'm biased lol no free parking that's convenient and what not.
Anything east of the cascades is a no go for me personally. And I can’t speak to how Pasco is myself
I know right. Guess why I’m still wearing a mask while it’s been off since more than a year
:( that sucks.
Omfg yes !
I just reposted that on social media, it’s so f’ing wrong and we need to get the word out.  It’s like Nazi germanys action before the holocaust.  Dam pisses me off
That’s called “data mining” and it’s unethical.  And, in some places it’s against the law.
That scares me too. If things continue to go how I fear they’re going, this place won’t be safe in a few years. Time to buy guns and renew passports I think. You can never be too safe
New Orleans has a huge trans and lgbt community- one of the queerest cities in the country. They’res it’s own share of problems but I feel safe going out with friends
Yeah when I read that I was like this feels very…Nazi germany.
Gender? I 'ardly know 'er!
Ken Paxton is a total POS
I'm so sorry on behalf of all decent people that all of that has happened to you, on top of that, fear from the reproductive restrictions. Situations like yours make me so sad and scared for all of us...
Really feels like we are going backwards as a society and moving towards some very dark places.
Just know for all the bad there's a lot of good and us good will continue to fight for what's right. Or not right, in this instance 😅
I grew up in sa too. If you need help with finding good healthcare, there’s a place called the kind clinic near the airport that provides high quality trans healthcare for free if you can’t afford it. Fr bro, you should definitely look into it because that shit saved me life
Denton proper yes, but the rest of Denton county has enough red to keep any real change from happening. Especially now that they gerrymandered the ever living shit out of it. I'm a white CIS male and the way this state is headed has me scared. I can't imagine how others must feel. Part of me really wants to leave to get my kids away from it, but part of me also thinks that's exactly what they want. The only thing that gave me any hope was Tarrant county going for Biden. Makes me hopefully we'll eventually flip Denton county blue.
This is the truth.. Lancaster county isn’t too bad though
Yeah I have family in Rural Mn and haven’t had much issues with the exception of a few extended family members who found out speaking up against me while in front of me wasn’t smart.  And even when I was newly out and early in my transition, the general reaction to me was amazing support.
Awesome!   My favorite restaurant is Billy Sushi!  My gosh it’s the best sushi I’ve ever had and I travel a lot!   Lots of cool restaurants and bars downtown, stick to North Loop and any place there is awesome really.  Oh!  Hells Kitchen is awesome too…. I’m not up on clubs but love a good brewery and cider house.  If those are your vibes, then there are many to pick from here.  

Hope you have a good time and enjoy the visit!
Oh and dress warm!
I am a teacher.  What grades do you teach?  My district has some of the most competitive payrates in Western Washington.  Not to mention having a pretty good equity policy for transgender employees.
Erie should be fine, I think. These days, there are a lot of people there who would like to live in Boulder but can't afford to live any closer. I don't feel worried about my safety when visiting there. Though I would caution that the eastern half of Erie is in Weld County, so if you need anything from the county government or you get called for jury duty, you would have to go up to Greeley, where I would NOT feel safe. If you were to move to Erie, look for a place west of County Line road, so that you are in Boulder County.  


I never really go down to Highlands Ranch, so I'm not sure. The one person I know offhand who used to live in Highlands Ranch is a cis lesbian, so I could at least ask her about it from that perspective.
sadly i live in york county but i’ve always wanted to check out Montreal i might have to take a vacation or something there once
I follow you on insta! @maddieisenough
lol I refuse to be banished to Tumblr
yeah I can't see any evidence of that but whatever you say mate
I figured. I just wanted to let you know for future reference. Thanks for understanding :)
There’s still transmen and non-binary people on this subreddit and scrolling just to be hit with YOU GIRL does not feel good. Even if I know it’s not intentional it still feels bad.
Why though? Trans men are in the same boat on the registry.
[deleted]
Like I live i the middle of the country side full of farmers and a lot of people who still catholic and go to church just not care that I am trans like in my school the most dodgy person in my year came up to me in the hall way and just said did you change your name I said yea it’s Mia and he just went sound Mia and went on his way
It is definitely more chill than the uk it just depends what part you go to like up the north definitely but where I’m living county Wicklow it’s chill people just generally don’t care that I am trans
Go to Washington frfr
Fr fr
We can hope it doesn’t go through, I remember seeing a poll a while back that showed a large majority of people in NH support trans people and anti trans laws have been proposed before but they’ve never gotten through. I hope I’m not going to need to move away from my family when I become an adult due to this crap.
I used to be part of the Colorado Springs trans community until I was accused of not being trans and actually being a serial killer by a trans person. I now live in Denver I don’t have any problems being trans here.  If not for my major depressive disorder, and my general hatred of groups of people I would probably know more about our community too
Exactly! Also i love your username
To be fair the only people i know that live in spokane is my dad's family who lean way too far into maga territory.
Oh nice! I'm glad to hear that not everywhere outside of the immediate city is so... like that lol. I was freaking out over the summer when I went to the bison sanctuary, and there was a ""patriot's protest"" with AR-15s promoting Trump 2024 and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric
Oh yeah - that sounds like some Brown Shirt stuff right there.
I was actually in Napa the day after that one in 2014 to start a job 😬😬 regardless— your state is beautiful but too expensive for me and your drivers stress meTF out lol
AND FFS!! And may even start covering hair removal in the next few years!
Waaaaaiiiiit what is this? I just moved to Portland in the fall and am signing up for new medical coverage in the new year. Would love to see if I could get my transition covered :D
A few years ago a friend of mine got top surgery and it was covered by OHP.
And bottom surgery, and top surgery...
This Portlander also agrees.
Washington State Health Care covers all sorts of transgender related health care issues. From surgery, hair removal, and transportation and lodging costs
Prescriptions can be had for less than insurance copay using an app like GoodRX that essentially provides coupon codes to pharmacies for people that don't have insurance.  I never had a problem in Washington and I loved the light rail because driving in Seattle was a nightmare for me and the gayborhood (cap hill) is fantastic. The Puget Sound just got expensive AF to live in, even in south King co.
From what I've heard they can cover all gender-affirming care, though I haven't directly looked into anything but the hormones
Yeah, I live on the east side in basically a little island and while it's good here the second you leave city limits at all goes downhill lol
How much more supportive is West Oregon tho?  Like I've found a decent amount of supportive people here in Boise but a lot of people stare you down for wearing earrings that aren't even particularly fem
I don't understand your point/question as to any state modeling itself after any city

I have relatives living in many parts of both Oregon and Texas, and I can most assuredly and positively say the state of Texas from my original statement!
The dictatorship that genocides Palestinians is where you feel the safest???? How fucked up is the USA?? Damn
You aside from being a trans person living in a state being ruled by a governor and attorney general infected by the anti trans mind virus who constantly attack trans and other lgbtq folks in an attempt to stoke anti queer moral panic for the sake of their own fucked up careers? I dunno, maybe she wants a power grid that won't get knocked out in the winter when it's too cold... OR WHEN THE SUMMER'S TOO HOT. Seriously Texas, wtf 🙄
Yee I live in Socal. I'm on my mom's Medicaid but I'm not sure if that won't cover it. And isn't hrt and getting on estradiol the same thing? Sorry I'm just new to this.
It’s crazy that it’s come to this. Like one of the few places it’s cool to live you have to fork over such significant percent of your earnings, just so you can have a roof over your head?! Madness
On it. Thanks!
In that case you nailed the landing😀!!
Oooh glam doll is amazing! Youve gotta try Bogarts as well, they have simple donuts but theyre fantastic too
I miss boggarts and glam doll! Lizzo shot one of her old music videos inside of the glam doll on eat street.
It’s pop
How do you find these other trans people around St Paul?
Yeah, that's where I grew up too.
Overall that sounds kinda nice. Winter clothes are cool and I like hot drinks!

Although I've been in Antarctica at -15 (during their summer of course) and it still snows then, and I know it still snows there at -60, although it's more like flying ice at that point.
You don't put a hotdish in a crock pot wtf.
1°F is equivalent to -17°C, which is 255K.
---
^(I'm a bot that converts temperature between two units humans can understand, then convert it to Kelvin for bots and physicists to understand)
It would be a really nice place to live. Always figured I'd end up there at some point when I can afford it. One day.
I did have to talk to a Trump supporter though lmao
Go there for Drs appointments all the time - stop at Good Truckin Diner for breakfast or lunch. Best food ever, super cute diner, very LGBT+ affirming. The little art district it's in is super cute too.
That's awesome.  I didn't even think about the VA hospital here because I'm technically employed by the university, and my time in service was so short I don't really consider myself as a veteran (mostly out of respect for the people who did more than blow out a knee in BMT).
Wouldn’t recommend visiting Dearborn though. I’m not out yet but a large majority of the people there are extremely transphobic. Have met a couple friends but it’s not the best position to be in
That's a beautiful area, but it's too bad about the trumpies. Good luck and stay safe!
(just to clarify for Americans, easily changing your sex in your ID is a country wide thing, not just Alberta)
I'm glad you have proper gender on your license! I know it makes a HUGE deal
I’ve been to Nova Scotia before, nice place. Did have an incident of street harassment though where some pudgy hick yelled at me that I should be ashamed of myself and disgraced from across the road while not stopping. Eh, always gotta be one ass, hey?
[deleted]
I've leaved most of my life in quebec city and it's like one of the safest place for us same with montreal
I’m kinda between Boston and Providence. The town was pretty Trumpy for Massachusetts, but I haven’t had any problems in this area. 

I work downtown (right by South Station) and haven’t had any issues going to restaurants in that area for lunch either.
I'm in Phoenix area (Gilbert specifically) and I overall feel safe. Definitely planning on moving out of the east valley, but good chunks of the central valley are welcoming. Roosevelt, Arcadia, Tempe, and Melrose neighborhoods, in particular if you've got the money for them. Hell, my fiancee teaches music lessons in Scottsdale as visibly queer, and so far none of the parents have said anything directly to her (a couple have complained about 'morals' and have been told they can withdraw their kids)

I do have a firearm in the house, but that's more for if my dad shows up than my neighbors (even though they are Mormon).
Damn that’s cheap af compared to LA. I’m actually visiting portland next week to see if i like it lol
Oh this sounds LOVELY. My rent here is $840 a month on a teachers salary (they pay miserly here) so I think Oregon may very well be doable :)))
Isn't England infested by transphobic second wave feminists (aka TERFS)?

Australia is where I want to go. They seem more laid back culturally, have federal discrimination protections, and a mandatory ranked choice voting system that mostly neuters any right wing populism that's been such a problem in the first world lately.
Anything is better than Okla-fucking-homa
Aw okay. Well maybe I'll need to visit first to check things out.
Not so much data mining since he just had his office call the dps and ask for anybody who changed sex markers on any documents. Paxton doesn't really pay so much attention to whats legal in any case, hence the still pending indictment from 2015.
Sadly I'm in Oklahoma and I'm about to go buy something for self defense too. I personally strongly dislike guns but I dislike being unsafe more.
It could be unsafe for trans youth (doctors and parents too) as soon as the end of this August (September as written in the submitted legislation, august is earliest by Texas law). It really depends on what happens in this next legislative session (starts 1/10/2023, latest they can submit a bill for consideration in the 88R session is 3/10, so we may not know all the planned legislation until then).

Families with trans youth need to be in the process of moving right now. Keep an eye out for families in your sphere of influence and help out in what ways you can.
As a queer person who grew up in New Orleans, you couldn't pay me enough to have me move back there.
I’ve legit never heard of the kind clinic so I greatly appreciate the reference. I’ve always been pointed to Planned Parenthood but with the recent laws using them has a higher legal risk (mostly because people are idiots) until I get rid of a few organs. I’ve been using my primary care doctor (TailoredMD) to get my hormones. She admittedly doesn’t know a lot about trans healthcare or issues but is more than happy to order my T and blood tests and knows where I should be testing at for T levels. I will check out the kind clinic though to be able to work with someone that can answer some more of my questions (especially after my recent labs revealed I may be intersex). I wanted to go with Folx but couldn’t afford it 😅
Haha yeah my buddy who I'm going to visit has tried to get me into that mood. 


I'm looking forward to it though! Seems like a fun place in the winter.
I actually teach band/music classes!
Was just about to say this. Pretty sure it’s in the rules too
Annapolis is kinda hit or miss imo, the city itself is fine but very small and the surrounding community is pretty rural. The navy boys there are very thirsty I hear, though... I'm a lesbian, but I hear things lol! Over here in PG county it's not too bad, no real support from the county but there's a lot of queer folk here. I've never had trouble with anyone, though, it's really a mind your own business and everyone else will mind theirs kinda place. No queer bars or clubs, though. In contrast, I've had one or two bad experiences in DC, but that comes with being an urban center in general, I think.
I’m glad to hear that.  We’re used to getting queer refugees but they are not usually from Western countries.  I was kind of confused when I heard Ireland (I had previously heard it was pretty good).  Guess the kid was in a particularly intolerant area or something.  Good to hear you are well.
That’s good to know! Thanks for telling me that, that makes me feel a little better. 

Fingers crossed it’ll go away like the others. I’m the same, I don’t really want to have to move.
Thankies! ❤️
There’s no lack of MAGA, for sure.  But, there’s a purpling afoot.  I’ve got a handful of queer friends who are happy and thriving and finding community there.
Oh I just knew about the one in ridgecrest because I live so close to it. We definitely felt that. 7.1 friggin earthquake 🙄 lol
We have health insurance if your company doesn’t offer it/you can’t afford what your company offers. AFAIK it’s free if you’re low income, you just have to sign up for it once a year. https://healthcare.oregon.gov/Pages/types-of-coverage.aspx
my top surgery is being covered by OHP!
This Portlander also agrees.
Yes, poor wording on my part! Washington requires the insurance companies, to cover lots of care related issues!
I’m sorry it does fucking what now? I was shocked that all of my injection stuff was covered (i moved from Cali where injections weren’t covered fully) can you dm me a list of places. I’ve been too busy to reach out to the insurance provider to be annoyed and get the info xD
Everywhere is expensive but a spare hour or 2 here covers all my Rx costs, where in a ""cheaper"" state itd be an entire day's wage not even considering some of the best coverage and protections in the world
Well, now I know that my parents lied to my face. I didn't think they would go that far.
I mean it’s still better than that lunatic asylum known as Idaho (more specifically that spit of land between us and Montana lol)
Probably the best this country has to offer. The drag scene was popping off a decade ago when I lived there. I don't want to make it sound like a utopia, but it's not even remotely like what I hear about in red states. I can feel comfortable as myself most times and places, but it's also not perfect. We still have like Facebook and shit.
Very fucked up
Both are settler colonial states. Can't really expect life to be great for minorities in either place, especially since Israel is a puppet state of the US, who are explicitly transphobic in most places... Not to even touch their treatment of every other minority in history, starting with the Indigenous Americans.
why did this get downvoted lmfao
Israel is a lot of things but its not a dictatorship lmao, we have a democratic system that almost works too well for its own good
that... is the opposite of what they said. They said that because they live in Israel, they are forced to resort to being always high. That would imply that Israel is a very bad place for trans people to live... assuming the original commenter is trans.
No worries! Yes everything will be covered by your insurance. Just talk to your doctor about getting on hrt and they will refer you to an endocrinologist and possibly a psychiatrist to get the process started. You can start in a matter of weeks, or even sooner.
omg that was so quick thanks so much! 😊
Yaaaassss. Bogart's French Culler donut things are amazing.
See, America? Minnesota IS cool!
Honestly, lately, I have no idea, haha. I haven't really gotten out much at all since the pandemic, since my partner is immunocompromised, but I know the Queer Exchange Facebook group for the Twin Cities is pretty good, or at least used to be, I'm not really social enough to be in Facebook groups these days, but I remember it being pretty good before.

Otherwise, I mean, I'm in St Paul, you could just DM me :P
Sure you absolutely can. Source: My mom said it was okay. Crockpots are awesome and hotdishes are highly individualistic. You do you. I like smelling it cook all day while I WFH.
Good bot.
Ferndale isn't terrible expensive, so perhaps!
Yeah, there plenty, especially outside the cities.
Hey, you do have the benefits.  :)  I resisted for years and I did two tours of Iraq as infantry.
Yeah, I drove through Dearborn this morning.  Ferndale and Royal Oak are good, so is Ypsi and Ann Arbor.
Thanks, and you too!  We will do our best!
Oh cool. I didn’t know that! Oh Canada 🇨🇦🥰
No, you 100% get it lol the maritimes are lax. I lived in Houston for half a year and I honestly miss it. Other than rush hour, it was always on the go and there was so much to see. Ngl I also miss the tacos like crazy. Gonna have an ADHD moment because I heard Montreal has all you can eat tacos!! So, that's good enough for me, mhm.
I'm actually currently looking at apartments, so maybe I'll check around there. Thanks!
East valley (or far west) is a hard no, for me.  Maybe in the gayborhoods, but…I grew up in the valley and I hate the fucking heat!  So, AZ is solely for vacations for me :)
NGL, the city's culture has a long way to go to recover from the pandemic--it's still a shadow of its former self, and a lot of what I loved about this city may not ever come back. But communities are starting to recover and things are starting to seem like they're improving a little--I'm actually starting to feel a touch of optimism! 

I hope you enjoy your visit!
Australia is definitely the better option. England is... Complicated. London is very bad. Manchester and Liverpool are both essentially just slums and no one there likes anyone. Its not that theyre terfs, more that they hate everyone and everything and will find a reason for it.

England definitely depends on the city you go to. Alot of it can be extremely transphobic, but then again Brighton is considered as one of the most progressive cities in Europe, and Cambridge is definitely up there.

To be honest I've never actually come across a major transphobe here. Most people don't give a shit about anything in England.

That said, Australia is for sure better. Go to Australia.
Oh 100% early adolescence was hell. I love it in my 20’s. Theirs nothing really for younger queers to do but the night life is absolutely incredible- I’m from a smaller town in Louisiana recently moved to Nola tho so my experience is probably different than yours
If you are staying in Minneapolis there is a park that has tons of beautiful trails, winter hiking or snow shoeing, or even better yet, fat biking.  Theodore Wirth is the name.  Near that park I’d a Brewery called Utepils.  I love that place!
We have tons of music going on. Every elementary has general music, and secondary schools have band, orchestra, choir, and general music. DM me if you'd like some more information.
Can I ask you how Is Canada for trans people sometimes I hear it’s really good then other times it’s bad
Oooo this is so cool! I don’t think I’d qualify and I’m self employed so i have to get my healthcare through the marketplace, but I’m really glad this exists!
That's awesome, congratulations!
The Everett Clinic, Planned Parenthood, Pretty much every doctor once you have a therapist letter with an affirming diagnosis of gender dysphoria you can get your estrogen or testosterone depending on whom you are here in Washington State. You do have to have the health care provider card first from DSHS.
It's always been no more than $10 per prescription cash price a month for HRT without insurance with group codes anywhere I've had to fill a prescription if I was between coverage.  It's a great option for people who don't have insurance.

Looking right now within a 10 mile radius, it's $3.45 for a month of spiro at Costco and $9.99 for E at HEB.  My insurance copay starts at $10 for genetics.
Well, the law governing that was only passed at the start of this year, so it's fairly recent
I believe indigeneous Americans didn't believe in land ownership, which is mighty proper if you ask me. Ownership and greed are Christian Western values, just as Jesus preached them.
yeah well it does have an appartheid state in place. I don't see how a trans person feels safe in an openly fascist country
Because the person they’re replying to clearly doesn’t feel safe there and feels the need to be high just to accept living there, and yet some illiterate typed before reading their comment.
Maybe cuz they said it a bit harshly? Maybe cuz they implied the U.S is less fucked up than Israel, which is ludicrous? I’m not being snide btw I’m genuinely just spitballing
I mean. usa is not better. but they don't genocide inside their boarder. they do it aboard
Because they said it as if the person they were responding to said they feel safe(st) where they live, as if they have a choice. Some of us just don’t have a choice, when they clearly said living in a “State of constant high…is [their] only solution.”
A democracy of the settlers, maybe.
I am trans, why would you doubt that?
Why do you always have to take shit into politics?!
It's not about you

I feel safer in Israel than in America by a long shot, don't compliment yourself
It's not europe
My transition is subsidized and included in the healthcare package
Surgeries too (wait time is ludicrous cause there's like 4 plastic surgeons)
I'm glad I don't live in Palestine cause otherwise they'd tie me to a bike and drag me around until I'm a red stain
I'm glad I don't live in America cause heck I'd get shot even before I come out probably
I can be open about myself
I walk around in dresses and people compliment me

It's rough here because some people may disagree with the lifestyle
I was attacked for it before, but people help
It's rough here cause I got no money
It's rough here cause we had 6 elections in 3 years and this stupid country can't form a functional coalition
I live in a hugely expensive apartment, it literally falls apart on me in my sleep
There's probably asbestos cause it was built in the 60's
And whenever there's a missile attack from gaza we see it from the living room window and there's no bomb shelter
Also I got no money for food but am still fat

I come here cause I trans and I need support cause local community is shit
All politics, no help, no friendliness
But honestly, it's the same here
The only influence America has on Israel is that it ruins everything with it's Twitterish behavior

@keyboardsare4coding?
More like @keyboardsare4beingadumbasskeyboardwarrior
Oh my god thanks for the advice! I'll see what I can do to get things started : ))) I'll probably still think of switching out of my moms insurance and getting my own tho but thank you!
No worries! =\^.\^=
That's just a crockpot meal.
I live here, it's really lovely
It just feels weird when I was in service for all of 7.5 weeks and didn't even complete basic.  I feel like the resources that would get used for me would be better off going to someone who doesn't have other means and really needs it.
Fair enough, I've got arthritis and moved here from New England, so the heat is a positive for me. Right now with it being in the fifties my hands are acting up a little, but I can still use them.
Ty :) im just going in w no expectations. Ive been to Portland several times in my life but i was always just passing through quickly.
Ok thanks!
Fair question.  Overall, it’s quite good but it is a huge country with a lot of regional variations.  The bigger cities, especially in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia (think Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa) are particularly accepting.  Small rural communities in the western prairies or the mountainous interior of BC are probably the most conservative and culturally akin to the US places in the country and I have seen mixed comments (some describe acceptance or at least tolerance but others less so).  I live in a progressive city of about 1.5 million people and mostly get a mix of indifference and positivity.  Canadians are very live and let live.

Access to trans healthcare is a bit slower than the US but we have a consent based HRT setup and access to care has less gatekeeping than what most Europeans describe online.  The system has been a bit overwhelmed post-pandemic since isolation cracked a lot of eggs.
Oh yeah I’m on the drip already (lol) I more meant for all the other stuff - I also don’t have a therapist letter. Started as informed consent at PP in So Cal and continues up here

>I believe indigeneous Americans didn't believe in land ownership, which is mighty proper if you ask me.

This kind of thinking is done by good intentioned people but is no better than ""The White Man's Burden"". It even has a name, ""The Noble Savage"". Look into it if you're interested. It's harmful for a couple reasons. 

The main reason this line of thinking is harmful is that you are painting **hundreds** of native American tribes with a single brush. Tribes that lived in geographical areas as different as someone living in Russia would be to someone living in the middle east. There were some tribes who act as you said. There were also violent warmongering tribes, and cannibalistic tribes. Keep in mind I mean this in the nicest way, but it is an incredibly gross generalization, even if it's a positive one.

The second and more minor reason is that you operate under the assumption that since Europeans were bad, and Europeans had a relationship with indigenous people that was... Tenuous at best, that must mean the indigenous people were good. It's contrarianism. If you disagree with this point though just focus on the first one.

Once again, I mean all of this in as nice a way as I can. But don't fall into the trap of ""The Noble Savage"".
I mean honestly, the whole world is a pretty fucked up place if you get nitty gritty about it. Once you stop giving a damn about societal norms and expectations, it just becomes more and more clear how jacked up some of the world is compared to the rest..
Anyone who has israeli citizenship can vote in Israeli elections. Kind of like every other democratic country in the world. Eligible voters include the ~20% of the population that is Muslim, and there are prominent Arab parties in the parliament, which form coalitions with ruling parties and form governments. As I said, the democracy works almost too well, because literally nothing ever gets done and every time there is any instability, the government falls apart and a new one has to be formed. Everyone who is a citizen gets a vote, kind of the whole thing with democratic systems. You can definitely argue about who and who shouldn't be citizens but the elections are free and fair, and I'd probably agree with you, but as it is, it is absolutely a democracy. As for the ""settlers"", that is a small portion of the population (which is growing due to government subsidies, which  is something that i am extremely vocal in my opposition to, I believe all israeli settlements in the west bank should be withdrawn today). The majority of israeli citizens live on land which is internationally recognized israeli and they are allowed to vote, regardless of demographic distinction.
Wait hold on. I didn't doubt anything about you! I just said I didn't know because I knew nothing about you whatsoever. I'm sorry I misinterpreted what you meant, but you have to admit that ""I live in Israel this is literally my only solution"" is not a really great endorsement of the trans experience in that country. 

I did not mention the US, I did not mention Palestine, and I did not mention politics at all? Are you confusing me with /u/KeyboardsAre4Coding? I am /u/oskis_little_kitten. It really feels like you are talking to the wrong person.I disagreed with their bullshit too.
I’m only one town over in Royal Oak!
You still damaged your body, and you only get one of those, in military service.
Well for other stuff you will need a therapist letter for any surgeries you may want. I know it sounds like a bunch of hoops to jump through, but once it is done you can move forward pretty quickly
Enlighting, I'll do some research into it. Perhaps I should have been more specific in my statement, I find the concept of tribes or groups not having the concept of land ownership interesting. Thanks for the information.
Yea nations r bad. And I hope after the coming climate apocalypse the last surviving humans realize that and do anarchism. I’m an optimist really
28 UN member states do not recognize Israel. Many more do so only out of necessity. The indigenous population, much of which has been expelled with no right to return, has no viable pathway to Israeli citizenship. I doubt that the present-day victims of the ongoing genocide would agree that “nothing gets done” in Israel. Schools get bulldozed, families get evicted, and children are murdered. It’s an apartheid state that only survives as a result of continued Western interference in the region. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.
I have seen the police grabbing people and pulling the out of their home so a settler can go and move in it. How you can say this is a democracy in any way????
It's for all y'all
Royal oak is so lovely! It's pretty during the winter with the lights and all that. I live right by the Zoo, so being able to walk there is lovely.
Yeah, and I do get a monthly stipend, so I'm not exactly getting nothing out of the deal.
Hmmm! I thought there was an end around with time spent on HRT. I was banking on that still, as it’s what I read in Cali but things can definitely be different. Do you mind chatting in DM you seem to know the area and I would rather not publicly dox my city
No problem friend, I figured you might not mean it literally but thought I'd respond just in case
Okay but, why are you mad at me? All I did was say that you clearly don't 100% love living in Israel, which your own post history indicates is true...
Royal oak has a lot of really good bars and restaurants! It’s great for food but not as progressive as Ferndale. I have way more neighbors with 20 Trump flags on their lawn than I would have expected from how the area is
Sure let me set up my settings so you can message me
Ready whenever you are
Nah less you...  you're ok I just joined and I kinda looking for q trans group I can chill in and I'm defensive

I have a question, if someone is a trans male then does that mean they were a woman that transformed into a man or they were a man that transformed into a woman?
>assuming this, you managed to get on hrt within 6 months of being out

what in the fucking fuck what
You are really pretty!
Congratulations. I hope you find nithing but happiness.

I'll take that as a compliment 🙂 I'm wearing Nars natural radiant foundation
Good angles and lighting help, also, many of us don't see ourselves the way others do.
I just looked at your profile and you're cute af, there's definitely changes :) I think we find it hard to see because we see ourselves so often that we don't notice the small gradual changes
Tell me you're repressed without telling me your repressed.

It's ok sweetie, you'll get there one day 😋
It is up to transphobes to be honest and upfront, not force us to out ourselves unless we want to , when being outed can lead to direct discrimination and violence, up to and including murder.
What do you mean? 🙊
OP accidentally replied as a top level comment. This is what OP said 

> Hii, a trans man is a person who identifies as a man but was assigned female at birth and a trans woman is the opposite, never worry about asking questions, as long as you are tactful and ask with the genuine purpose of understanding many people will be happy to answer 😊
I hope its not your intent, but the fact that ""bliss"" is superscripted makes it seem like theirs a more hostile tone to your message.
It’s just a mistake calm down
That's true, thank you, I just really want titties 🙃
They're backhandedly implying that we trans folks might try to deceive potential dates. I'm pretty sure they made the comment in bad faith.

awww, that's so nice of you 😭💖
thank you! 💙 i was concerned for my hair for a second, it got super dry after that because of the salt... but it's fine now 🙂👐🏻
Most cis 49 year olds couldn’t pull that off.
Bikinis are a young woman’s game!

You are, and will be beautiful in your own right.

Congratulations for finally being able to be you.❤️

Best of luck with the HRT. I am 28 and starting in a couple of weeks. 😬
haha thanks! 💖
aww, thank you 🙆🏻‍♀️🦄 honestly being with my friends and feeling comfortable/ not feeling judged helped a lot 🙏🏻
awww, thank you! some of the wholesome posts here give me energy. I hope you're doing well sis 💗
I wore some tight tight panties, and just made sure everything was tight under the bikini, and then i got the bikini bottom on top of my panties. Doing things like tape honestly sound scary so i haven't tried.
it's all about the day you feel comfortable enough to do it, you go at your own time, i totally belive you can do it 💖
*aaaaaaaaaaaa*
hahaha, i will 😎
thank you 🏳‍⚧ had to hit them with the trans flag nails on pride month.
i guess dysphoria is not reasonable, but moving on, thank you! i have been feeling a lot better 💗 i hope you're having a nice day too ☺

2 months! You look so incredible! Congratulations! 🤩
No. Way. In just two months, HRT does NOT work that fast.
[deleted]
Wow you're gorgeous🥺😩 goals for sure💝
*Two months?!* You look incredible!
All the folks decrying ""two months HRT"" may not realize that she may be on the back end of years of *social transition*. You don't need a prescription for laser or electrolysis, or any feminizing surgeries if you have enough money.
Stunning <3
I deeply envy your sense of fashion
Your dress is from Zaful right? Is the material comfortable?
beautiful 😊😍😊
Those legs tho! ❤
Oh my gosh you're gorgeous  
How are you this far when I'm still boymoding with 2 months HRT?  


Love the dress and shoes, super cute

EDIT: I am dumb and mixed up words, fixed now
Wow. That dress is stunning. And your waistline is to die for ❤️❤️
omg cute dress where’d u get it :-D
Only 2 months??  Are you serious?!  I would have guessed 5 years+!
Did you do something before the 2 months of Spiro and hrt? If not you have had incredible results!
Happy pride sweetheart.

2 months!!!!
Thank you! Sis is feeding y’all the wrong info lol
Honestly this. HRT is truely amazing, but it's impossible to do everything in such a short timespan. A friend of mine has a really good transition with fast changes, and after 14 months she looks amazing. But at 2 months, she didn't have any physical changes apart from the reduced libido, change of smell, and sore nips xD
YMMV
I have a feeling that she was using puberty blockers before this and is really young.
It's a dragon that comes and eats all of your testosterone.
Blocks the testosterone in my body
I’m sure you look stunning as well 💖💖💖
Thank you 🥰🥰🥺
From forever 21, and very comfortable...
🥰🥰 thank you
As much as I want to believe it, I find it HIGHLY unlikely. HRT is amazing! But it doesn't work that fast :p though makeup, and other stuff can make you look amazing as well :)
Damn, how the hell are you already stealthing at 2 months? It took me a year and a half just to pass and present - and whilst I never really want to stealth for my own moral reasons, You're really lucky if you can do it at as little as 2 months!
Forever 21, I think it was $17
Just laser really... and let my hair grow
Yesss go off queen 🥰❤️
Its called Unclockable tape
It's a form of testosterone blocker. Not 100% sure if it also classifies as a DHT blocker though.

The hrt was a bonus for me, I have always looked feminine. I’ve transition two years ago but wasn’t on pills. I take care of myself, I did competitive cheer and my body serves looks. So yes that’s only 2 months
And I’m brazilian, definitely have the genes

Yes, you’re absolutely right I got my terminology mixed and meant the exact opposite. I’m very sorry ._.

It was a long day for me yesterday
Heh, yeah I wish 

Turns out I was using that word wrong for quite some time 😅

What I meant was basically the total opposite. I can pass, with a lot of effort, until I speak or forget to put on enough makeup so I hide me being trans in public most of the time. 

Sorry I had a rough day and was tired and mixed up my terminology
Nice. I usually just roll with OG Duck Tape.
Oh!

Sorry, I should have figured it out from context but I guess I was just oblivious at the time :p

Happy pride month from the Prettiest Platypus on webtoons!		"I am sending hugs for the author, the last few chapters hit me hard emotionally, and I can't imagine how hard it was for you to remember these moments
Link to the comic: https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/the-prettiest-platypus/list?title\_no=463063
A platypus??? THE PRETTIEST PLATYPUS???!!!!
I'm... Livid. My mom said similar stuff to me, she is begging me to not call for attention and ""go slow"" with my transition. I'm not a child, I'm 27 but she is treating me like one. Many things said in this comic sound exactly like her and that gets me very mad.

I love you Sophie, I'm sorry you went through all this. What wrong with parents? Why are they always the most stubborn and offensive? My 80 yo grandma took it perfectly and probably loves me even more for it, but my mom lost her shit. *Sigh*
Love this! Awesome
Welp I just saw this post and binge read the entire thing.

Never heard of this comic before but this adorable artwork combined with the invocation of our equally adorable friend the platypus has piqued my interest!

(I was about to make a *very insightful* comment about how did you ever think that the platypus is kind of like nature's trans animal...and then I immediately realized that's undoubtedly why you used it. 😅)
love this comic so much.

my heart goes out to you u/PrettiestPlatypus
Amazing work. This was really touching. Relatable even. Thanks for the hard work in making this comic, something I can deeply understand but would never be able to put in the same light or same way.
Oh my god it's so pretty

Does it get better? It seemed cheesy and heavy-handed about basic stuff before and I’m like ahh ok 👍
Yeah. I have to wait until I’m in the right headspace to read chapter 10 I think after that lead-in. Gonna be an emotional one. Hope there is light at the end of the tunnel for Lillie.
I read everything already! Great comic, it hurts how real it can get. Thank you!
Wow how dare you link this just so I can cry omg thank you aaaaaaaaaa
I love the series so much and it’s been great watching your art style progress throughout the chapters
PERRY THE PLATYPUS??!?!?!!?!?!?!?
ah yes. concludes that from a webcomic with a trans character. very good reasoning, very well educated. /s
Picrews are love,

Picrews are life.
i mean i think two of them are sisters, but other pairings among them could totally happen
I just read it too and it went almost the same way for me except swap the mom and father's perspectives on her being trans and you've got how it went down for me
PERRY THE PRETTIEST PLATYPUS???????????
Wait they have lore?
From left to right, Evie, Lillie, Ellie, and Beverly.  Evie and Lillie are sisters.  Ellie and Beverly are friends of Lillie.
they are characters from a webtoon, it's linked somewhere here

Turned 21 a few days ago and 2nd birthday as me :D do I look ok/shoulders ok? I’m pretty happy with my progress from 20 - 21 :D(21 MTF 21 mo HRT)		"Excuse me for a moment. My phone caught fire from the hotness of these pics.
You look amazing!  
You seem very feminine! :D
Good god you are gorgeous
YOU LOOK AMAZING
(respectfully) you look fuckin hot! you are actually so beautiful I cannot even-
I cried looking at the first pic lol
Yes you look good 👍🏻
Yes, your shoulders are fine. Nobody would even notice what you do. Also, you’d be surprised at the range of shapes and sizes that cisgender women/girls have.
You look cute as heck
U look lovely so pretty hun! Im sure will get even prettier
You are more then ok, you look like a cis girl, beautiful 💕
You look amazing!
(I’m saying this as an acespec person, not a weirdo/creep)

Your thighs actually look really nice in the first and second pic, I think you’d look really cute in ripped skinnies and a sweater in the fall if that’s something within your comfort zone, because you have the legs for those kind of bottoms (I’m ftm so I don’t know if there’d be an issue with skinnies, but they’d be cute on your body type)  Your shoulders look good too if that’s something you’re having issues with (I’d guess so from the title).

Overall, you look really pretty.  Happy late birthday 🖤
You look so pretty!! 😍
Damn you are a stunner!
You are super cute!!! 😊 #goals

Sorry if this is a weird or intrusive question, but what dosage/medium is your HRT? I feel like my regimen isn't doing as much as I'd like and I've been on it for almost 10 months now.
Omg, you are so gorgeous, this is making me jealous. Good job! You can officially be yourself!
Star Wars and an incredibly beautiful girl? perfection!!!

You’re sure that you’re a trans girl because what I see says something else you look amazing girl 💕
Right! You look amazing! Stand tall!

Can confirm- am AFAB and have the shoulders of a linebacker. I used to hate it, but it's grown on me.
Absolutely, I am cis and have *super* broad shoulders, big arms, and narrow hips.
That’s awesome!!! Happy early birthday I hope it’s an amazing day for u🙂❤️
😅I’m not sure, I drank a lot of Dr Pepper and played stardew valley for unreasonable amounts of time so maybe that’s it lol, also where did u make ur profile pic it’s so cute??!!

Thank you so much honestly!☺️ and thank u :D🎉
Lol I actually got a daiquiri on my birthday but it was weirdly strong so idk what I’ll try next
Thank you so much☺️❤️ and I’m sure you’ll blow me out of the water! You got this🙂
I post lots of unflattering pics too for feedback but I mainly just wanted to celebrate my birthday with a pic I felt good about😅
😅wow thank you so much! Honestly I suck at hair so I just asked my stylist to cut some framing pieces at chin length and that’s basically it! Also I don’t like how my hair look up with both sides hanging in front so I do the right side and then I swoop some down over the left ear and I like how it looks :D
Rn I take 7 mg of e and 250 mg of spiro each day👍
I think that's the opposite of what they want babe❤
Thank you☺️🎉

Oh spiro aye.

Damn i need to find cpa to spiro conversion
I thought about that before I posted, but what I meant by that is that they should be proud of themselves.

ETA: I suppose I should have just said that lol
Omg thank you so much, I’m having way too much fun making myself into a cute anime version rn😅
😅I’m only level like 140, got into the game like 8 months ago after following the esport for a while, and I hate myself cause I’m a jungle main🫠

Oh no no no I was making a joke, no harm done!
I've been playing for around like 10 months, level 160 something, I play like any role basically


~~we should play together at some point~~
Ty :3 I think I found it on pinterest
Ah ok. I'm sorry I misunderstood lol.
Oh awesome! I’ve recently started playing ADC as a backup but not much, and yeah I’d be down to play sometime just lmk in DM if u want to :D"	vy6vzh	trans	4052	0.96	2022-07-13 16:07:05
i am being forced to detransition and i’m so scared	"for context, i’m a teenager and i’ve been out as trans (ftm) for 9 months. my parents are perhaps the least supportive parents i’ve ever met, but the situation at home was just about manageable until now. to give an example, they have contacted my school 6(?) times now to tell them not to respect my new name etc. and of course the school has ignored this as is their legal duty in the uk. they’ve taken away everything they can from me, including my phone which i haven’t seen since february and my money, but i’ve been coping until now.

recently, they told me they were taking me out of my school and sending me to an all girls catholic boarding school (where they assured me no one will accept my identity). they said they could not live with me anymore (i’m not a bad kid, i get straight 9s/As, have never gotten detention or even told off at school, and have never touched drugs alcohol or anything like that; my only downfall is that i’m trans). my school is like my safe space as it’s the only place where i’m safe to be me so i cannot bear to leave it - it’s like leaving home for me. so i asked them if there’s anything i could do to stay at my school and they said i’d have to detransition completely. i agreed.

so they wrote up a contract and made me sign it. i tried to attach a picture of it here but reddit doesn't let you do pictures and text so ill just summarise it:

i have to: 
- ""be known as"" my deadname with she/her pronouns (so telling my teachers and friends to call me by my deadname);
- ""dress as a girl, walk as a girl and generally present myself as a girl in all situations"";
- wear girls' uniform at school and wear a dress to prom;
- have a 2 month period of no social media access;
- ""avoid exposure to all LGBTQI+ materials in books and other media""
- ""discontinue all forms of breast compression"";

in return, i can:
- remain a student at my school
- be treated equally to my brother
- ""have use of a mobile telephone and sim card""
- sleep in my bedroom

(looking at it now, i dont actually get anything in return, i just get to keep the things i should have anyway)

so i signed it (because if i didn't i would lose everything i have) but now i'm really scared of how bad it will mess me up in the head. 

i'm scared i'll forget who i am (if that makes sense) and i'm scared i'll start (tw) self harming again as i did before i came out. i learnt to love myself when i was open about my gender and i am so scared i'll lose that. i don't know what on earth to do, i dont know how im going to go into school in girls' uniform in two days and how im meant to tell my teachers and friends to deadname me. 

i'm also just so so sick of them saying they're doing this because they want me to be happy and they care about me. it's borderline gaslighting i swear.

so i just have no idea what to do, either way i'll have to live as a girl and the thought of that makes me sick to my stomach. anyone have any advice?

TLDR: my parents are forcing me to detransition or else they will take away everything from me and move me to an all girls' catholic boarding school and i have no idea what to do."	"That ""contract"" won't mean anything, even if you're forced to sign it.
This is severe abuse. You do not deserve this. You should not have to accept it. Stay safe dude.
I'm so sorry you're going through this. I recommend talking with the school counselor about this, as it is a form of abuse. No kid should have to sign anything to be given equal treatment to their sibling and access to resources like money.
police  or social services ASAP    this is domestic abuse
What the actual fuck this totally is abuse and is not okay. As people above have said contact social services asap. If that feels scary maybe there is someone at your school who you feel able to approach about this?
Clearly your parents are more concerned with themselves rather than your happiness. Remember this when they need to go into a home.
I do not know your age, but consider if emancipation and moving out is an option you can consider. If you have friends whose parents might take you in, reach out. Your mental health is more important than following a straight path in life.

[https://www.nspcc.org.uk/keeping-children-safe/in-the-home/moving-out/](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/keeping-children-safe/in-the-home/moving-out/)
CONTRACTS SIGNED BY A MINOR ARE NOT LEGALLY BINDING. you do not have to do anything your parents ask of you in this regard, and if you feel you are unsafe around them, reach out to the law or a nonprofit near you
This is abuse. Other comments have given you good advice. Be strong, brother. This too shall pass. We are rooting for you.
Get social services involved and fuck your parents, they are awful humans
This is illegal and child abuse
That's not borderline gaslighting, they are forcing you to gaslight yourself. That is absolutely abuse
I don't have anything to add that others here haven't I'm just wishing you well because your situation sounds absolutely horrible!
You’re being abused call the police.
Your parents' contract they compelled you to sign under threat of duress has ZERO legal authority and only has authority in their heads. They can point to it all they want and say you agreed... It makes no difference.

You can always come back out. But I for one don't think you should have to detransition (it wouldn't really be detransition, you are trans) to be supported by your own family. They are being cruel. They are not being decent it caring parents.

If you stop reading about LGBTQAI+ people we will not stop existing, you will not stop being trans. They can't change your truth. They can only force you not to live it under threat.

It shows that their position has no merit that they have to exercise force to get you to comply to it. This will NOT change who you are. This will only delay the inevitable and they cannot stop your friends at school from treating you as you are even if your parents try. They can send you to an all girls' school and you would be a boy at a girl's school. Trust me that they might *try* to convince you that your own sense of self is wrong, but you know who you are and that who you are is normal and healthy, not wrong.
They are absolutely evil and Child Protective Services is the best option.
You absolutely need to call the police or social services about this ASAFP
Hey, I’m sorry you are in this situation. 

If it helps at all, this “contract” they forced you to sign would not hold up in any court or by any lawyer. You are a minor, you signed it under duress, and they are only offering not to neglect you if you put yourself in unsafe situations. It is absolutely ridiculous and they are using it as a fear tactic to make you obey. 

In my opinion and read of the situation, this feels like a last ditch effort. The catholic school probably costs some money whereas the school doesn’t, so they want you to stay there. 

My advice in the meantime is to make a plan and survive. It sounds like you have a great support system at your school, so you might want to think about what you are willing to do to save that support system. Keep in mind, the catholic school could be alright, but we can make an informed guess that it probably wouldn’t be as good as your current school. 

If you can gain access to a phone, that would be great. If you can’t, find something that can take pictures, like a disposable camera or a Polaroid. I would set up a cloud account that you can upload things to quickly that has good security on it. Take pictures of the contract, if your parents make you sleep on the floor or outside your room- take pictures, try to get as much documented evidence of the abuse as possible to support your case. Record them if possible when talking about it, the more you have the better. 
Also- if you have access to them, take pictures of all of your important documents, like your birth record, it could help you if you have to escape. 

If you are over 16, look at online banking apps to open your own account or another secure money option like PayPal or Venmo. Then you could do some gig work around school to make money- think tutoring, painting peoples phone cases, etc. make sure your parents have no knowledge or access of this account or this money. 

When you go to get outside help, a counselor or support services in your area, present all of this evidence as emotional abuse. 

Finally, if there is a period where you have to “detransition” to survive, keep in mind you still have options. If you have great friends, you can ask them to bring your clothes to school and you can change in the morning and the afternoon to spend as little time as possible in feminine clothing. You can ask teachers and counselors to call you by your deadname and she/her pronouns only when your parents are present, as well as your friends. Some of my friends in similar situations had a lot of luck making a “nickname” that was something just really weird (think like: two, or forks, absolutely not gendered and just weird) and all the friends would call them that in public situations instead of the deadname. 

Remember, the key here is just to survive until you are an age that you can escape safely. This is not forever and will not be forever. I am so sorry you are in this situation, but you will make it through. Having a plan and knowing when it will end will help you overall. If you have thoughts of harming yourself, please contact someone in your support network to help you, you can even get some radios or come up with a signal to say that you need help. You will make it through, and you will always be trans, even if it isn’t safe to express it for a little bit. 

Sorry for the info dump, I just wanted you to have as much advice and support as you could. Good luck and please reach out if theres anything else I can do. I’m also coming from the US, so I don’t know all of the resources available in the UK, but I can research them if it would help you.
Ik everyone has said this already but this is the part where you get the police involved. Literally just plain abuse
Sleep in your bed? My dude where are they making you sleep now?!

Parents need to learn that its never too late to die alone...

> and how im meant to tell my teachers and friends to deadname me

Tell your teacher exactly that, ""my parents told me you have to deadname me or they'll take away my FUCKING BED.""

... You don't have to swear but just let them know that it's deadnaming and you're being forced to tell them to do it under threat of child abuse. The obvious thing to do there is to not go along with your parents insane demands and report them.
literally contact police this is child abuse
People have already said that but yes - your parents are abusing you and you must reach out for any help you can
Though there's next to nothing i can do, i'll offer what little consolation i can: no matter how much they try to stifle your identity, they cannot change who you are. even if you return to ""acting as a woman"" it won't be the same in the sense that you're still trans, you still know you're trans, and (depending on how you go about telling them to use your deadname) your school and friends will still know. even in such a dark place, try to cling to that knowledge, as it can act as a great source of hope, a sign that things can get better, because your parents can only hold their grip on your life for so long, but your identity will stay with you as long as you choose to keep it, even if it remains out of sight.  
P.S. if you ever need someone to talk to, my dms are always open, as are my ears.
That's not borderline gaslighting, they just do not care about you. Get far far away and if possible try to get your brother away from them too.
Any form of contact signed under duress is null and void
This is abuse, Call the police immediately, IMEDIATLEY
This is so heartbreaking to read. I hope you're situation gets better, it's hard not being able to do anything as a minor.
For a 1st, minors are not legally bound by contracts at least here in the US, and I imagine it's the same there.

2, this is definitely abuse. You deserve better. I'd try to get social services (or what you have there) involved so you can get out of there.
Do you get a copy of the contract? Because I you do then you have been given written proof of their abuse of you.
Straight up abuse, in every way here. If I were you I’d immediately start a conversation with an adult you feel safe with and start it off with “Help my parents are abusing me.” 

If you don’t know it, please find the hand sign for domestic abuse (flat hand, thumb to palm, close hand to fist)
You might be scared to do this, but there is no buts about it, your parents are highly abusive and you need to get out of that situation, especially before they threaten conversion therapy as you mentioned being in the uk.

If that doesn’t work, call social services or the police should you feel safe to do so.
This is definitely child abuse. Contact social services ASAP
While I agree with everyone that this is illegal and you should child services, if they can’t get you help quickly enough, or if that help is insufficient, you should absolutely lie to your parents. Have your male uniform in your case at school and change once you get there, go see your school's direction to use your deadname for official communications and anything your parents might see only. Don’t consider yourself bound to that contract, but try not to let them know you aren’t respecting it
This is some russian gulag shit.  Just try to contact social services and just try to hold strong in the mean time.
Dude, you can always be yourself here, be yourself everywhere you can safely, and get to a place where that can be yourself all the time as soon as you can.

I tried to force myself to be a man for 33 years, my true self remained, time cannot erase you, your biological parents cannot erase their son.
This is illegal and a hate crime. This is out right abuse by the hands of your parents.
Everyone else's advice will be and is far better than mine but if the- um- shit what is it- the onethings everyone is telling you to call doesn't work I guess tell your friends and teachers to just continue to call you by your preferred name but when around your parents go by your dead name?  I don't know I'm not good at advice but it is what I've been doing around my parents and dress moderately guy like? Sorry like I said horrible at giving advice-

Edit: SOCAIL SERVICES AND OR COPS YES THOSE ARE THE WORDS-
i’m sorry :( it’s gonna be okay !! one day you’ll be an adult and you can do whatever you want to <3
 Call social services ASAP, this is literally abuse and I am so sorry you have to go through it.
Take a pic of the contract and use it as evidence when suing them or telling child protective services U dont need to stop being U
This is straight up abuse, I would get somebody involved.
ewww my mom tried to do the same thing. typed up a form requiring me to drop the trans stuff until I move out, keep running track, and some other things. my father threatened to send me to military school (i’m mtf) i’m very sorry you have to deal with this ik it’s hard, and if able please don’t be afraid to seek out help if stuff gets to rough. hey maybe even convince them to let you see a therapist to help you with the trans “problem” just so you can have someone there for you (this is what I did at 15)
I don’t know your mental state but please PLEASE, just know there are people who care about you. If you need to talk to people about being trans or anything here are some resources for that. Just know you are valid and an awesome human <3

This is utterly cruel. I don’t understand how this can be legal.
Contact the police.

That is the only advice you should take here this is cold abuse, get out, get to the police tell them what's occurring and refuse under any circumstances to return to your parents care.
As others are saying please get cps involved and if you have a supportive family member or friend that is willing to take you in get in contact with however you can
Edit: also gather as much evidence you can like the contract or written letters from your school about your parents contact
You’re getting great advice already but as the genderqueer spouse of a trans woman and the stepparent of a trans boy, I just want to give you a big hug and say I’m so sorry. Please keep us posted if you can.
if you’re not 18 you legally cannot be held to that kind of thing.  also please, please contact social services.  other people have said this but that is ABSOLUTELY abuse and is absolutely unacceptable.  you deserve to live in a safe and affirming space and completely denying your identity in order to even be able to sleep in your own room should NEVER be a tradeoff.  i am so sorry this is happening but please, please reach out for help.
along with all the other comments about contacting authorities i would consider getting out of that house if you can. if any of your friends' parents are accepting of who you are and willing to take you in temporarily i would consider staying somewhere else for a bit. you have the best read on the situation though so if you feel it would worsen things or subject you to retaliation from your parents then obviously don't. i'm really sorry you have to go through this BS. if i could fight your parents i would lol
My god that's criminal. Are there any relatives you can get to who will help?  Start planning life far away from them for the moment you can escape or legally get out in your own. Ot may be slow, but it's something to stay focused on.
You are who you are. They cannot stop that and you will not forget it. When youre a teenager, each year feels like forever and it is relative to your life but you have many many years ahead of you. A few years of playing a character can get you through. Once youre able to leave them, you can be yourself with impunity.

When I was a teenager, i realized I could never tell my parents anything nor act on it. I started living a double life, one in my head and a fake one in real life. I never forgot who I was and only felt my gender dysphoria more acutely. I knew eventually I would become who I am. I did affirming hobbies and had affirming friends which were benign enough to keep under the radar. I saw life has one very long play that I had to always act in.

You are who you are on the inside and if you can internalize that, dysphoria can be staved off for a while. An extreme alternative would be seeking out trans support groups and abandoning your family but that path is a hard one.

Another alternative, you may be surprised by the catholic school. Most of the LGBTQA people I knew growing up had begun their schooling in catholic school. You may be able to find a new family amongst the other kids. Most parents have a similar thought of sending their child to a catholic boarding school for being any flavor of LGBTQA.

Stay strong. As they say, don't let the bastards get you down.
This isn’t a contract, it’s blackmail. « You won’t get equal treatment until you live by our terms ». Don’t worry too much about it being valid, no adult will take its « effects »  seriously. 

Parents acceptance shouldn’t be dependent on wether you’re a « good kid » or not. They’re suppose to fucking help you become your top self and be by your side *even if* you had shit grades and  smoked pot.  It’s the fucking job they signed up for when they decided to have children. Someone needs to remind them of that. 

I’m so sorry you have  to go through this. You shouldn’t have to. 

As I’ve not seen it mentioned yet, try to save copieS of the contract pictures on safe places. On cloud or Google drive, or email them to yourself on a secret address. Just in case your parent take away your phone for good or ask for your logins or whatever. If you can, you may do this of other forms of proof of abuse, document it. Even if you’re not sure it is abuse, it might be very helpful later. 

Stay strong, brother. Take care of yourself and your mental health.
My parents will literally kill Mr if they knew I'm mtf
It reminds me of my relationship with my religious parents... They literally forced me to wear female clothing and pierced my ears with as they said ""fEmALe EarRingS"" when I was already 19... I can't believe I let them treat me like that, but in my country (Ukraine) I couldn't even tell the police about it, cuz they would just laugh at me and wouldn't help at all.
I don't know much about the UK but I'm sure it's much better than Ukraine in terms of trans-rights, so I hope you'll find people to protect you (maybe some social workers or lgbt organisations). Stay strong ❤️
This is abuse, and their demands are completely unattainable! They'll just keep forcing you to be something you're not, until it kills you.

Hope you're getting some help with this, you don't deserve any of it, and your identity will always be what *you* want it to be, not whay other people are trying to force you to be. Don't let them break you down, you *will* make it out of this.
This makes my blood boil.
Hey man just checking in, hope you are doing okay 💗
Any contract signed by a minor is not legally binding.
Just call the police.
I will message you when I can to help you come up with a safety plan for the future.
Legally I don't even think that contract you signed is valid.

Conact legal support this is abuse. I would make sure you have copies of that so called contract and any other information that shows them mistreating you for trying to find yourself.

With worries of forgetting who you are, trust me if you're trans it'll resurface even if you have to tuck it away for now. The things you fear missing out on now you can always experience later (finding that out myself currently)

If you need a friend or homie to just vent to let me know, I am in a pretty cool community of lgbtq+ people from many walks of life. Also very minor friendly!
This hurts so much to read. I wish you the best! I’ve seen others recommend stuff better than I could. I hope you find safety! 💛
child abuse
I am soo sorry for what you are going through. This sounds like it has to be a form of abuse.
Report them to the police, that is child abuse! Especially Mentally!
Please contact social services, this is child abuse. They are abusing and discriminating against you especially with the ""be treated equally to my brother""
Nobody can ever tell you who you are. Trust your heart and follow your truth!
I hope you can find a way to escape their grasp and become who you want to be
Call the police, social services, or childline (0800 1111)
Maybe try contacting the traver project? (I don't know where you live exactly) or the police?
Seal out safeguarding at your school or contact social services. Please won’t care, but social services and your safeguarding will. 
-
It’s not bad to be trans, they’re the bad ones for not being able to accept that you are their son/child.
Call 911 or find the online number for social services in your area. Right now. Do not wait or things will get worse. They only thing I would wait for is getting your phone and money back. You may need it. There is no way that is a legal document so what you signed is equivalent to a birthday card.  I wouldn't run away but you may want to go somewhere slightly far away from your house and tell the police your location. If they are willing to go this far than they cannot be trusted.
steal your stuff back and run to child services. you are more important than their opinion. don’t ever live your life the way someone else wants you too
Talk to a school counselor about it and they can probably get something moving towards child abuse charges. This is obscene.
All I can do is say I feel so heavily for you. No one should have to go through that. It does get better though. When you hit 18 they can't tell you jack shit.  Continue to do well in school so you can get a scholarship and go somewhere far away where you can live as your authentic self.

BUT I do have an idea: any time they tell you they love you calmly reply ""no, you love who you want me to be"" and refuse to say I love you back. Yes, it is passive aggressive but it may get them to subconsciously do some self reflecting. Just a thought. Best of luck to you.
Everyone has already given you good advice, and they’re entirely right about the abuse. As for the “forgetting who you were” fear, maybe you can cope while this is happening by writing yourself another secret “contract” where you’re like “I am still *real name* and I will not give in to what my parents are forcing me to be”.
These people should be put in a mental ward that is just harmfully psychotic.
My serious advice 
Get out there. Call social services. Your parents are abusing you.
If you want to live as yourself you will need to go to the court to A get the custody for yourself, or B get the state to take custody for you. You will need help for that.

Your parants obviosly hate you, and they abuse you. They dont love you as they claim, they dont want your best.
Get out. Take custody for yourself or give it to the state.
Tell the social service you are hurting yourself and that it is because of you cant beeing yourself at home. Tell them you're at risk of suicide if this thought ever came to you. Tell them that you cant live with your parents.

And if you cant get out. FUCK THEM! Make their live to hell so much that they want you to go. Always tell them it is their fault. They to gaslight you? Gaslight them back, harder. Just break your so called ""Contract"" 
Because YOU WILL WIN. Time is on your side. You will win, and then you can live as you want. Let them know that you will be gone as soon as you can, forever, and that it is their very own fault. They will never be able to change you. It is your right to hate them. Go let them know that.

My not so serious advice, this is something i would do:
Ouh and if they made their threat true, and send you to the christian school. I think if you destroy some inventory and insult some teachers, they would soon kick you out again. Just tell them you won't stop until they kick you. I'm certain they happily will. If they won't kick you, just continue destroying their stuff and insulting their teachers and especionally the rector. This is a fight, they and your parents will lose.
what kinda of parent makes their kid sign a contract!?!?
Talk to your school about this. 

At this point your parents are forcing you to act and behave in a different way just to be treated the same as another child in their care, which is straight up emotional abuse. They're also denying you life-saving medical care, which is neglect. 

Emotional abuse and neglect are two forms of child abuse that are taken very seriously in many jurisdictions. Some places, if they're somewhat backwards, won't see denying transition care to children as neglect, but they *absolutely will* see what's happening as emotional abuse. 

I wish you the best of luck, man. You don't deserve this. You deserve to be loved and cared for, and to be able to be yourself. I hope you make it through this unscathed, and I hope your parents get to sit and think *real* fuckin' long and *real* fuckin' hard about how terrible they are. 🫂
I hate to just echo what everyone else is saying, but this is child abuse. Get help asap, please. You got this, man
Tell them to go fuck themselves and that their completely unenforcable 'contract' aint worth the paper and ink used to draft it. If they send you to the boarding school, the school could quite possible respect your gender, which at worst means you can freely live as yourself within it (which I know will be difficult given the environment) or ideally they wont even allow you to be admitted into the school because it is an all girls school. If they dont do one of those two things, they are literally breaking the law.
Best advice? Get kicked out of that school. Identify as a satanist to people and learn what people in the satanic temple do and do everything you can to be disruptive and distracting to them as possible. Teach them that you matter to you and their feelings do not matter. Take your identity by force.

The most important advice of all is to never once give any room to them. Never obey, and always resist. 

I was never trans but I resisted absolutely everything they tried to keep me in a religious hold and I not only endured the pain but I retaliated by giving everything they sent to me. And action they try to make on you deserves equal reaction from you.
Stay strong and be safe brother
You can't sign a legally binding contracts under the age of 18?? Tf??
I would advise you to be ready to disappear. You can do official emancipation stuff when you're in a safer place. You literally do not have to be present for this abuse. It shouldn't be your first choice per se, but a valid option when the adults in your life fail you with no other options.
Run away if you can. I had to run or die.
Do they have a video of you signing the contract if not you can argue that they forged your signature for The contract. So get a new signature with your new name not your dead name this only applies if you signed with your deadname
What in the actual fuck. Does emancipation exist in the UK? You need to run. Yesterday.
Unreal... I litterally teared up reading this.... your parents sound awful... you sound like a smart guy tho and trust me as someone who started transitioning at 29 you will never forget who you are. It's so awful you have to go through this especially when it seems you are doing great in life... I personally wouldn't be able to stay, i didn't talk to my dad for 4 years when I was 16 for waaaay less. Just remember that you have ALOT of life to live after school and your parents can't control you forever... I rlly hope things change for you 😢 ❤️ 💙 💜 💖
Reach out to a lawyer and seek emancipation from your parents. You are amazingly tough to have survived as long as you have. And UK law considers you an adult at 18, once you turn 18 you don't need to have these people in your life anymore.
Bro your parents are abusive!

Dude I'm so sorry
this is like the worst form of torture. wtf.
Honestly, OP, this is just abuse. I know it's late there in the UK, but I would tell any friends you deeply trust what's going on at home, and get a bug out plan in place. Your support network is your best bet to get through this, and that may include leaving home to live with someone you trust until you can get help. You may feel ashamed about what is happening, and I get that, but your number one priority needs to be your safety.
Since you're worried about forgetting yourself having to do all that shit. Think of it like you're cosplaying a character or playing a character like in a videogame. Also just try telling your friends/teachers/etc to just deadname you and use the wrong pronouns around your parents. Technically they don't HAVE to know unless someone tells on you. Also could keep binder or tape or a baggy shirt and some gym shorts in a locker or in a purse(I have a purse i carry around it looks small but can still fit a whole outfit plus like normal purse shit) or something so you can put it on when you're away from them then take it off before they see you again. Sounds like a lot of work but it is do able
Hey hope you see this, as you're in the UK if you're anywhere near Liverpool you should check out something called comics youth they offer all kinds of support for trans / LGBTQ+ . Reach out if you need anything your parents aren't end all be all of your life, you'll realize this more as you get older but you shouldn't need to suffer until you're able to stand on your own many people can help :)
Fuck up their lives too.
My thoughts on this...

Assess what you're willing to risk/reward and try to find the best balance of what you can get while being as true to yourself as you can, while not making your life an unbearable hell.

This ""contract"" is under duress. As you said, you gain nothing, just have basics returned to you that should already be yours. So, if you lie or otherwise betray your parents on this, I'd say you're morally in the clear. They have failed you and put you in a terrible predicament. Now it is about survival for you.

Best of luck. I hope they come around, but if not, things can be better even without them in time.
Document everything. And when you’re comfortable/old enough, report them. 

I promise, even if you do get sent away, you’ll never forget who you are (/pos). Being trans isn’t something you forget. From one trans guy to another, you’ve got this. Your community will always be here. <3
Can you file for emancipation?

Not an easy route, but you seem like you're going to go no contact ASAP anyway
Do you know anybody who’d be willing to take you in and possibly go to court and get custody of you? I had a friend do that with their aunt before in a similar situation. Her aunt got full custody and she was able to live how she wanted. It’s a hard and long process and you may loose things to get more in the end. It’s always your choice and it depends on how much more hurt you can take. It’s definitely something you should look into. You can also get emancipated as well!
I just wandered in off the front page of reddit, but I feel very moved by your story. 

I think you're very brave, as well as a hard worker, smart, and able to strategize to meet future goals. I think you'll do just fine in life if you rely on those skills. You also know how to ask for support and you express yourself well, likewise very handy skills. 

You won't forget who you are. There will be other people around you who don't forget who you are. You can ask them.

It gets better. You'll be able to choose who you are close to. You'll be free to float, and flounder around in the world like we all do, but without the restrictions.
Contracts are not legally binding if you're a minor.
I deleted my other advice cause i read better advices. 
Cause people are saying it's proof it's abusive which I already knew but I didn't know the law in the UK would consider forcing a teen to detransition an abuse. 
So call for help. 

If needed flee from your home. 

I'm really sorry and sad you have to struggle with this, my dear brother. 

*crossing fingers*
How old are you? It sounds like you can't leave them now, which is bad. I am from the Czech Republic, our country is not supportive to trans ppl at all, so parents here are always the one in power and you can't do anything about it. A lot of trans I know are secret until they hit legal age (here it's 18) so they move out, away from their parents and live as they want to.

If this is not an option and your school is supportive, try something like: in the morning put on a school girl uniform (a little show for your parents) and as soon as you get into school, change it.
I'm also sure you can talk about this with your principal so they might be able to still adress you as he/him with your new name in school And if your parents come around they would switch into the old ones.
I see two solutions here:
- First one is to check with child protective services with the help of your school. And try to get out of your family.
-Second option would be to wait until your 16-18 to move out so you can transition. I think both are pretty hard… 😥😥
Contact whatever child protective service you can using resources at school and gtfo, anywhere is better than there.
There is a lot of good advice here. I'm so sorry you're going through this. The other adults in your life can act on this. Hang in there man. 

I just want to also comment on how ridiculous these demands are.  The way you walk, really? I'm a cis woman and when I was a kid I refused to wear girl's clothes. Somehow they aren't putting together that if they have to force you to change everything about yourself with a contract *maybe this is who you are*!
No minor under 18 can be a signatory to a contract. And no contract signed under duress is binding. One of the worst things something like this can do to you is make you feel like you're a party to your own wounding, and it's an effect abusers often strive after. But you didn't have much of a choice and it's not your fault.
Okay, so from what you've said this is what I've gathered.
Your school is supportive; you're out to teachers and friends.
Your parents are treating you worse than your brother, this is implied in the 'contract' they had you sign
You don't currently have a phone, or a bedroom you can sleep in, even though your parents have the means to provide these things.
Your parents have willingly socially isolated you and want to do so further by moving school. 

What your parents are doing is abuse, I would say emotional and neglect. 
Please speak to someone at school. Is there a teacher who you know is particularly supportive (most schools have that one teacher all the queer kids flock to)? Do you have a friend you can stay with for a short while? Or a more supportive family member? Just until the school is able to sort out something more permanent. SHOW THEM THE CONTRACT. This is a key piece of evidence. They wrote it and it admits to anyone who reads it that they are abusing you.
I am truly sorry my dude. I really hope things get better for you. If you wanna message me to chat through things, feel free.
Call the police on them. I‘m serious. That’s child abuse and child neglect and they can go to jail for that. Do you have any family members you can stay at?
0808 801 0400   call here  its free or email  info@mermaidsuk.org.uk.
Move here in Finland. I take care of you. It hurts me to see you suffer like that. Your parents don’t deserve you.
I intend to write an actual response but until then I just wanted to say that being trans is not a ""downfall""

Now, may have meant that that's how your parents, and possibly others, perceive you and you are just explaining it to us in those terms.

I mention this in the fear that they have convinced you of this though their unempathetic, archaic treatment towards you. You are a victim of their abusive behavior and it does not make them right.

You will not be there forever. Being a teenager itself is a transitionary period in your life that we all go through but it ends and your adult life will begin. I can't promise your adult life won't have hard times, in fact it's likely but you will have a lot of choice in where you are, who you are around and you will be able mitigate, to a large extent, how much shit you have to put up with.

Stay strong and I promise it will ease up some. As they say, ""This too shall pass.""
please report your fucking parents
Accept averything they say but not without reminding them you will never forgive them
Do you have any friends you could stay with?
RUN!
This is illegal op- CALL THE FBI OR FIRE STATION SERVICES AND GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS AND RESPOND SONWE KNOW YOU ARE OKAY

You don't own anything.  Stop acting entitled.  Cell phones and your own room are not mandatory.  Just food water shelter and an education.
Asking people on Reddit is the last thing you need to be doing.
You are so young, and you have so many many years left here. Please try the best you can to have some perspective that your current situation is temporary. It will be OK either way I promise
I know fuck all about your country's laws and I can't give you any advice that haven't been already said but still wanted to share my support to you. Keep focusing on the light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how far it may seem, no matter how dark the tunnel is, there's still hope in the end.
Fuuuuuck your parents
I'd fuck my parents up, but that's cause I haven't violent tendencies due to my anger, but try calling your version of the Jungedamt
I'm so sorry. Your parents sound like complete control freaks. Things will get better! Eventually you'll be free of them. It's good that you were exposed to this side of them because let me give a warning that they probably intend to control you and tell you what to do for the rest of your life.
Holy shit dude this is so awful-I agree with everyone who’s telling you to talk to social services, and I’m glad that you’re talking to your safeguarding team at school (your school sounds awesome and I’m so happy you’ve found a safe place there!). 

Good luck, my dude-we’re here if you need us 🏳️‍⚧️ 🫡
Fuck dude, I'm so sorry about everything that's happening to you. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me!
Fuck I am so sorry.  I really hope you get out of there sooner rather than later.  Your parents are huge fucking assholes.
Police or you equivalent of CPS.  
No middle mans, this ist much to important.  
Sadly UK is not in the EU anymore, that would give you some more leverage to overcome some issues I have read in other comments.
SEND. YOUR. PARENTS. TO. JAIL.
That is so fucked up. I'm so sorry your parents are being so horrible, bro. You should talk to your school counselor. My guidance counsellor literally saved my life when I was in high school and in the closet. Hopefully they can help you too. Also don't worry about the contract being legally binding; you're a minor and you were forced to sign it so it isn't. Stay strong, bro
🫂 don't worry. It'll all be okay, talk to the authorities or CPS or anything, they shouldn't control your life, it's horrible that trans people have to go through stuff like this and nobody deserves treatment like this. They can't control you forever, don't give up
I was raised in a Southern Evangelical Baptist home, with my grandfather being our preacher and running a church. I was put through conversion therapy.

What you're going through is abuse, but the issue to me on getting help is where you live. 

I live in a democratic state and desperately regret never reaching out and letting someone know who could help what was happening to me. In my state I would have been removed from my family. (Though from the words of friends and partners who were in foster care, that may or may not have been better. It really just depends on your social worker and the families you are placed with.)

However, if you currently live in a red state, an area that is republican, or a country that is conservative, I cannot recommend you contacting the authorities for your own safety and just to wait it out until you're 18 to move away (personally I moved out within 6 months of turning 18, though it was really hard, but being hungry and more poor than I can explain was better than my blood families home.) From support groups I've been in for survivors of conversion therapy I have really learned that in these areas you can't really ask for help because the law is in fact against you, or the people enforcing the law. 

This isn't to scare you, obviously my word isn't law, but I just have some friends who wished someone would have been honest with them when they were trying to escape their personal hells.

I know for one of my friends when their social worker came (they lived in Alabama) they literally told them to their face, at 14, that they couldn't understand why they (the social worker) was there because the child was ""clearly"" mentally unhinged for being queer.

Idk it's just really difficult and I know it's scary but I promise after 18 they really can't do shit to you.
You don't have to respect their made up contract as they leagaly can't hold you in court to it because I'm asumming you signed it under the age of 18 through forced circumstances. I hope your parents come to realise that no matter how you identify you are still the straight A loving and kind man that you deserve to be and I wish you the best in pushing through this tuff period and flourishing on the other side.
call fucking social services my man
This is actual conversion therapy which is outlawed in many countries (I think including the uk) you should call social services (or the uk equivalent)
this is abuse and i’m so fucking sorry you’re going through this. please call the police and get help. i promise this isn’t forever
This is not okay. I’m sorry you’re going through this. You deserve to live authentically and to be loved unconditionally by your parents.
When I first started transitioning, I didn’t say anything to my parents for months.(I’m MtF, but It should work as well for you.) I used to bring my fem clothes to school and then put them on. Remove them at the end of the day. They’re not here at school. They can’t do much if your school is supportive
This is 100% child abuse wtf. Your parents treat you worse than the USA government treats prisoners In Guantanamo bay
As you are in the UK same as me best advice i can give you is to either:

 A. Go to your local authorities website and contact child protective services on the phone number there 

B. Phone the police (provided that your father or mother is not a high ranking officer outside of the metropolitan police service)

C. Go down to your local police station and report it in person

Even in terms of here some of what they are doing is considered abuse (not all unfortunately thanks to the prat who has never seen a hairbrush) but hopefully they should be able to help you.

And lastly never stop being yourself and........... im not allowed to advocate violence against others on reddit so please dont let them pressure you into violence against yourself, i know it helps at the worst points but its not worth it. 

This older Sis doesnt do hugs often but *hugs you* best of luck Bro

Call the fucking police. Now. This is child abuse.
RemindMe! 7 days
Holy fucking shit your family is insane :(
Make sure you have a copy of that contract. I'm sure social services and the police will enjoy reading it. I hate to tell you this but you may need to turn in your parents for child abuse. Not good. What will you do without them? This is abuse and it needs to stop.
Dude find a friend or a supportive family member and go. your happiness and comfort  is the most important thing
If my parents ever treated me the way your treat you, i would run away so fast. Im already at my breaking point. Im surprised you’ve held on that long to your parents. I dont condone running away, but if you would feel safer away from the, contact the police or social services. The uk has given leagal rights to trans peoples, so you should be ok if you contact law enforcement. Gl with your situation, i hope it gets better 🫶💛☺️
Could you stay with a friends house? Call CFS or CPS. This is how kids end up hurting themselves. They feel trapped and feel there is no way out.
Pretend as long as you can do get as much of your stuff as possible and then run.
I'm sorry you are going through this.
Hugs if you need them.
Stay strong you can survive this.
I'm so Sorry!!  I dk what to say but if I can help lmk
I'm so Sorry!!  I dk what to say but if I can help lmk
Shred the contract, find a couch to surf, jump ship. If they can't live with you then, and I can't stress this enough, __GET. THE. FUCK. OUT.__

They clearly don't want you there anyway, fuck em, they'll survive.
I’m sorry you’re going through this but luckily I had strict parents so I can maybe tell you something’s I did under their roof for a bit with out them knowing I packed what o wanted to wear in my bag and would take it to school and change in the morning in the restroom and after school do the same thing if you have lockers perfect put them in there just in case they check your bag like mine did. Tell friends and staff to deadname you only to your parents they won’t know other wise I can’t think of anymore but if you need help I’m sure I can remember something’s
I really hate to say this especially having been in the system but comparatively at this point you're better off in foster care or a teen residential unit which are lgbt affirming. These 'parents' are going to end up pushing you over the edge and you'll end up 6 ft under I also don't care your dad is a lawyer if you're under 18 you cant sign a legally binding contract period. That 'contract' is as useful to them as the toilet paper on the toilet roll holder. To you however it's evidence of abuse against you. 
Please go no contact as soon as you can.
Would the catholic school even take you? Not that that’s any kind of option. I don’t know how old you are but I would think it might be easier to cut them
Off when you turn 18 at a boarding school. It’s not like it’s a legally binding contract. 

Let me add that I hope you get help to stay safe and free from this abuse. Our local school has been surprisingly positive towards the trans students, though not all the students are. 

Sending positive vibes your way.
>sleep in my bedroom

Are your parents not letting you sleep in your own room? If so, are they allowing you to sleep on an actual bed? Idk what child protection laws we have in the UK (ive never needed them, fortunately), but there must be some laws that should protect you
Don't really have anything to add that others haven't already said so I'll just go ahead and say this: They don't care about your happiness but you will get to live as the man you are so stay strong brother!
I’m so sorry. I’d try to talk to someone cuz this should be considered abuse. Talk to your counselor contact someone who could help. I’d link some resources or give some names but I don’t live in the UK. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you get out of their ASAP. I just what you know something- there is nothing wrong with you. You’re normal. Things will get better, you’re loved and always will be accepted here. Your parents are abnormal fucking pricks. I wish you the best of luck 🖤🖤
I'm the worst person for help about things like this but holy fuck, that is abuse and I really really hope you can get away from the pieces of shit you call your parents, what the ever living fuck is wrong with them

I really hope it gets better and this community will always have support for you <33
That’s horrifying. I hope one day you leave them behind and they wonder why you don’t want to see them again and you pull out the contract and then burn it in front of them.

And then you go live a life as yourself.
Gonna be honest, if this happened to me, I'd run away. Fuck your parents. They have no right to be considered as such.

I really hate advising as such, and it won't be without it's own challenges, but you aren't safe under their roof.

There may be resources you can reach out to that won't have you return to them, but I wouldn't spend another moment in that false home.
Here where I live you are taken away from your parents in an abusive situation such as this. I'd reccomend getting a school counsellor to contact CPS/community services to get you extracted from your home & put in a more supportive environment.

Oh my god that sounds absolutely nightmarish. Your parents are fucked up evil people and they are *absolutely* gaslighting you. They don't get to decide who you are or what's best for you, let alone threaten to isolate you and outright abuse you if you don't comply. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Here's a hug if wanted 🫂🫂🫂
Bro i'm so so sorry.

There are some folks in the comments with practical advice. I don't have much. I guess I just want to validate that involving state agencies (like child services) can involve a ton of uncertainty. It might be a little while before things feel settled. So make sure that you're also activating personal supports at the same time as you're figuring out logistics.

Your health and safety is top priority, and mental health \*is\* health. Think about who is in your corner at school, and make a plan for how you're going to loop them in to the /u/Fulled_ advocacy team on the first day you're back at school next week. (It wouldn't hurt to set up some emergency housing situations too, if you haven't already. Which friends could you stay with? How would you get there? Will their parents understand the gravity of the situation?)

You sound like a really good guy. /r/trans is sending you solidarity and support from afar. No matter how things land next week, a kinder future is awaiting you. That being said, I hope that very very soon your parents don't have the power to mess with you like this.
Your parents did the exact same thing my mom is doing. It’s been 4 years, I’m 16 now, 2 more years ro go. 4 years after they made me sign their contract, which was chillingly identical to yours, I can dress and act the way I want. Mom has made me grow out my hair for the past year, before that I just cut it myself. When I do express myself though my mom makes pissy and perverted comments on how I should show off my tits. 

Contracts signed by a minor are not legally binding. Just try to please your parents when you’re around them, and do what you want otherwise. You can dm me for more advice.
Get authorities involved asap. Good luck dude
Hhjf
Contact social services. Talk to your school. I went through similar and it helped. I hope things improve. This is abuse you really need to get some sort of authority involved
You are who you are, you won’t forget it. Other people on this thread have suggested many methods of seeking support, so I won’t reiterate them. What I will say is that, in the awful situation where nothing works and you’re forced to present as female, in the end, it won’t change who you are. Using your deadname will be uncomfortable, maybe even traumatic and damaging to your mental health, but it won’t and can’t erase who you truly are. You are you. And though times may be hard, and you may face intolerable cruelty and prejudice, know that your are loved brother, and that your allies are out there and you only need to preserve until you’re free to find them. Stay strong and be brave xxx
On top of the obligatory this not okay or legal, I feel you might also benefit from r/momforaminute 

❤️❤️❤️
This is actually how my grandmother would act if i came out to her. 

she is also unsupportive and homophobic. (I Literally heard her say transgender females are men who want to be women. so you're not alone.)
The best part of this is that you get to disown them with zero regrets at 18 and whatever your last words are to them will stick with them for the rest of their lives and they *will* fixate on them. You, however, get to move on and will only become happier the farther you get from now. It'll only get better. You got a while to think up those final words to them, too. You get to make it extra biting.

Best of luck, friend. Stay safe primarily. Personal happiness and emotional revenge later. 👍
also i would run away the night before i had to go
Other people already mentioned to contact social services and try to get out there asap. I don't know how these things are handled in uk, so i don't want to give you bad advice. But if there's a possibility of getting out there, without making your situation worse, please consider it. What your parents are doing is straight up abuse.

Besides that, i don't really know what advice i can give you. I'm not at all familiar with situations like that.

Do you see the possibility to ask your friends (and maybe your teachers, but that seems risky to me) to keep using your name and pronouns, without your parents knowing? Could you maybe find spaces where you can present as you, without your parents knowing?

I wish you only the best and if you feel that it could help you, you're welcome to contact me. I don't know how much help i am, but i can listen and try my best :)
Ok this may seem harsh but I recommend u carry on transitioning as u are and play chicken against them if they take away stuff such as a bed or food or anything like that immediately go to legal services such as police as that is child abuse and if the literal child is going to it then they will have to do something, u said u lived in the UK have u tried childline?
Go to the police and safeguarding team of your school. It’s your parents responsibility to care and look after you. This is abuse and they’re restricting your rights as a person. No matter who you want to identify as you are their child and they should love you no matter what. 

I hope you get the help you need to stop your parents being like this mate. Try to keep your chin up and get your voice heard
that is one of the most horrible things I have ever read
Quote from Wikipedia regarding English contract law (assuming OP is from the United Kingdom and is underage)

**”**Unconscionable agreements can be escaped where a person was under duress or undue influence or their vulnerability was being exploited when they ostensibly agreed to a deal. Children, mentally incapacitated people, and companies whose representatives are acting wholly outside their authority, are protected against having agreements enforced against them where they lacked the real capacity to make a decision to enter an agreement. Some transactions are considered illegal, and are not enforced by courts because of a statute or on grounds of public policy. In theory, English law attempts to adhere to a principle that people should only be bound when they have given their informed and true consent to a contract.**”**
This hurts my heart to read this. 😭
as others said this is literally textbook definition of abuse. keep those photos of the contract. speak to professionals on this matter as others suggested and present proof through said images.
Divorcing one's parents so you can leave before you are 16 and still get support is a thing or was 25yrs ago in the UK. I am so sorry this is happening to you and once you can leave never look back or talk to these abusive assholes again. 

You will always be trans they can't take that away from you even if you walk about in your agab clothing with no meds and your deadname - that isn't you. Just the same as I am still nonbinary and haven't changed anything about my presentation (apart from smiling more) since realising. Too bad for them that gender doesn't equal presentation and no one decides your gender but you.

Living on Terf island is bollocks, isn't it :(
Run away, u gonna let ur mom and dad tell you how to live? Take as much money as you can from them, run away, and never talk to them again. If they call the cops act like they abuse the fuck out of u
dude i will fight your parents
They made you sign a contract under duress, and you're too young to be held liable to a contract anyways (unless it's different there) What your parents are doing is abuse. 

I assume Boarding Schools probably had/has a different definition before Colonialists brought the concept to the Americas, but in America and Canada* Boarding Schools were Concentration Camps. *Called Residential Schools in Canada. They abused whoever they could, but they systematically erased or eradicated Native Queers in particular.

Do you have any other family members that you can live with or talk to? Preferably ones more sane and accepting? Anyone in your family that isn't transphobic would probably give your parents an earful, if not a shit kicking. Maybe family leverage can fix or alleviate your issue.
Bro just leave.
Yeah it will be horrific but you’ve got to reach out to social services. I mean- it can’t get worse? My god. I’m not trans but my 19 yo son is, and I cannot imagine ever treating him like this. I’m in the US, I can’t do much but I’m your mom if u need me any goddamn time. Here for you.
This is literally domestic abuse. That contract doesn’t mean anything in the eyes of the law. If I were you I’d call social services on them. The ‘borderline gaslighting’ is literally just gaslighting. They’re discriminating against you and abusing you which last I checked was illegal. You really need to call someone who can take you out of that hell. Please stay safe brother ❤️
Man fuck your parents.  Fuck that makes me so mad.
I'm sorry but fuck that/them. Sorry for how they're treating you.
Are there any counsellors at your school that you can talk to?  
You need a respectful adult to intervene here because this is starting to sound a lot like child abuse.  
I hope things get better for you, man.  
Good luck <3
perhaps try contacting social services or 101/999 police, to get you out of that house and out of your parents control. this is child abuse. i believe i have various helpline numbers i picked up at my local pride which may be of use to you, i will list them in reply
so id say tell your school about the situation you’re in, and ask them what they think you should do. your parents suck, man.
This is family violence. Have you thought about making a report to police or your local child protection service?
You should call the UK version of child protective services. I know it might be scarey, but you are not safe.
If you don’t mind me asking, how old are you? I’m pretty sure the UK is the same as Australia so by the time you’re 16 your parents can’t force you to do anything.
That is absolutely fucking awful. Your parents should be ashamed and absolutely should not be parents. I am very sorry you have to deal with them.
This broke my heart. I wish I could take you out of this situation. This is so inhumane.
If you have dysphoria, ask your parents to see therapists who can treat it. Your clothes, after all, do not define who you are. Even if you have to wear ""girl"" stuff (though there's no such thing), it's gonna be fine if you get help to treat your mind about it. 
You parents may be right in thinking it's to early to make such a big life decision. Your truth is inside, just know who you are. You're not your clothes, accessories, hair, etc.
Dude, just tell ur friends and everyone in your area that is supportive. This is just straight up abuse.
Its not alright. At all. 
Even call the police or something idk if there is an associaton for minor protection somewhere where you live but do search on that as well.

They are not treating you like their child even.
To be honest, I think that at this point, I wouldnt show any sympathy to them in your place.
Those wouldnt be my parents anymore.
Just the two people that gave birth to me.
Same happened with my dad and my dad didnt do as much as yours and I still dont give a shit about him.

Anyways, dawg, this aint alright.
They also are incredibly dumb to think that going to a catholic all girls school will brainwash you lol
Lots of great advice here OP, you DO need to take this seriously and get help. In the meantime, you need to immediately start preparing to remove yourself from this home environment-move in with a friend or supportive family member, save money/move it somewhere your parents don’t have access, etc.

Detransitioning must feel huge and overwhelming. From what you’ve said here, you need to appear to “conform” to protect your safety. If it helps you, perhaps pretend that you are a secret agent on a mission, you’re working undercover and that work requires you to pose as a girl. It’s a role you’re perfectly suited for because only you know best how to put on the facade of being your “deadself”. It’s a short term solution, to be sure, but perhaps it can help you to stay calm and collected while you figure out your plan. Wishing you the best of luck and much support.
I’m being completely serious when I say: foster care
OP this sounds like some cult shit and is actually abuse. Contact child protective services immediately. Rebel against the stupid contract any chance you're not near your parents. Explain everything that's happening to the people you know you can trust. You have to reach out to authorities. If you can get rid or your sick parents, you can get your life back.
Just want to say I hope everything works out for you. You're so strong for getting as far as you have and asking for help. Keep pulling through. I hope you're able to find more supportive guardians.
Contact your current school ASAP and tell them everything. Show them the ""contract"" they're coercing you to sign. This is child abuse.

I'm so sorry this is happening. *Hugs*
check out the Rainbow Railroad. they help remove and relocate persecuted LGBTQIA+ folks!
Contact social services as this is abuse and inform the school you have rights and that contact would not stand in any court! There is help out there
Bruh, you think they send princesses to all girls catholic boarding school? Isn’t that like bad girls away camp? Call their bluff and I bet you’ll have the time of your life at that school if you keep being yourself.
Look my guy, I think that you should tell someone... and if they try to send you there, try staying with one of your friends. Your parents are sick bastards if they force you to be someone that they know will just harm you. I hope you stay safe. I honestly have no words for this... just stay safe, man.
When you're going through hell, keep going! I can't imagine how scared, uncertain, and angry you are right now, but I promise it won't last forever. My dude, eventually you will get to be exactly who you are and love the life you deserve. I'm sorry you're going through this, but just always remember that it is only temporary. Much love my brother.
Fuck your parents, if you need to talk my dms are open, i also have religious transphobic parents so i can relate
Give them an ultimatum. You tell them that they either accept their son or they lose you. If they truly care about you, they’ll try to reason. If not, run, or just power through it. You are the master of your fate, not them. If you want to be a man, you’ll bloody well be one, even if it means breaking your parents’ rules. If you have any family that accepts you, go there. Also, threatening to put them in a shady retirement home rather than taking care of them when the time comes seemed to work for my parents
Call cps. If you can’t, email them, or something. Check their website (whatever the UK equivalent is). Find and reach out to as many hotlines as possible. 
As everyone else here has pointed out, this is basically in breach of human rights at this point. Your best hope is basically to either get as far away as possible from your parents or to get enough protection that they can’t possibly touch you. Change is hard, and this is about as rough as it could get. But I think most people here have read enough transphobe horror stories to know you’ll be safer without them. 

I wish you the best of luck. Stay safe, stay prepared, stay positive in any way you can. 

Above all, remember that you know yourself (and your gender) better than anyone else. Don’t let your parents tell you who you are.
if you want to go scorched earth and lose any relationship with your parents, try finding an LGBTQ+ lawyer (barrister?), see if you can sue to force them to pay to provide your basic needs while you live on your own, at least until youre a legal adult.
I'm not one to tell people to break the rules and sorry for the cussing being said but this is absolute bullshit!! If you are able to, try and keep your male uniform \[if you wear those\] and bind in different ways and just change when you get to school and before you leave school. And also just let them know to deadname and misgender you around your parents. And also call CPS since this is abuse. They can't do shit like that and get away with it. I was changed to Catholic homeschooling after coming out and lost all devices but my computer but, this is terrible! Please find a way to get out of that hell-hole and PLEASE don't sh. I know it will be tempting but you will get though this. You are a strong man and will always be a man.
I am so sorry :/
Be strong dude, you will get through this!
That contract doesn't mean anything legally, and this is probably child abuse too. Are you close to turning 18? If so, maybe you could hold out
Surely you can seek legal advice on this, there would have to be a lawyer that would jump at the opportunity
I’m so sorry you have to put up with that. I wish you the best and I truly hope it gets better. If it helps, just know that I understand what you’re going through and I give you my support 💖 I wish I could provide advice but I’m not one to do that. All I can say is everything is gonna get better, no matter how scary it is now.
How old are you? IDK what the age for this in the UK is, but look into emancipation. Your parents need to lose legal guardianship of you.
I would like to inform you that what is happening here is illegal and your parents are committing a crime. If I were you, I would contact child protective services and possibly the police if anything escalates.
fyi, contracts other than an nda (required to be 13-14 years idr) are not legally binding if signed by a minor. contracts are not above the law and laws broken with in a contract are still subjugated to consequences. just a tidbit of information. what your parents are saying is utter bs, and has no real consequences. This is just a scare tactic from your parents to try to scare you into detransitioning. 

Just keep in mind, KEEP YOURSELF SAFE. CONVERSION THERAPY IN THE UK FOR GENDER IDENTITY HAS STILL NOT BEEN OUTLAWED. If you can, see the signs if they intend to send you to one, and run if necessary. They might forcefully try to get you to attend on of these camps or ""discipline"" you by sending you to military school or those ""training/rehabilitation"" centers.
You are experiencing literal hell. Try to keep as much evidence of your abuse as possible. The 
“contract” they are making you sign is not at all legally binding and cannot be legally or ethically enforced. Try to make and keep as much money as you can so that you can get out of there the moment you turn 18. I’m so sorry you must endure such abuse.
They don't let you sleep in your room? Where do you sleep?
I'm sorry to say that but in this case the only thing possible to do is to have trusted adults (other family members, counselors, teachers, friendly neighbour etc.) and tell them how your parents treat you, what they make you do, how it makes you miserable and suicidal. It might end up being the case that you'll need to inform authorities about the abuse and hope that some trustworthy adult will try to help you and take care of you. I'm so sorry you're being treated like that, I can't imagine how much pain it brings you. I might be wrong, but I really don't thing there's a better option than informing authorities and hope for the best outcome and get supportive adults on your side.
You don’t have to follow this contract. What, they’ll sue you?
Listen, it’s never a “downfall” to be trans. The greatest thing you can possibly be is yourself.
This hurts my heart so much. I can't imagine refusing to love my child regardless of who they were or how they presented. You sound like such a great person who is doing everything ""right."" Smart and kind and good. I can't believe they're taking you for granted. 

If you are worried about living the lie and  losing yourself, just think of people all throughout history like Anne Frank who had to hide their true feelings, religions, or identities. Brave people have always had to do difficult things to survive. Your survival is key here, and it won't be too long before you are an adult and free to be you on your own terms. You shouldn't have to live the lie, and I'm so sorry you are in this situation at all, but if you can stay strong just a little while longer, you can be free and carry on when so many others, like Frank, weren't able to. You can be a silent warrior. You can survive. You can protect others like you wherever you go in these trying times. You can be a hero. You are not alone. Welcome to the resistance.
I am so sorry you have to face this situation at a very young age. We can’t do anything about this situation since you are a minor. Maybe start a gofundme incase you ended up being homeless. I would love to support you a little
Everyone has talked about the legal stuff, the abuse stuff, etc, and I'm sorry you are going through that. But this is what struck me the most:

>i'm scared i'll forget who i am

You won't forget who you are. We all wear masks and change them constantly, pretty much our whole lives. I'm 44 and have never questioned my gender or sexuality, but I still pretend to be someone else a lot of the time. Yours is a bigger burden than most because it is at the core of your identity and you are probably at an age where you are just starting to form your core identity. It is an incredibly rough time even if you aren't dealing with the issues you are. This absolutely fucking sucks, but you can also absolutely get through it. It will get better. There are people out there who will support you.  It is very hard that your family doesn't. It's possibly the worst betrayal. But you can find a new family.
they wouldn't know if you are not wearing girl's attires in school if the teachers and your classmates are willing to help you. you could go to school with another set of clothes and your binder and change into it. The same thing could apply to your name and pronouns. I have never been to a prom as schools here where I live generally don't have that tradition, but i would think prom can work the same way. After you got your phone back, you could try to contact abuse prevention services and get help from your friends. 

rules are only ink on paper. If you don't follow them, they don't exist.
Ok.... so I don't know about the transition thing so I won't speak to that.... but I'd like to offer a bit of advice about your self harm. 

Since you've felt seen and known,  you were able to stop self harming.  That tells me deep in your heart you don't want to hurt yourself.  It also tells me that you have the self control to not do it.  I just want you to know I have confidence that you're strong enough not to go back to it.  

As you get older,  you're going to learn that no matter what,  you are incredibly valuable.  You. Yep, you, right now.  Because of who you are inside.  And you're going to learn that whatever state your body is in,  it's here for your good.  It is an incredibly powerful thing that supports you and who you are. 

All that to say.... treat your body with care. Harming it will mess with your head.  Your body is doing its best to support you.  Help it do that by not harming yourself.  Self harm often brings regret later.  Self care is always the right thing to do.  

I wish you the best and also hope you can come to a mutual understanding with your parents.
Stay true to who you are. Fuck the parents, stay sovereign in your heart space, you are the Christ.
Stars, OP stay safe. Never forget who YOU are during this. Hold onto him tightly. You'll need him when you are happy again.

Keep us updated somehow if you can. I want to know that you're safe...
You should give it some time tbh.
This is heartbreaking and I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this. I don’t know how’s the laws in the uk work, but I do know it is a big world out there. Much bigger than the dungeon in your head your parents are trapping you in. 

Stay strong, brother. One day you will be free to live your life as you please.
i wish you luck, bro
Is there a way to act like you’ve detransitioned at school? Have your teachers use different pronouns around your parents, and hide your clothes/binder in your backpack?

I’m so sorry you have to deal with this. Try to hold on until you can get out of there. Get CPS involved if you feel safe enough to do so. It’ll be ok, brother.
This will probably get lost amongst the other comments: the advice about child protective services is good. Something you may want to consider, though, is telling your parents that they are destroying your relationship with them. You can give in now, but when you move out, they won’t have a child willing to have anything to do with them. 

That might make them want you to leave now, or it might make them reconsider what their goals are in all of this. It’s just another option to consider, especially if CPS mediates a conversation between you and them.
Go to school take the signed ""agreement"" or a photo of it with you. Also show them this post. Ask them to contact child protective services and the police for you.

This is straight up child abuse.
I hope your parents enjoy controlling your gender now because I doubt they'll see you again at 18. Spare yourself and gtfo.
Please contact cps immediately. Tell them what happened, what they demand of you and show them the contract. This is severely abusive and fucked up on so many levels. Op I'm so sorry you're going through this, it's absolutely awful. 
CPS might be able to place you at a protection shelter for LGBTQ+ youth or at the very least become your legal guardian so your parents have no say anymore which school you visit or anything like that
That’s super fucked, I’m sorry, I hope your able to get out asap!
i have a spare bedroom here in brazil in case you need to run away :( your parents do not sound nice, to say the least. much strenght to you, brother. you'll always have us here in transddit supporting you 💙 (love, a mtf girl who had to leave her parents house at 16 y/o and still everything worked out in the end <3 don't lose hope!)
This is child abuse
Please call the police. I’m so sorry man
Please call the police
Babe trans it's not downfall, it's who u are
Just remember, no matter what you will soon be in full command of your life, just a few more years. Not saying don't fight for your rights now, certainly do. But whatever the outcome of that you will ultimately win.
At that point seek help it's that bad
I'm not familiar with uk laws, but not being allowed to sleep in your bedroom?? Is this some harry potter level abuse shit??? Good luck dude, this is terrible...
idk if it's just me being a stupid fucking edgelord but tbh i would fight back, whether it's subtly hiding or outright being violent


not saying you should, if anything you should stay safe and tell another adult
Just FYI, the contract isn’t legal or binding. 

I’m not a lawyer, but this is not possibly a real or enforceable contract. You seem to be worrying about it, but it’s just words on paper, nothing more. I’m not even sure you’re old enough to enter one. And your parents can’t ask these things of you regardless.
Try to ask for counseling/psychotherapy from a professional you can both agree upon. I realize this isn’t exactly accessible to every family.       
       
Self harm is not something that should be easily dismissed, regardless of how you cope with it. The fact is that many people struggle either less, the same, or even more, and don’t self harm.         
       
Worst case scenario you trade expression for practical essentials/comforts and receive professional help to manage your emotions. Im assuming you don’t have to live with or by your parents forever.        
Many children don’t gain opportunities to express themselves cis or trans. That’s actually the norm for being a teenager. You shouldn’t strive to peak in high school but instead your adulthood.
A contract signed under duress is not valid.  
It's literally just your parents saying ""do this, or else"" but on paper.  
It's fucked up, and I'm sorry your parents can't accept you.
my guy that is literal abuse. if they’re abusing you over that, they dont deserve you, not one bit. just reading this made me PISSED, that people have the AUDACITY TO REJECT THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR WHO THEY WANT TO BE. IT JUST BHVJHFJG&DJYFVJYGVKHFDNFDJGFDJGFSJGFCKJGVLJHGKHGDJHFDAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Call the fucking police
1)Phone your local council and speak to the social service department they will look into getting you somewhere safe if need be (2) if things get really bad please phone or email childline 08001111 and they will try and put you in touch with people who can help you
Save up money, go work summer jobs, MAKE SURE YOUR PARENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE ACCOUNT THE MONEY IS IN, look for flats you can move in perhaps with a roommate and tge day you turn 18 pack your things and leave
Could you inform your teachers that your situation at home is abusive, and you want them to call you by your preferred name, but they'll have to use your birth name on all paperwork and when speaking to your parents? 
Do you have friends you can trust to keep referring to you correctly when you're away from your parents?
Is there a place at school like a locker where you can keep a binder or alternative clothes?

This sounds like a truly horrible situation. Are there other family members like grandparents that are supportive who you could stay with? Or a friend whose parents would be willing to take you in?

No matter what, please put your safety first. Try to find yourself a support system whether it be friends at school or groups online (when you do have access). I would advise having minimal contact with your parents (speak to them when spoke to or if you need something from them, but not to go out of your way to interact with them) as much as you can get away with doing that. You don't want to upset them because it will just harm you further. 

You won't forget who you are. You are completely valid, and your parents are wrong. If you feel yourself going through a hard time mentally, there are crisis limes for lgbt people you can call and text (I think they vary by country, and I'm not sure which ones are in the UK). And remember that this is temporary. You will be able to be yourself freely. It will happen, it's just going to be difficult to get there.
Isnt this abuse
Get copies of the ""contract"". Bring a few to school and tell your guidance counselors. This is absolutely abuse, and you absolutely need adult intervention,  because your parents are endangering your safety and well-being.
You might want to talk to a councilor or someone you trust at your current school. Or maybe at a government organisations, maybe a local lgbtqia support group can point you in the right direction, also considering finding someone in the government that isn't biased against you. This is a very scary step but the way you family is treating you is at a point that is clearly abusive.
I don’t think I have anything else that hasn’t already been said by others in the comments, but I’ll leave this here to let you know that you deserve better and are valid 💛
Brother, this is abuse. You are being abused. You are In danger, and I understand that you need to focus on your survival. Document everything, upload what you can to a separate Google cloud. Contact charities based around LGBTQ issues. Find help online, lord knows I can't give it. You are being abused. You did nothing wrong. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG. Please. Stay safe, don't cut contact with people you trust. If you have pocket money get to Tesco, buy a cheap ass burner phone and a PAYG sim card. And keep it secret. You can get tiny ones. That's your backup. Stay safe. You did nothing wrong.
This is abuse. Ask for help from school.
https://www.childline.org.uk
This is fucking evil and abuse. Obviously getting away from the situation is best bet, many a relative? 

There are good charities that will be able to give you the best advice: Stonewall and The Trevor Project spring to mind, also citizens advice for any legal stuff like emancipation.
I just wanna talk to them


*racks shotgun*


I just wanna talk to them
I can’t do much but you have to knows that there allways gonna be sommone in the community for you and one day you’r gonna be release of that shit just don’t loose fate
Bro, this is illegal here.  Contact the police or social services **now**.  End this asap.  

File for Emancipation.  Details here: https://www.nspcc.org.uk/keeping-children-safe/in-the-home/moving-out/
or at least threaten to if they keep this shit up.

Are they christian?  If so: **1 Timothy 5:8** *""But those who won’t care for their relatives, especially those in their own household, have denied the true faith. Such people are worse than unbelievers.""* and this link: https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-transgender-people

Contracts signed by kids aren't binding and especially not contracts signed under duress.  Don't let them hold this contract over you, you know full well you don't agree with it's wording, your signature means nothing on that worthless piece of paper.
That ""contract"" is not legal. Your parents cannot say ""we'll give you these basic rights which we already need to give to you if you sign this paper"" plus the fact that you are forced to sign it also invalidates it
can i suggest that you tell your friends and teachers about the situation? they will help give advice, especially the teachers, and support better than us strangers on the internet. they could call you by your chosen name and pronouns when you’re at school and your parents aren’t around, but if your parents are around then they can go back to deadnaming and misgendering you? you could give your friends some of your boy clothes and then when you go to their houses/on days out together they could bring the clothes for you to change into, or keep a boys uniform and you can change into it at school. your parents will have no way of knowing (as far as i’m aware they aren’t monitoring you), the contract isn’t legally binding it’s just a form of control, *if they don’t respect you then you don’t have to respect them or their contract*. 

i’m so so sorry you’re going through this, i know it all seems really hard right now but i promise with time it will get better. it sounds like you’ll be 18 in a few years, and at that point they can do nothing, you can move out to uni and unis are excellent at handling trans kids (in my experience). it absolutely does get better, you just have to keep holding on and keep pushing. already you’re asking for help and advice and that’s great! keep the ones who love you close and use them to push through this because you absolutely can.
Just thinking what I might do as a minor being forced to go against themselves to dangerous levels. This is definitely considered child abuse in the UK. I'm sorry I don't know the legislation or whatever but it is all available online. It would be amazing if you have a trusted and supportive adult to help advocate for you. If you could go to them and tell them what your parents are doing, how's it's not legal and you'd like to get yourself access to help. I wonder if it might be worth contacting childline or even better Mermaids as they may be able to signpost you. You could even look for a lawyer who was willing to help you. There are plenty of trans lawyers out there who had unsupportive parents and would love to take such a case. I would start talking to everyone I could think of. Write to your local MP, the mayor, police, church. I would lean on the fact that forcing a child in such a way could cause them take their own life and what will these community pillars do to ensure the safety of minors in their towns. You could also take to local social media and newpapers, but obviously that depends how much you're willing to have others know. But fight this. The way they are treating you is not that of loving parents, despite what they may believe.   


Definitely do a tonne of research, get a support network and don't take this. Sounds like foster care would end up being on the cards. I truly hope you find your community.
Take a copy of the contract to your school and ask for advice or help if your school is supportive Thay may be able to get you help maybe a social worker as I'm sure this is a form of abuse in the UK. And if forced to Singh contract are instantly voide as you are not willingly singing it
As others have pointed out, that's a clear case of abuse.

If you've completed your A levels I'd hazard a guess you're 16/17, so your possible options may change when you become 18.

Contact NSPCC, explain your situation and they'll be able to give you help and advice regarding your safeguarding as a child.

Contact Mind for mental health advice, get an understanding of CBT as a way of mitigating the current and incoming stress.

Contact Shelter they may be able to provide advice about emancipation from your parents and housing. (Citizen advice bureau will be able to advise on the process)

There should be a DSL (dedicated Safeguarding Lead) at your school they should have training / experience in supporting children in similar situations, they should be able to provide advice on what services your council can provide.

If I were in your position, I'd want to make a plan that sets out all the actions that need to happen to get out of that situation and into a significantly less harmful situation. Without knowing more about your situation, living independently seems like best goal for you to plan for.
Talk to a different adult. Whether that is anyone from your school or anywhere else. Someone you are comfortable with. This IS CHILD ABUSE. So many times abuse goes unnoticed or you don't know it is abuse until years later. The other adult has to report this. And then hopefully CPS (or whatever the equivalent is in the UK) can step in. At least here in the US all teachers have yearly mandatory reporter training for abuse.
This is such an awful thing you are experiencing, being punished for being who you are is unconscionable. Hang in there and don’t let them get the best of you. I’ve been surrounded by mostly unsupportive family, but your situation is far more heartbreaking. If you have to weather the storm by playing along it’s understandable and doesn’t take away from who you really are. Don’t give up hope, bright days are ahead, never give up. You’ll find a way. We are here to support you through these dark days. Stay strong dude.💜
I'm so sorry
Do you have a counsellor at the school you could speak to? Or a teacher you trust? You need to get an adult in your corner to help you.
WHAT THE FUCK THAT IS STRAIGHT UP ABUSE.
HOW OLD ARE YOU HOLY SHIT I HOPE YOU GET OUT OF THAT HELLHOLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND CUT THEM OFF OF YOUR LIFE FOREVER.
I don't know about the UK law, but there has to be a way to stop this from happening. This cannot be legal
Go to your school & show the contract to a teacher you trust. Work with them to write out everything thst's gone on at home / is going on at home, all of the threats your parents have used to make you act / behave / present the way they want you to, and everything you're scared eill happen going forward now. If possible, also write out some situations which you see as proof of what will happen if you comply / if you don't comply. Then when you have support from your school  (& possibly a parent / guardian of a friend who is supportive of you if that's an option), reach out or have someone reach out to social services. That ""contract"" and the list are proof of abuse, and if your parents say that yes those situations happened or yes XYZ happened or will happen, it's a basic legal ground for them to lose custody of you. Legally, social services have to respect your name & gender when putting you with a foster family / temporary family *(meaning they can't knowingly put you with a family who are transphobic or anti-lgbt, since that counts as knowingly putting you in danger)*



I'm really sorry that this is the only advice I've got for you.
Dude just call cps and say goodbye
Dude. That's abuse. You need to contact child protective services because that is literally abuse. Stay safe man.
(Warning: memtion of self-harm but by no means a invitation to do so)

Show this story and a copy of the ""contract""  to a teacher/ school admin you belief to have your best interest at heart. If your trust is not misplaced then they will hel you protect yourself and get out of there. They should have the means by money, telephone, internet ans social connections to do soo.

At the very least maybe there is a way to socially shame your parents into not acting on their beliefs (like spread the rumor that they plan to send you away to make you kill yourself. So now they can't send you away because they will be know by everyone as the parents that killed their kid the moment you disappear to a catholic school) . Social pressure can do alot some times. Which is ofcourse a temporarely solution before you have the money making means to live on your own and cut them out of your life.
Show the contract to any trusted adults at the school that you can and ask them to help you. By law, they have to escalate it. That’s child abuse. Do you have access to email?
Hey. Just some quick advise because you're going through shit right now and I'll try my absolute best to help you dude. First of all, that is ABUSIVE AS FUCK. Taking away your property rights and not letting you sleep in your bed is abuse. Forcing you to detransition is abuse. Those people don't love you, nor care about you. The love the idea of a daughter just like they want her to be. You are not that, man. Im sorry if this too harsh. PLEASE, tell your friends and your teachers and WHOEVER you can. Call child protective servises. Do you have any supportive family you feel safe with? They would be great help. Just like some other comments said, that contract does not bind you in any legal way, and they do not have the right to make you follow it. Maybe what you could do for a little while is tell your teachers and friends to not call you by your name when your parents are around. You could even year a girls uniform when you leave home and have your own in your bag to change when you get to school. DO NOT let those people stray you from your identity. You are a man, and no matter how hard they try, you will always be one. Please try your best to not harm yourself, even though that must be extremely hard, because it will just make your mental health worse. Try to also hide any money that you get. They will not win. I wish you the best dude, be safe and remember: you are a man. I hope you escape as soon as possible and live your life to the fullest
What’s your name?  
( your name not the one your parents gave to you)
this is child abuse?? bro call the police like holy shit. this is disgusting you can't let this happen to you
Hear me out - I promise I’m not trolling here; 
Take this opportunity to research the catholic school.  Some ( not all ) are support it ive if the LGBTQ community here in the UK.  You could,  anomnysly ahead of time also reach out and explain the situation.  

Do not open yourself to Doxing by releasing you identity,  but you can absolutely piss your parents off in this scenario if it happens to be one of the supporting schools ( which I think by law they need to, too some level here in the UK )
I don’t understand how parents can do this and this is why I say trans people are some of the strongest you can come out and your parents may not support you it is terribly that they are doing this to you but karma comes around contact child protection services if they cant accept you as the man you want to be then they don’t deserve you
How are the laws in your country, UK? I know that in Canada (at least some provinces, idk, I'm not Canadian) not being supportive or at least accepting of your child's transition is considered child abuse and police/Children's Help line/CPS/whatever it's called can get you helped out into the foster kid system or if you're older to live by yourself and have your essentials covered by government funds. That honestly might be better since they are planning on taking away your privacy which often is covered in law as a ""kids between ages 10 to 18 can share a room with children of max 2 years of age difference and of the same sex and must sleep in separate beds"" (not word for word from Finnish law, I just remember hearing that sometime). Look into it, good luck dude.
Incriminate them both for som crime that gets both of them jailed.
Listen to your parents. They are correct.
What the absolute fuck is this?

Child protective services, Lgbt charities, go full British an contact your MP.
RUN OP RUN
This is 100% abuse you should definitely get some authorities involved like childline
Call CPS. Don't put it off. You are not obligated to respect, listen to, or even love your parents.
Your parents just wrote an admission of abuse. They created a paper trail. It is up to you now to bring the contract to a trusted adult.
Report them, what they're doing equates to child abuse.

They don't sound fit to parent.
I would look into organizations that help Trans kids and see if you can get them for abuse. It seems like absolute abuse to do what they are doing. 

Also if you’re old enough you might be able to just move out and live your own life legally. It will be hard and you’ll prolly have to get a job while finishing school, but it’s up to you whether you think that would be a better option. 

Either way, do some research and talk to everyone you can who supports Trans rights and see what can be done to help you. 

I wish you the best of luck and even though I don’t have kids, I’m prolly as old as your parents and they sound like they are absolute pieces of shit who don’t care or love you like parents should. They forced you into this world without any choice and now want to control you because they don’t like what you have become. Well that’s too fucking bad for them and maybe they should have thought about that before having a kid. You are an individual, not their property.
Ahh, yeah thats really rough man. I'd start looking about it any of your friends parents will support you through highschool. Then get you a job and grind until you're secured. Then you can bust into your parents home in a tux and spit on the floor and flip them the bird before you walk out of their lives for however long you want.
I'm in a different country from you so this is hypothetical entirely but if my kid's friend was going through this, I'd do everything I could to bring them to live with me where they could be themselves. I also know a lot of other people who would give you a home until you finished school in a heartbeat. My guess is there is at least someone in your circle of friends and acquaintances who is willing and able to do the same. If you can let as many people as you can know what is going on, you are likely to find out who that is. Although many people here are recommending speaking to the police, they aren't always as helpful or sympathetic to this kind of abuse as they should be. Better would be to start with your guidance councillor, friends' parents, and any LGBTQ organisation your school can help you contact, just telling them everything you've said here.
I haven't seen this advice here yet so, as a 29 year old who hated life under my parents roof, here it is:

Focus your mind on moving out once you're an adult. I recommend going to university as soon as you finish your A levels, and going as far away from your parents as you can. Being far away gives you an easy excuse not to visit them often. Your student loans will keep you going for a good few years. Get a part time job while you're at uni, in a supermarket or something. Meet some good people who you can continue to be housemates with after uni. Introduce yourself as male from day one and be the real you.

Importantly, try your hardest not to rely on your parents' money for anything. If you can be financially independent, they can't use money as a weapon against you. My dad tried that. I chose to live in a damp, rat-and-cockroach-infested student house rather than ask my dad for a penny. And you know what? I was happier for it.

You will one day be free to be yourself without your parents controlling you. Whenever you feel really low, just remember that. You're so close to freedom. Hang in there!
I’m pretty sure this is not legal, they literally can’t force you to detransition
This is 100% abuse and you should contact the police about it, but for a more temporary solution leave a binder at school/in your bag. They don’t know what goes on at school, you can continue to present as a boy, just let people know to refer to you as your deadname if you’re around your parents
If you get on well at school you should speak to a trusted member of staff, it would be their professional and legal obligation to raise it as a major safeguarding issue. The school will mostly likely have a safeguarding portal where this would be raised to the schools designated safeguarding lead. Depending on what level of risk they deem you at (for example, the highest being immediate risk to safety or life), other services potentially will get involved, such as social services or police


Also I'm sure it's been covered but that contract (legally speaking) means fuck all


Source: ex-teacher and trans in the UK


EDIT: Im not saying things will get this bad, but just to have in mind, akt (formerly Albert Kennedy trust) are a UK homeless charity for LGBT+ youth
You need to tell the school this. You definitely need to. They may be able to help and support you with it or get the needed people involved too.
UK?

try r/legalAdviceUK/ They are very good at pointing out the best resources to contact, and very good at putting stuff in language accessible for young people.

There are options and I have a strong feeling your parents might not be living up to their legal obligations to protect your welfare.

Even in a boarding school the school has the obligation not to discriminate against you on the basis of gender identity, and have basic safeguarding obligations. Which could be very interesting if it's girls school, since, y'know, you're a boy.

There's a lot of bigots in the world, sadly, but there are also a lot of people willing and able to help.
A boy being sent to an all girl's school, if it want to the situation that would be a dream. 

With life you'll never forget who you are. It will only grow stronger with time.
Your in the uk. How old are you you know they cant just do that to you i would get that documentat and go to the police
Rip
Youre a minor so contract isn't legally binding so no need to follow it. Contact the police, CPS, whatever cause this is straight up abuse and illegal as fuck.
Play your parents game to their face, and start planning in secret to get out as fast as possible. Continuing to live with them will only get worse, regardless of which pronouns you use. They don’t respect you, and they’ve made it clear that they only love the idea of who you were, but not you as a human being in front of them suffering 

Look for shelters or nonprofits that provide resources to 🏳️‍🌈 teens. Start calling people at those places, you’ll find more people who want to help you than you may realize, they might have been where you are now 15 yes ago and will know more about your local options

You are who you are, and your parents have shown you that they
What the hell this is incredibly cruel how do people ... how can anyone ever do this to their child it's sick
You should browse less leftist propaganda
People are suggesting reporting to child services. I would also suggest reaching out to any relatives you have who might be supportive or at least less terrible than your parents. Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, older siblings, etc. Also potentially reach out to some of your friends’ parents if you have a close relationship with them. 

1. Having adults on your side can sometimes help in legal situations.

2. If the legal system ends up removing you from your parents care, you will likely need a new legal guardian as a minor. The foster care system is a crapshoot, you could get lucky and get some great foster parents, but there’s also plenty of bad/abusive foster parents. If you have caring adults in your life, that will almost certainly be a better option, and you can advocate to be placed in their care.
RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT
There's nothing you can possibly do to illuminate the truth to a bunch of monsters. The best you can hope to do is outlive the senile motherfuckers.
So what happens when someone’s a tomboy do they treat them like that too
Bring this up with your school. Beg your teachers and and friends to help do something about this. I know the UK is kinda TERF Island but there's bound to be someway for you to fight back and get out from under your family's thumb.

You made the right choice, by doing this you still have access to your safest place, and at least it's you doing this to yourself rather than it being forcefully done to you. It's not much but it's something. You'll make it thru this.
My oldest two are tranz and I could not fathom the pain you are in from being treated like this from your parents. I hope someday they remember how to be parents for you and I hope you find someone near you who can understand and care for you till they do. I send you a big hug and wish you peace , but remember they cannot change who you are inside you!
All I can say is, don't rush to identify yourself as this or that. All self identifications are transitory and our view of ourselves and the world around us are in a constant state of change. Seek to explore inwardly so that you may catch a glimpse of your true self which is beyond such arbitrary and superficial definitions related to gender, body type, beliefs, likes, etc. You are not who you think you are so long as you feel the need to put yourself in a categorical box of identity. If what you claim yourself to be changes day by day (or month by month, or year by year), which is almost guaranteed to be the case, then that is not who you are. Seek to find that which is permanent, beyond all impressions of body and mind. It is there, and if you look in all earnestness you will be sure to find it. And then all of your problems will come to an end.
Everyone's got good advice for you so I'm just here with support

You will not ""forget"" who you are. For the same reason that ""who you are"" didn't feel right to begin with. 

You will have every opportunity, once you are free of your parents, to be the person you resonate with, learn who that person is and learn to love that person

You will live a life full of good music and good food and happiness and laughter and new friends, without your parents, so long as you keep moving forward.

The only thing your parents can affect is how you feel about them, and how you interact with them. Hopefully after this, you will soon have the option of NOT interacting with them.

Keep your head down for now, and keep moving forward. There are people out in the world who love you, and people who will love you.

I believe in you
Your parents made you sign a contract to be treated equally to your sibling and sleep in your own room? They could (and should) go to prison for this, show that contract to someone at your school
Replying late but really do contact child protective services as they are literally threatening you and I’m pretty sure there are laws against this type of discrimination
Talk about indoctrination, like Holy fuck that is all heart breaking to hear.

your parents don't love you, no loving parent put there personal beliefs over their child happiness.

I don't like in the uk so I don't know what you have access to but if there is a teen group home you can go to or a friend you can stay with do it.

get as far away from them as soon possible.
in the meantime find ways to explore and reaffirm you identity when and where you can. find friends who respect your pronouns and wont rat you out, wear the close you want when you aren't near them, or even underneath your other clothing if you can. anything to keep your sanity intact untill you can get them out of your life.

hope that helps in some way. sorry you have to go through this.
I assume sending you to the all-girls school would cost them money, yes?  I say let them send you, but nothing says you have to be cooperative or compliant at the school.  Only respond to your chosen name and pronouns, ignore any and all instructions that do not recognize you for who you are, cut your hair the way you want (or just shave it off completely and go punk), Talk about atheism or non-christian theology at the school, basically just get yourself expelled.  

The other option is to attempt to put it all back into the box, ""do your time"", then get out and never look back.  Both are not easy and either way, you will still be there on the other side.  You just have to survive. \*hugs\*
CPS now
Call fucking child prozective services. This is straight up abuse
Go to your teachers and headteacher and show the contract - they will likely continue calling you by your new name, but maybe not in front of your parents

You may also be able to store trousers at the school and change when you get there. 

The teachers might also contact someone to help you on your behalf. Without you doing anything “wrong” by your parents (they did tell you to explain to your teachers to call you another name - the teachers concern is their responsibility)

How many years do you have left? I moved away to uni at 18 - 10/10 would recommend
I'm sorry to hear this dude.

I hope that you can find some safe adults to help you navigate your legal options. Maybe a safe teacher, other family member, parent of a friend, GP, therapist?

Signing a contract like that as a child is just theatrics/make believe, so don't worry about it. 

Unfortunately the UK is so fucked up for trans kids now, that you can't physically transition until you're an adult. So they can mess with your social life but it won't affect your ability to medically transition as soon as possible.

This situation will pass. I know it can feel like the end of the world right now, but nothing will stop you living your life as an adult. No matter what happens now you will have decades ahead of you living normally as a guy. 

I hope you can safely get out of this situation now. But if you can't, I hope you have school friends who will get that you're a dude no matter what you have to tell your parents. Try to get through school, escape to uni, be your true self and never look back.
Ngl if i was in that position i would either be dead or in jail for murder.
Tbh, a school where a bunch of queer girls get sent might be a more supportive environment than your parents are providing. I’d make a contract for them to sign that just says something like “By invalidating my child’s identity I forfeit a positive future relationship, and fully expect to be left in a home to rot when I need care that is expected of family.”
We love you, be strong 🖤🖤🖤🧛🏻
Is there any other family members you can convince to take you in? When my family was doing stuff like this I honestly just started being the worst person, keeping my grades just barely at passing so I would still graduate, skipping school, running away. 

If they’ve already taken everything that brings you joy then you don’t have anything to lose at that point. Make them hate you, convince another family member to take you in who will allow you to be yourself. Honestly that might be shitty advice but I think you should try to do whatever you can to get yourself out of that environment ASAP because they’re just gonna continue to make you miserable and I know it would be horrible for me to handle as a child
Sweetheart, that contract is nothing but hot air. Your parents are abusive, straight up. Being Trans isn't a choice - If they can't accept you, that's one thing. But for them to force you to do something that makes you suicidal is abuse. 

Are there any adults at your school you can trust? I think, though this is going to be hard and you're going to have to be brave, what's best for you is to leave. Take everything you own and need, and find an adult who you trust at your school who will take you seriously. 

You have to tell them everything, even about your prior suicidal thoughts. They need to understand your parents are abusing you, and that you can't go back. Ask them to call the police or social services if you need to. Do you have any friends who could back you up too? 

I'm in the UK also, and recently at a Pride event I saw a Homeless LGBT Charity - I don't remember their name, but maybe they can help you find some secure housing?

Good luck, I'm so sorry your parents are awful. :(
these people are threatening your safety. that is abuse, period. *even if* we assume the absolute best of them, and that they think they're doing the right thing, if they're willing to *compromise your* ***saftey*** and threaten stripping you of *basic human dignaties* that it's their fucking ***job*** to provide you with in the first place- just to do what they think is best for you... thats still fucking abuse, there's no way to look at it where it isn't straight up abuse, even with the most generous and undeserved benefit of the doubt.

talk to your school about what to do exactly, they sound like they'll actually try to help you. Idk legally exactly what you can do bc I'm not educated and I live in the US, but there *has* to be something you can do, so talk to them about it. I'm sure child protective services would love to see this contract they had you sign. 

*(btw unless uk is super weird which I'm 99.99% sure it's not, you can't just write a contract and have someone sign away just anything. that contract is meaningless legally, if anything it's hard proof that you're being abused.)*

Wishing you the absolute best bro <3333333
Wtf is that even legal what your parents are doing? I wonder if citizen's advice can work for you mate. I'd call what they're doing to you as abuse.

I'd tell your school what you're going through. This is just insane abuse.
First, that contract was under duress, so it's not legally binding. Second do you have any friends or adult allies? I would stay with them instead, if possible. I don't think it is safe for you to continue living and interacting with your parents. Third maybe you can report them for neglect or abuse. Fourth, if you have any LGBTQIA+ Centers in your area that can help, have a friend or teacher take you there, so they can help you. Maybe these centers have resources for LGBTQIA+ youth to live on their own with assistance. And fifth, you need to get a job, depending how old you are and the laws involving that. If these jobs ask for a guardian signature, that have an adult ally or member of the community sign it instead. The quicker you can become independent, the quicker you can move away from your parents and live as your authentic self. The way you talk about this, it sounds you need to get out of dodge real quick or you might do something to yourself that you'll regret or can't take back. Also here is a link to a channel that has helped me and others in the LGBTQIA+ community. This channel is educational and gives great advice. Just keep it muted at home and turn the captions on since your parents are transphobic. https://youtube.com/c/PoweredByRainbows

Also is your brother an Ally? Maybe he has some resources to help you too. I hope all of this helps. And please keep us updated on your journey.
I dont have any productive advice that hasn't been already said so I just want to wish you well and remind you as others have that you will always be a guy, whether your parents like it or not, whether you're presenting it or not. Your life as a trans boy has inherent value, and your inner strength has been proven by the fact that you're still here and you're still trans, even in these dire circumstances. I know you can make it. Good luck.

And PS, if you ever get the opportunity, please update us on this post. I wanna know when you're finally safe. Don't be afraid to post a PayPal or other exchange app link if you need financial support.
This is an insane amount of abuse, if your able to you need to leave
I sincerely hope things work out for you, they sound disgusting and I'm sorry you have gone through it.

My advice is if worse comes to worst, and you need to detransition in school, leave home everyday as if you're following their wishes, and bring a spare change of clothes and a binder to change into at school. 

If you do this, make sure you have a fabric or book to act as a false bottom or some hidden pocket in your bag so if they're ever suspicious and decide to check your bag, it won't be as easy as them just opening it. 

Good luck fr
Bro my heart broke again and again reading that. I’m sorry I don’t have any advice, if you want someone else to rant to or use as an idea sounding board then I’m here for you. Don’t give up and work on getting what you need to live independently from your shitty spawn point and semen donator. I love you, I think your 100% valid, and I am optimistic that you can survive this. You got this Brother.
Deal with it. Its 3 or 4 more years... NOT A LIFE TIME>

Get good Grades and Plan your escape. 

get such good grades that you can get a scholarship and get out, or Join the military straight out of HS...

It sucks, but in some countries you'd be dead already...

keep the faith till then... IT WILL GET BETTER.

&#x200B;

On a lighter note, keep a journal religiously... everything thing.

And when your free, publish it and out your parents...
the school will understand if you explain to them, especially once you explain how awful your parents are. i’m so so sorry
This absolutely horrible and I’m so sorry that you have to deal with these “parents”. The most I can really say here is, try to find as many coping mechanisms as you can to try and help you through this. Whether that’s music, games, art, just something to help. And try to make it through until you can move out. Once you move out and have your own income, they can’t tell you what to do. And if need be, you can cut contact with them, or at least for a bit to help your mental health.
Is there a way you can contact child protective services? Would they be supportive in your area? What about LGBT support groups for teens?
This is the case in the US, and I don’t know if this is true in the UK, but if you’re a minor and sign a contract, it’s not legally binding, so you can freely break your end of the deal.
Report them to the police
If you live in the UK what county??
They are a bunch of jerks. I'd sign it but keeping being yourself as safely as possible. Once you hit 18 nope out of there and transition
Honestly, I might…

A. talk to your school about what is going on - I’m a teacher and occasionally I/other teachers/the schools I’ve worked for have been able to provide a safe space for trans students to be themselves at school and we just use their deadname/pronouns when we communicate with the parents or on official documents. (Not every school I’ve worked for has done this, but it’s worth asking)

B. contact the boarding school they’re threatening to send you to - they may be more supportive than your parents think (I work at a Catholic school right now and we have a gay chaplain and a great GSA club). They may not, but if you find out that they’d be supportive, it may be a better option to just go there. I know people who went to boarding school and loved it.
Honestly fuck yo family if they can't support you for who you are than dip don't get why care for the people are so God damn f****** judgmental when it comes to like trans people it's crazy as hell to think that someone would throw their own child out just because who they are keep your head up and stay blessed
So agree with all the advice and that your family is abusive. I wanted to add as someone who has also been abused: you don’t deserve this. Nothing can justify this, even if you were a “bad” kid and acted out, you still would t deserve this. No one deserves this treatment. And I am so sorry that you are being abused but also that you are being deprived of the unconditional love, support, and connection that you deserve and have a right to. It is absolutely not fair. I promise you though that even if it seems impossible it will get better. There are people who will love you for everything you are. Who will prioritize your needs, comfort, and happiness. You will find them. It will be hard but this is when you gotta white knuckle it and hold on for dear life so you can get there. Im so sorry that this is the situation you are in but it is NOT forever. Keep hoping and dreaming and hold on to the possibilities of the future.
Wtf? This is not borderline gaslighting, it's gaslighting, making you sing a contract to not be yourself so ""you can be happy"" is not love, it's a fear of losing control

Do they actually have a way of monitoring what your friends call you? If not, screw it, tell them you asked you friends to deadname you, but don't chang anything with your friends

If they do have a way to do it, you can try a nickname you like, i hed a similar situation on a much smaller scale, i had my friends call me ""the snail"" for months, cus my dad can't handel me being trans (thay call me my name now, but it kind of stuck)  

Anyway, spend as little time at home as possible for you, stay at friend's houses, after school stuff, find excuses to go out

And my last advise, it's a bit harsh, but gaslight them back. I'm not going to sugar cote it, I think that if they are that controlling and closed minded as to make you sing that contract, you should stop caring what the fuck they want, cus it's clear they don't care what you want, so lie, for your own safety for the time being, until you can get the fuck away from them, how ever long it takes, let your friends know you as how you really are, and lie to the monsters

I really hope you find a way out of this mess ASAP, remember, you are absolutely valid and deserving of love
If you feel it is necessary contact your local child protective agency because these are threats to you mental well being from your parents and their actions are potentially damaging to you.
Hey OP, I've read through all of the comments and I'm glad you've taken the first steps to getting out of there. You're really fucking brave for doing that, I could never. Please keep me updated if you can, your situation really concerns me. And from one transmasc to another, you got this. The best advice I can give you right now is to not give up. You have everything on the line right now. The UK is on your side, go as far as you need to legally. This is severe abuse and the UK will not tolerate it. Please get rid of your 'parents' and don't take shit from anyone. Keep poking and prodding and making calls until someone gets you out of there. That contract cannot legally bind you because of your age and situation, as well as the fact that it is under threat and coercion. Please stay safe and keep fighting ❤
Hi boy I'm a trans girl.
I have no words for your situation.
If i could give some advice I would say that:

1 the world Is unfair, but you are an extremely precious human being
2 unfortunately in this moment of your life you are living with your parents. And willingly or not they are your launch platform for your future.
We are still teenagers, and we are going to live a beautiful and long life. There is no need to rush, especially in your situation. Try to get all the strength and the good this moment of your life Is giving you. As soon as you become indipendent, you will be free to be what you are. 
Play your cards, stay out of troubles and this bad page will fade

Emma❤️
Try explaining to your friends what's going on and tell them only to use your dead name around your parents. If you feel safe to try telling one of your teachers what's going on and see if they can be of any help for your situation.
You're a minor, the contract means nothing and you can completely legally void it.
“My only downfall is I’m trans”

My heart just cracked. I came to this community as a parent of a child who has struggled with identity, and I didn’t know how to navigate that road. I came here to listen and learn. I never comment because I’m learning from everyone else, who is living their own life. This however is where I just can’t. You are amazing and strong and don’t deserve this. You are a child, and you are so worthy of happiness. Your parents are failing you. Your happiness is so much more important than their comfort levels. I have no advice for you, but I’d LOVE to dish some out to the people who are raising you. 

Please be kind to yourself. You are worthy of all the happiness. ALL. OF. IT.
Bring this to a news channel
Wondering how OP is doing now. Any news?

I agree you are experiencing abuse and neglect. While the contract thing sounds illegal, parents make “agreements” with their kids all the time. I don’t think the legality of it is a concern for them, it’s just a way to further coerce you.

Consider whether you trust the police before doing anything. Like, don’t call the cops first. You call the cops if someone broke into your house. They are barely able to do anything that doesn’t involve property crimes, even then they don’t have a great track record.

Telling a teacher you trust is a good step. If you have an extended family member that’s supportive you could maybe stay with them, definitely tell them, or if you have a friend whose parents are trustworthy as well. If you spread the information widely of your abuse and neglect it will no longer be your secret to have to deal with, rather, you’ll be protected by a community that views the behaviour of your parents as cruel. They seem very concerned with what others think.

Sometimes the laws and organizations out there can be protective but sometimes they can make things worse and that’s always the fear. If you don’t have to bring the law into it and can just leave and stay with another adult your parents might stop. At a safe distance you can begin pursuing things like emancipation or choosing other legal actions. The important thing is getting out to a safer environment. The thing is the law is slow and non profits don’t have a lot of money, but they will try to help you. You just need to have a few options and not solely rely on non profits and the law. Realistically, you may need to learn how to get things you need by being a bit scrupulous. If you came out at school already you know you’re strong, these parents are merely annoying inconveniences on your way to growing up.

If you choose to follow the so called contract to survive you won’t forget who you are. I’m not suggesting you do this, but I also understand if you do go that route. I rather like the suggestion one person had of just changing at school, that kind of thing, but I know that’s not for everyone and the goal post of what’s acceptable will constantly change if your parents are already doing that by treating you worse than your brother. Stay safe.
Maybe try and see if there’s any legal avenue through the UK’s equivalent of child protective services? Considering you guys actually have protections for trans people in place where you live your government may take your side.
It’s a scary time to be a parent. I’m trans and a mom so I have both perspectives. They are afraid they aren’t protecting you from irreversible damage and there are only two ways to find out. Maybe give them some science on how rare it is to regret or want to detrans if You don’t have any other comorbid diagnosis . Like autism, delusions, anorexia etc.  This is their worry. That they are supporting the wrong treatment and it might be irreversible. Go with the science and address that worry. Hopefully You find a place where both your needs are met. Lastly, don’t self harm or commit suicide. If You feel any of that coming on get help. One day, this will all pass and Yiu need to be there for that life. Best best love to you. -Tiff
If it’s like america the catholic school will keep you because they getting paid.   Be away be out with friends.  Get away from parents
except i will probably be sent to this school if i disobey it which sounds like absolute hell
And it’s completely invalid as 16 year olds can’t sign anything legally
My man, that is cult behavior. I would love to tell you to leave but I know the reality. I know how hard it can be. This person is right tho. It’s severe abuse. Stay safe, pal. 💕
@whoever gave this the laughing award, fuck u
[removed]
thanks friend
Agreed OP should talk with his school because there is clearly a form of abuse, intimidation and blackmail
Yes, UK schools (all of them) have safeguarding obligations. They should be able to escalate this to the appropriate authorities.
this. absolutely this. that's literally child abuse
Agreed. Contact services to help and definitely show the photo you took to your school counselor.
AGREED  look I'm somewhat able to help you mentally not in court
Unfortunately you signed a contract If they haven't abused you whatsoever then technically they would completely win in court AKA juridistic options need to be avoided(<-- only applies if the contract is legal), (I'm MTF so I've looked into this + my dad is a lawyer that doesn't support LGBTQ+ so I hear cases like this somewhat about 1 a year that's how I K this). Police however is a great option if you specifically file in for Domestic abuse. Also IK you're not aloud to talk or research about LGBTQ+  shit anymore but they didn't say about the law or anything about you're brother. So try asking you're brother to ask you're parents why they think it's ""unacceptable"" for you to be Trans. Also try talking to them first, about how you feel about differences about  you're body and you're personality that arent ""compatible"". If they refuse to let you go trans after that than call the police to file for Domestic abuse. Pls Hang in there, Bro 

YOU GOT THIS!
[removed]
I'm gonna hijack the top comment cuz I need help. I'm the father of a 16 year old girl wanting to transition to male and for now I said let wait till 18 so she can decide as an adult. Now I feel like I'm not being a good dad. I don't know what to do
Is it different than america? It’s really bad when they take you here, sent to a group home where you’ll be viciously abused by the other kids, and maybe the staff if you’re unfortunate. High chance the group home is catholic too.. 

I hope it’s better over there. Here people like op just run away and try to make it on their own. Not that there’s no help per say, but it depends where you are, and it’s unlikely housing will be an option.
I dont know if this is a good idea. Police rarely help situations. What can they do in this situation? They can't force them to treat their son like his brother.

I know this is abuse. I agree. But does the law in their area consider it abusive? Idk. I doubt the police will care and there is no guarantee he will find a social worker that will care, although I believe that's far more likely than a cop. Most cops will treat the OP like he's the crazy one.

Op should consider their situation carefully. Calling the authorities is not guarantee they will take his side and it could make the situation even worse in some ways. I'm not saying they shouldn't seek help, I'm saying I don't know that involving the police or social services is necessarily help.

He has 2 years or less and OP can GTFO. It's an eternity at 16, i know, but two years will come and go and they can get to a better place.

Op if I were you I would look to see if there are any trans support groups in your area. They will have a better idea of how the police and social services in your area will react to you. They might have better advice based on how the community treats trans folks in general. Be very careful here. Once social services and police are involved, anything can happen, including being taken from your home, however unlikely, and ending up in a worse situation.

I really believe you should look for a local trans group or LGBT+ group and get their opinion. Being in a community of others that understand can make a world of difference.

You deserve happiness, love and acceptance. Hang in there and you will find it.
i have spoken to a teacher and they told the safeguarding team who have spoken to my parents and are figuring something out. i haven't had a chance to show them the contract yet so will do when they next speak to me
haha as soon as i get a chance!
This^ I had abusive parents and moved out when I was 15. All I had to do was threaten to file for emancipation and they allowed me to leave. Best choice I ever made!

Best of luck to you <3

Edit: If you happen to be in Idaho, I have resources that can help you!
Also, even if _not_ signed by a minor, contracts signed under duress are not binding either (OP says they were _made_ to sign it).
okay thank you good to know
No illegal contract is legally binding.
far more important than that, like insanely more important than that, its not like you can just write down an agreement and call it a legally binding contract. In the U.S. it can lay the groundwork for a civil suit if someone agrees to do something for an amount, then that thing isn't paid, but in this case, it is an unnotarized piece of paper, with essentially meaningless parameters. It sounds like less of a contract and more of a scare tactic
agreed
thanks :)
i tried taking a picture and they tore it up and then reprinted it. i wasnt allowed a copy but i fished out the pieces they tore up from the trash and spent a few hours taping them up so yes i do have a copy
omg they make me see this therapist who is so blatantly transphobic
It's not legal.  
British citizens can be legally charged for hate crimes under these circumstances as one of my friend's parents got into hot water over it.
oh god that’s terrible man i hope you’re okay now. im half polish and go to poland a lot so i do know how difficult it can be in some places, im really lucky to live in the uk.
Also what does ""Sleep in your Bedroom"" mean?
Where are you sleeping now? Under the stairs like Harry Potter or what? wtf
Tell social services about such abuse.
And if they were forced upon you by threat of  punishment
The fbi? Lmao they have bigger issues.
pc
i genuinely didnt feel like i had a choice, i didnt even have time to think about it because i asked if i could have a few days and they were all ""tHe dEaL is OfF"". not sure if this counts but my dad who is a lawyer wrote the contract :D
Its very likely not a legally binding contract... its just some silly written up contract their parents wrote up and had their kid sign. Like a chore contract kids might sign with their parents, you don't need a lawyer for that lmao... It was also signed under duress meaning it would be void anyway. But seeing as how both not signing it AND breaking it means all the bad things happen anyway there is no way this is a ""legal"" contract much less one that needs lawyers present. Silly comment
Ratio
Losername does not check out.
Fuck parents that don’t do right by their children.

lmao thanks for the advice, in the uk i can move out when i turn 16 so just waiting for that lol not too long now
Yea.. call child protective services?

Also, pro tip: leave home in girls clothes, change in the bathroom, do reverse when going home?

I mean.. their so awful.. would it bother you to seek rehoming possibly via adoption through social services into an accepting family?
It doesn’t justify all of those stupid thing just because he’s transgender, which by the way is natural cause we are born this way. So completely full of non sense to give the parents some credits there, you can as some point lost i admit but you can also look forward and think that it’s better to have a child who’s happy to be than death and buried.

Real case I used to know sadly is that my girlfriend who was also transgender, we were trying to work this out and the mom was completely acting like a douche not because of any mistake or what, just to make her and us mad … a parent like that should never have the right to educate his child, and I’m not wrong ont his those are hypocrites. They are the one capable to came to their child funeral and fake crying and leave in a minute but not caring at all for their child happiness.
>except i will probably be sent to this school if i disobey it which sounds like absolute hell

Brother you're going through absolute hell right now. They're just gonna keep upping their demands until they've ""fixed"" you. You've gotta act, NOW. This shit's illegal, nip it in the bud ASAP
Just an FYI to be a bit more clear, you cannot be legally bound by a contract if you're a minor. That ""contract"" has no more significance than any other pieces of paper.

Edit: also take Aphrodite's advice. Keep the contract, or a copy of it.
You could try to get kicked out of the school, but that might not end well.
Why not give the religious school hell back? When they deadname you, say your name. ALWAYS violate the dress code. Go in the mens restroom. Your parents are really trying to take from you your most prized posession, your identity. Don't give it to them.
hey man, while there might very well be transphobes at an all-girls school, at least some of your peers will be cool with you. Plus, you don't have to live with your parents if you're at a boarding school.

My boarding experience was LITERALLY the best experience I could have had in my life, simply because it got me away from abusive parents. Trust me when I say you'll be happier out of the rule of your parents, even in an all-female school. There, you can at least express yourself how you want to.

My thoughts are with you, kid. I'm sorry you're going through shit like this.
Your parents would be pretty stupid to do that. The ""contract"" is not legal and is actually evidence that your parents abused you. It's probably a scare tactic to make you think you are obligated to obey them.
As someone with parents very similar to yours: that contract doesn’t mean shit. They are forcing you to sacrifice your mental health for things you should have in the first place and it won’t stop there.
[removed]
You should talk to a councillor at school. This is abuse. Your parents are abusing you knowingly. This is ground for you to be liberated from them.
CPS is your best friend.
You can tell the school your parents threatened you, and it was signed under duress, which means it's not legally binding.
they’d do that with or without the contract. their power over you comes from them abusing their roles as parents. you’re being given the illusion of choice, nothing more.

I can’t give you any advice about what actions you can take, but, if you can manage it, hold fast to the knowledge that a decision forced upon you is not your decision at all. you never chose to detransition. you never chose to go by your deadname. you never chose to wear that uniform.

you might have to do all those things, and my heart breaks for you, but maybe it can help to realize that you won’t be betraying yourself. you’re just doing what you need to do to survive until you can finally break free.
Girls catholic school isn’t the worst place in the world for a trans guy. A shocking number of people there will be lgbt… no guys to date? They just date each other.

If it’s a boarding school you get to go away from your parents, too.
A contract signed by coercion is automatically invalid!
FYI you can flag awards and if enough people do this it will get rid of it, still angry some fucker actually finds that comment funny
While I agree wholeheartedly, it’s best not to give them that attention. Just let them waste their cash on reddit coins
might have been a free award, not sure how they work. still, not appropriate.
Child abuse js ""physical, sexual, and/or psychological maltreatment or neglect of a child or children, especially by a parent or a caregiver."" 

Explain to me, in detail, how it is not psychological abuse to force your child to conform to your ideal version of what they should be, isolate them from their friends and peers, and emotionally neglect them by withholding love and support.

Remember: conversion therapy is literally considered abuse.
If possible, you may be able to move in with a friend. It’s not betrayal, the adults in your life have already failed to be parents. Getting away from them is top priority. Much love
[removed]
i will do when the safeguarding team next speaks to me!
[removed]
He is a minor that was coerced into signing away their rights, to his parents, under threat of continuance and furtherance of abuse. This 'contract' is in no ways legal, or holds any legal weight, any judge that gives a shit about the law would take this as evidence against the parents not the child, as this 'contract' is itself abuse.
The contract's irrelevant.

>(looking at it now, i dont actually get anything in return, i just get to keep the things i should have anyway)

Contracts require consideration, i.e. some benefit for both parties. Since OP's parents are *already* obligated to perform their end of the bargain, the contract is void.
no. that contract is not legally binding whatsoever. you cant sign over your rights, it is with a minor and they were under duress. this is not great advice op. your best bet is child services and there are many trans helplines you can talk to about this stuff
many contracts between adults or companies have illegal clauses that a judge wouldn't enforce. doesn't matter if both parties signed and understood. a minor first often cannot sign a contract at all, second cannot sign away their rights to their parents.

It’s not a light thing for most trans people to come out to their parents, there’s a good chance he’s been thinking about it for a while, you should talk to him about it and just try to learn more
the most common misconception is that it is a decision. it is not. if i hadn’t come out, i would have committed. let your child be themselves please, that doesn’t have to involved letting them medically transition, just let them express themselves
Congrats you’re the shitty parent of a 16 year old boy. Go do the bare minimum for him
Let him transition socially, see if he likes it, nothing permanent, no need for hormones, just identity (call him male pronouns, chosen male name, address him as your son) and dress. Let him see a mental health professional for a diagnosis.
Maybe settle for puberty blockers till 18? I dunno, I'm not trans, and I'm not a parent, I'd like to think I wouldn't care and believe them, but I'm antinatalist and in no position to adopt so I'll never have a kid
You are being abusive and exerting coercive control
Considerably different
""the team has talked to my parrents"" but not you? you as the victim should be the 1st person they talk to
good luck, man.
I'm glad you showed them, I'm so very sorry you are going through this. Hold fast to who you are, we know you are valid, your parents are so mistaken and are being abusive. I am the mom of a trans kid and wish I could talk to your parents.
Best wishes! What they're doing is really messed up, I hope things get better soon.

<3333333
Stay strong brother.
Good luck man
literally call up child protective services and tell them you are being abused, you need to be proactive with this or you will be forced to live like this until you are financially independent
Honestly if I were you, move out ASAP and f*ck them off out of your life and never speak to them again.
there's a little less legal precedence there, especially in the uk, because a trans person being told by their parents they'll be enrolled in a different school (something they could do for any reason) if they don't detransition isn't necessary duress, just a parental consequence. to be clear, i 100% disagree with that line of reasoning, but if i were a british judge i would probably follow it
This would be the nonprofit near you, as someone from the UK, I guess.

btw and even if it where binding. A contract has to have an expire date, or a regulation with what time delays it can be canceled.
If nothing is determined and there is no law in place for a certain type of contract there is no time delay to a cancellation. For your ""Contract"" there is certainly no law in place. 

Would be gold if you just write them a cancelation haha.

Dear Mr. and Ms. legal parent, 

with this letter i cancel our contract from DATE, to the DATE. 

Go fuck yourself you FUCKERS

Sincerly your Son


Actually having their abuse signed by them self could really help you. They testify by their sign that they are abusing you.
As a student in the UK, the easiest way to do this is simply talk to your favourite teacher and explain the situation in detail. They have a duty of care and are required to pass it to a safeguarding lead, another teacher at the school, who will assess it and in turn reach out to other services.
Considering that this contract is in no way enforceable and could be used against them as evidence of child abuse, their destruction of the document you signed nullifys the issue of enforcement and so now it's an issue of destruction of evidence. 

And you say your dad is a lawyer? Not a very good one, it sounds like. You should study the law because I think you will have to defeat him to be free. And you could. He is weak and vain, and you're smarter.

Good luck dude. That's going to be rough but you can survive this! Honestly even Catholic school is less abusive than your dad, and Catholic school sucked.
Good thought! Show it to safeguarding. Best of luck man, we're all rooting for you here.
That is conversion therapy. There's a hotline for victims of conversion therapy in the uk, they might be able to help.

https://galop.org.uk/get-help/helplines/
yikes i’m sorry
Good to know. I’m American, so I don’t know the law in the UK.
I really hope you'll be able to start your transition very soon, my friend 😊 I managed to start mine at the age of 20 and I'm absolutely happy with the changes
Also they don't operate outside of the US...
Offf in so sorry doll that’s terrible. No that actually is worse.
Don't worry, signing it doesn't change anything. It doesn't even matter that this ""contract"" was written by a lawer. Forcing your child to sign a ""contract"" that says that to be treated with decency you have to live a certain way is simply not legal.
[removed]
[removed]
This isn’t the place to do that.
also, consider bringing this situation up with any councillors you see in school (or any teacher you trust). getting across the severity of the situation and the consequences you face/the abuse you have suffered, this should stress the importance of confidentiality in this situation between the school and your parents(so as to avoid making things worse by the school telling your parents youre being vocal about this). schools also have communication with local police forces, meaning they are able to effectively notify the police of a safeguarding concern as severe as this.
thanks you’re a wonderful person i’ll work something out
However it is useful as evidence of child abuse. The OP should acquire a copy of that contract and put it away in a safe place.
also contracts signed under threat/duress are null and void
Also being coarser into a signing a contract invalidates it even is op wasn’t a minor
I was thinking he might get kicked out of an all girls catholic school just for being an openly trans guy, honestly. Or maybe transferred to an all boys Catholic school? Like the character Elle on Heartstopper
This.
Best suggestion ever. If OP winds up getting transferred to an all-boys school for doing all that (which may not necessarily happen), then more power to him.
I understand and agree with the point of this comment but I don’t think an all girls catholic school will have a mens restroom
Would this be legally considered abuse?
I would keep a copy of that to give to child protective services as well.
I just saw in the UK, contracts signed by a minor are binding in the case of apprenticeship, employment, education, and services where the minor is the beneficiary, this is not the case at all. So don't worry, you can lie to them without legal damage. Still you should call for help, CPS and such, because you're not safe in your own household
No one cares what you think as you’re objectively incorrect. Your opinion and views are insignificant
Thanks, I flagged them. Didn’t know you could flag awards.

This is not funny, wtf is your problem?
Don’t wait, this is not legal, you need support now. I hope you can get away and be yourself 🤞🏻💚
If you can, take a picture of the ""contract"". It could be important evidence.
Please get help as soon as you can, you don’t deserve that sort of treatment.

Here are some phone numbers that may help you.

Emergency police - 999

Non emergency police - 101

Child line - 0800 1111
Please keep us updated, I wish the very best to you <3
please do this now, bcuz this is outrageous, to an extend where im reloading my imaginary shotgun with a ""religious"" intent.

please try to survive thrue this, as at some point you will come out at the top.

stay safe, youre valid <33
Do not wait. Call someone, call for help.

You are being abused. Whatever the UK equivalent for 911 is(I forgot what it was called), you need to do something.

You're in danger.
Hey, social working in training here, I just finished legislation unit and we not only learnt about laws here in Aus but elsewhere. Don't wait, get help as soon as we can, the longer and more comprehensive your paper trail is, the more likely you are to get somewhere. It's shouldn't be on you to advocate for yourself but you need to make it clear you're being abused which you are and that your parents are harming you. 

Be clear, be concise, e.g. ""My parents, their treatment of me and their disregard of my true identity is causing me both mental and emotional distress. It is making me consider self-harm, if the situation does not change I will be at risk of a mental health crisis."" 

I really hope things pan out for you, please give us updates if you feel you can.
Why are you working your shit out on others? Because YOU lived through hardships? Pathetic.
This ^^^^

Can't speak for if this is illegal or not, but the contract is in no way enforceable or legally binding given the topics it supposedly covers. Even an adult cannot sign a contract that allows an abuser to break the law, because its not up to you what laws apply and where, without it being considered void.

Essentially, all OP has done is sign a bit of their parents fanfiction. It means as much as it did when it was a blank piece of paper.

Tbh the bigger issue here is OP being a minor and therefore still in care of parents, so it's more on if they want to try and endure the care system or not.

Source - worked for a contract law firm (not as a lawyer to be clear) and this kind of issue frequently crops up. Abusers like to think a contract can protect them from anything, but its actually not that easy to write a legally binding contract, and they frequently void their own documents.
I mean it was void the second they had a minor sign it anyways

I can confirm it's been a couple. She told me during COVID crises back in 2020. I raised my 3 girls alone. My middle daughter is autistic and I'm in constant fear of her being bullied. My first reaction was fear that now my oldest was going to make herself a target. I'm passed that now, but I just don't know if I'm being a jerk by saying wait till 18? To complicate matters I named her after my favorite grandma so that makes me sad too. Help
Thanks so much that's suppppppeeerrr helpful
This is excellent advise. I guess me reaching out here was the last step for me to accept
I literally just heard about them. I think it's too late cuz she has a very obvious female shape she hides. She spoken of getting her breasts removed too. My mother had breast cancer and had that done I'll never forget those chest scars
Good to here.

We have some really awful social systems here. Mostly designed to punish the poor. 

One of my best friends growing up was a bit of a misfit, his mom couldn’t control him, and she was blacked out on pills all the time. She kept calling the police when he didn’t listen to her delirious ass. After enough calls, they took him, sent him to the group home, where he was held down and beaten for being white every single day until he could escape. The other kids wouldn’t let him eat, kept taking his food, said things like “you’re white, you’ll be alright” they’d throw Mayo at him…. The group home was forcing him into religion, beating him with a paddle for telling on the other kids who abused him…. and this is one of the “good” states systems. One of the best even, it only gets worse. 

We have support groups for runaway trans kids and stuff, but they aren’t all over the place, and they don’t necessarily provide housing. It’s unlikely even and any support you can find is probably backed up and underfunded. 

It’s a fucking disgrace that “the wealthiest country in the world” can’t take care of it’s people who need help the most.
Yeah that's a huge red flag, I'd consider them I lability and find a third party to help.
Never speak to them again… until it’s possible to put them in the worst retirement home available
sure but it wasn't witnessed by a third party and they're a minor so regardless of the content of the contract it wouldn't be legally binding. it's not necessarily illegal that they made the op sign it it's just not legally enforceable in anyway.
I think the part where he was made to sign a contract where he wasn't allowed to sleep in his own bed means it might count as under duress - do they mean literally kicking him out, or taking away his literal bed? Forcing him to sleep in a basement/other room, bedless? All of these point to making him sign to agree to avoid to conditions which could be seen as abusive, and that might help form his case.
I'm not sure how it is in the UK, but the way I was taught in a US legal studies class (so only a very cursory amount of knowledge) is that both parties have to actually gain something from a contract in order for it to be legitimate. The example we were always given was that if you signed a contract where you agreed to work for free for years, it would never be enforceable.

OP signed a contract where they ""get"" things not taken away from him. OP makes a bunch of concessions and in return gets things to remain the ""same.""
so happy for you!
Didn’t even see that op was in the uk maybe they should call mi6 🤣
yeah :/
Parents that aren’t ready to love and support their kid however they turn out shouldn’t have children.

This right here is a perfect example of shitty parents being fucking shitty.

Keep up with the times or get the fuck out of the way.
They are forcefully suppressing their child’s identity, which is going to cause a lot of emotional and mental trauma.  I know because I’ve lived it.

I don’t care how fucking hard it is to “accept”, you either do right by your child and love them how they are or you’re a shitty parent that should have never reproduced.
Except it is?? Tf you on about
Contact child protective services in your area.
Reach out to charity organisations, government social workers are completely useless (not always their fault though).

Here is a good start, Mermaids/AllSorts and many others will point you in right direction and help you:
https://www.google.com/search?q=uk%20trans%20kids%20charity%20&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
Contact a lawyer of you can. Not only is that contact not legally binding due to coersion, half the stuff in there would/should make for a stupid easy court case.

(I am not a lawyer)

Child abuse is fucked and i get legitamately almost violently angry when i see or think about it for personal reasons.

This is absolutely on your parents, and has nothing to do with you. You probably are aware of all this, but they are terrible people. They are abusive as fuck and if you can prove it, great. They deserve what ever shit happens to them. I wish I could help somehow, this shit makes me so angry.

As satisfying as it might be to try and antagonize them, or carry out ""malicious compliance"" it might be satisfying short term, but it will be worse long term. At the very least, you mentioned living in the uk, so you shouldn't have to deal with the stupiddest parts of american stuff. Presumably you have some form of access to health care and such which is huge.

Right now, the best thing you can do is to get out. The sooner the better, but not at the cost of tying yourself to someone else, (**anyone** else, as you'll simply be trading one tyrant for another, even if that person means well) or putting yourself in a significantly worse situation. This is not going to get better, and the people who are **not** your parents, but **are** the people who technically gave birth to you, are not going to stop escallating things. If you happen to fuck up thier lives on your wat out of thiers, good. They more than deserve it. It's not unlikely that you may feel guilt for something like that, but you shouldn't. They are terrible people who are ruining thier own lives. Whatever happens is on thier heads for being such biggoted people. If your brother (assuming he's old enough to understand) doesn't see an issue with things that's a problem in and of itself. I knew the way someone else was being treated, wasn't right, but didn't say anything because i knew my head was next on the metephorical chopping block. It still didn't make the situation ok, and if i could have i would have liked to point out the stupidity and hypocrisy of the situation, but i wasn't brave enough to risk suffering the consequences.

If you feel any regret or compassion for the people actively hurting you, my parents were/are dumb as fuck, despite one being ""rather smart"", but only in certain areas and stupid as hell everywhere else. Some part of me still hates them. Your ""parents"" are actively maliciously hatefully making things worse. And whatever excuses they have aren't enough to justify thier behaviour.

I believe you said you were rather young. There are other people who are like you, and have made it out and are doing ok all things considered. Worst case scenario, you can do whatever you have to do, to survive, and once you get out from under thier thumb, you can starting working to undo all the damage they caused. It's going to suck, and it will be unpleasant. But you can do it. It's not fair, or right. But that's the way things are. It shouldn't be, but it is. People are just awful sometimes, but people can also be really good. I'm sure there is a great community, waiting for you, ready to welcome and accept and support you. You just have to get there.

No matter what happens, they can't take what you are away from you. You can call yourself whatever is necessary to thier face. That does not prevent you from calling yourself, thinking of yourself as whatever you want in your mind. If you have a teacher at school, that you really really trust, consider asking them for help or support or advice. If you have someone who has been supportive of you they might be able to help somehow.

I don't know what it's like to be a member of the lgbt community or to be in the situation you are in because of that, but i do know what it's like to have parents that make your life more unpleasant. I know that it sucks, and they don't deserve to have what they do. They don't deserve to have as wonderful of a person/child as you. Someone like you, is completely wasted in thier hands. And their never going to realize any of it, unless they do when it's far too late.

For all the shit my parents did, as ""great"" of an attempt as they made to teach me anything at all, at the very least, i have an appartment, where i get to make the rules, and i only really have to see my parents if i want to. I had to work my ass off at a factory job, but i suppose things are alright all things considered. Stuff is good enough, and i suppose i'm happy enough, and it's certainly better than it was. I sucked getting to where i am now, and i went to college for a degree i'm not really using (yay). Point is, my parents fucked up a lot of stuff, and i fucked up some stuff, and i and my situation are still mostly ok.

You can make it. You can make things the way you want them to be. I sure things probably suck right now, but that doesn't mean thier going to suck forever.

I hope things turn out as good as they can for you. That doesn't mean things are going to be perfect, but I hope for the best outcome you can have. I hope your parents realize the mistake they made, right after you're free, and it's too late to do anything about it, and they spend the rest of thier lives honestly trying to make up for what they did. And if they don't, fuck 'em. They aren't worth it anyways.

History is full of people who were what they wanted to be, and they rest of the world was too stuborn to admit it, and that didn't stop those people from making the life they wanted to have. If it takes you however long to set things right, either by getting away, or exposing them for what they are, you'll still have plenty of time after, to make the life you want to have. In the grand scheme of things, this all is just a big ugly awful speed/road bump. Once you're past it, you can make things better for yourself. All you've got to do now, is get past it. By whatever means you can.

(I do appologize for this being so long)
Call the cops on your parents for mental abuse
I'm being realistic. Why haven't you done anything, and why does it take a random stranger on the internet to tell you.
Yes. OP needs to do this.
don’t worry, i have a few copies in different places
And give copies to their therapist/counselor/other trusted adults. Spread the copies around so yote parents can't easily destroy the evidence
Yes
Absolutely. They can't take away your phone, not let you sleep in your bedroom, mistreat you, nor force you to detransition. Everything they're doing to you IS illegal and you have to contact someone, like the police, and they WILL help you.
I’m in the U.S and completely unfamiliar with UK law but I’ve been a foster mom and mandated reporter and where I live it would absolutely be considered abuse. I would call your local gender center from a friend or trusted teacher’s phone. See if they can help you find legal representation and guide you on how to fight this.
[removed]
I'm in the UK and my barrister friend says abuse and assault both in play. The contract is proof of their intent so get it or a copy before you bug out.

Social workers can't be relied upon as the framework they work in is very weak so it comes down to the individual case worker and their interpretation. Her suggestion is to get in touch with a trans charity any will help even if it's just passing you to a more suitable group. 

Very Important: This isn't you doing anything wrong, bad, or evil. It is about your parents putting conditions on their love and acceptance of you which is wrong. If you don't act now, and I know it's terrifying, it will get worse until you finally break. That tends to be when you kill yourself.

Have you any friends or relatives who could help you today while you sort out things long term?  Hell if you're within reach of Nottingham I've got a comfy couch and a cat you can fuss, she's a bit of an attention whore TBH.
So My veiw that abusing trans people is insignificant? And i am objectively incorrect?
As far as I’m aware the only free ones are wholesome, silver, helpful, and bear hug
Sure, but I'm also going to leave a comment for the lurkers who might agree

Well here’s a chance to give your new son a new name that means just as much to you! But it kind of depends on what you mean when you say “waiting until 18” does that mean waiting until 18 to medically transition, or does that include harmless stuff like allowing him to change his presentation and name and such
Who you named your child after is irrelevant (& kind insulating to your kid), your kid is not them, your kid is not a copy of them. Your kid deserves to be their own person with their own identity.
What country are you in? I’ll find some resources for parents to help you understand better. 
When your child experiences gender dysphoria it can be debilitating to the point they are sometimes suicidal so this is quite serious. Having you support him to become himself would be the most incredible thing a parent could do. It could prevent years if suffering. 
Let me know and I’ll send you legitimate resources that can help you.
Gonna be honest I don’t really care. You didn’t do the smallest amount of research into this when your son came out. You just decided that clearly he would regret it so fuck his happiness.
I had a similar thing but I managed to get out of it. Plus as soon As I turn 18 it’s off to Deutschland for university and hopefully the rest of life the laws they got there protecting people like us are truly amazing

thank you you sweet sweet human. i am working something out, i’m sure it will be fine
This is rude and we all should be supportive, especially since OP is a minor
There are reasons someone will take some time to react, and need some help or/and support! Do not criticise you are not in their position!
its only going to get worse dude, time to get out now, dont let them waste more of your life.
You might consider a friend holding a copy too or that sort of thing. 

Your parents are evil. This is unbelievably messed up. 

I don’t know what to do legally, even less so given you’re in the UK, but if at worst you have to play along with them until you’re older, you are still valid. You are still who you are, and none of these things change that, even if you have to play along with them for your safety. 

I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. Please do not hurt yourself or take this out on yourself. You are valid and you’re doing nothing wrong.
But the OP did mention that he lives in the UK, trans protection is absolute dogshit there.
[removed]
yeah did my whole gcse speaking endorsement on trans conversion therapy its genuinely disgusting that its still legal
 domestic abuse is not legal
[deleted]
Mental conversion therapy for under 18 is now illegal in the UK
Ye not with that contract, there isn’t any situation in witch that can be put under conversion therapy.
It's not legal to force a minor to sign a contract under the threat of unfair treatment and losing basic things. It's also domestic abuse, which certainly isn't legal.
I’m also in the uk, and child abuse is child abuse regardless of context so is therefore illegal, but yeah Bojos stance on CT (which they admit in the consultation documents does not work and is harmful!) is the reason why I’m still not out, I live in a blue county and it’s killing me having to hide who I am still.
Good, you could additionally send them to a person you trust. That way your parents will never get rid of the evidence.
It’s up to OP to decide how much danger they are in, that’s why I provided multiple numbers.

I've always told him (first time using that pronoun) he can present as anything he likes. And I have  his back no matter what permanent changes she wants as an adult. I guess I just fear her changing her mind later in life and asking me why I let him do it.
no that’s the most annoying but both sides of my family are immensely conservative so there isn’t a single person that i’m aware of who supports me
Look at you, literally advocating for suppressing LGBTQ+ identities because… why exactly?
THIS
They wouldn’t. In the uk getting sent to the mental health ward aka being sectioned is an extremely last option thing. Op has no reason to need to be sectioned. Despite what you seem to think, the UK is for the majority accepting. It is required you are for heath care  jobs. To be sectioned, your case must be reviewed by a doctor, the person wanting to admit you, a psychiatrist and if the police are involved, the police. Most likely Op, you will not end up getting sectioned, im here for you :)
No they wouldn't. Even in the US. 

I'm a mandatory reporter. CYS/CPS investigates and if they have concerning findings they contact the police. They also try to find family that can take the kid in or have emergency foster placement.

It is a shit situation. Don't make it worse by spreading false info.
Sometimes being rude gets people moving. To achieve, you need to go outside your comfort zone. Just being supportive isn't good enough, you need to tell some people to get them going.

People will disagree with this opinion, and I understand that. However, at the end of the day, I am thinking with OP in mind and do worry for their wellbeing.
Forcing your kid to conform to your wishful thinking of what they should be is abusive no matter the subject at hands
it's one of the things which is protected enough for it to be illegal

also some of those things are just not legal in general, without even being trans
Actually children in most countries do have property rights.


If you give your child a console or phone, it's theirs.
This is bullshit. The country doesn't give you mental support even if you need it...

They aren't frotning 3 years of mental hospital stay for someone that isn't mentally unwell.
but conversion therapy isn't. and since all of these demands have almost exclusively to do with being trans, it seems like it could easily be spun as legal through the legality of conversion therapy.
domestic abuse is illegal, but conversion therapy isn't (and trans people aren't nearly as ""protected"" as the phrase would imply). considering this, i think that it could easily be spun to be legal, since almost all of the demands made could fall within the bounds of conversion therapy, which is not legally considered abuse and thus is legal, and will likely continue to be legal against trans people.
[removed]
i hate doing this but... source? because as of my knowledge, the UK government hasn't yet made any legislative motion to ban conversion therapy other than simply stating that it will do so, and even so, they're only planning on banning conversion therapy based on sexuality, not gender identity, despite the fact that the opposition, and even quite a few tory MPs, are constantly saying they should ban it completely
That depends. It certainly seems like it shouldn't be, but that certainly doesn't mean it necessarily counts as child abuse in the eyes of the law. In the end, it all comes down to precedent. Or just who has the best lawyer.
yeah, it does suck. then again, blue counties aren't all as horrible as they seem, at least from my experience living out in great yarmouth (tory safe seat, currently held by brandon lewis), but then again, i'm also a shut-in who never leaves her room, and i do often get misgendered (not in an aggressive way but still) by people who only know me as emilia, showing at best a low level of understanding, and at worst a lack of respect, so i can't really say it's the best.
Agree. This is the way. You do not deserve this, and your parents are behaving in a horrific manner. You have to look out for yourself. Stay strong.

Detransition is extremely rare, I’ve heard numbers like less than 1% of the community detransitions voluntarily. And in those situations it normally seems like they’re transitioning for the wrong reasons. In your son’s case, if it’s something he’s expressed interest in for 2 years at this point, it could be a good chance to let him experiment with presentation and identity. Nothing permanent has to be done until you’re both comfortable with it
What about friends and their families, that’s what I ended up doing for a while then my mother finally kinda came to terms
Yeah I see your point but tough love never worked on me. We gotta build their confidence up! Or else they might not even ask for help in the future

Edit: changed 'Have' to 'yeah' and 'in' to 'on.' Lol new phone
that is true, but we are talking legality here. no matter what we think, the state has the final say, especially in these urgent situations.
this is domestic abuse

and you  are  facilitating  it   with you   transphobic  assertions
One of the few things I hate about the UK

I did some searching and what you wrote is all I found. No law on the books yet. Along with what you wrote, they also aren't banning it for anyone over 18 who consents or is coerced into having it.

You are correct. Confidence is an important building block to sustaining the resistance against those who hate you for existing.
Correct me if I'm wrong but to my knowledge is child abuse not legal in the UK. Sure the state has a final say but I'd say op has a pretty solid case
do you think i like this? do you think i enjoy living in this fucking hellhole of country just because i point out how fucked it is? 

Whether you, i, or anyone else likes it, the law doesn't define abuse based on what you feel is abusive, and domestic abuse is very easy to spin as just ""an alternative form of parenting"" especially since conversion therapy's legality means that the law won't necessarily recognise any of this behaviour as abusive, no matter how abhorrent we know it is.
They never said that it WASN'T transphobia. They explained the UK context wherein conversion therapy for trans is allowed authorities may not see it as abuse but an attempt at conversion therapy thereby siding with the parents.

Me explaining that does not excuse it, defend it, or in any way shape or form justify conversion therapy. It is absolutely barbaric. But this is something the OP may need to consider in crafting a plea for help to accentuate the abusive elements vis-à-vis the demands for detransitioning (which is to an extent legal over there with additional complications when involving a minor). 

So you got two forces at play: the abuse of the parents, and the legality of conversion therapy in the UK with the added shittiness of legal guardianship of a minor.
You shouldn't judge someone trying to see the context to understand the problem, this person isn't being transphobic. Stop being inclusive, that's the total opposite idea of what we are talking about here. The goal is to help someone in need, not sending this someone to a worst scenario, jeez...
Yes but in the UK the police allow domestic abuse as long as the abuser calls it conversion therapy.

That's the point.
She's not being transphobic tho??????
[removed]
It’s probably not illegal but it may be illegal to force a person to de transition
Fair enough. It's a foolish, but common, mistake to think the government will actually do what it says its going to do, and I wouldn't blame you for making it.

It sounds like you may have one now! I wish you luck though I know it’s a hard situation. I’d say just try to work with them and do what you’re comfortable with. As scary as the idea is that they’ll do something they regret, there’s also the opposite that they miss out on stuff by not doing it
Thanks for confirming  you endorse domestic violence.
No they do not .

Stop being a transphobic liar and child abuser.

One of the arguments  that is being used against  a conversion  therapy ban is that coercive  control like this is all ready illegal
Absolutely  is  claiming that it's legal because  conversion  therapy isn't a criminal offence. 

This is domestic abuse and coercive control which Absolutely  are criminal matters.
Said with all the confidence of a new account.

I heard anyone who ever loved you was wrong. That was the smartest person who told me that. A great person.  The best. Simply tremendous.
There's no written law in place to say that's the case, so that would come down to precedent, or, if there is no precedent, it would come down to who has the best lawyer.
They're all rich, cis/het white men, they are not ever going to fully understand how we feel.
[removed]
Go spread your hate somewhere else, you are on the attacker side here
Im not saying that's 100% the case, however I'm explaining that the law is not often so cute and dry, and cases like these can be incredibly slippery, especially if you know how to twist the truth and the law in your favour. I'm not saying that it's OK because it's legal, or vice versa. I'm saying that the world is cruel, and the law doesn't always work the way we think it should, so just calling the police and hoping for the best is not always a viable option.
Try reading it again; she's saying that it could be *spun as* conversion therapy to get out of legal repercussions, not that it's in any way morally acceptable.
I’d argue that it is neglecting a child’s access to health care. 
In Australia we work under UK common law and sometimes when they are about to implement a law they stop prosecuting under the current rules even though it’s not fully in writing yet. 
Sadly I’ve read the conversation laws in the uk don’t cover trans people which is disgusting.
I wouldn't necessarily say that about the whole of parliament, in fact most of parliament wants to ban conversion therapy entirely, but the prime minister really doesn't, and most of the tory party are too busy sucking him off (sometimes literally) to give a shit.
[removed]
Really  ? 

I'm not the person telling the OP that  the abuse they are receiving from their parents is acceptable , and that  it's conversion therapy but it's ok because it isn't banned.

Give your head a wobble transphobe...
oh, you do not want to get into the uk's terrible trans healthcare. anyway, this is specifically relating to social transition, as it doesn't seem like OP has started medical transition yet, as may be a different story (though i wouldn't count on it)
I agree, but there's still a critical lack of representation in parliament.
The whole point is that we're saying it's not acceptable, but it is legal and that's what we're disgusted with.... Well and you but still
>I'm not the person telling the OP that the abuse they are receiving from their parents is acceptable

They didn't say this.

>and that it's conversion therapy but it's ok because it isn't banned.

They didn't say this.

In fact they stated this VVVV a whole 9 hours before you posted the above -

>the law won't necessarily recognise any of this behaviour as abusive, *no matter how abhorrent we know it is*.

So its clear they dont think the whole thing is ok, and you are clearly *choosing* to have a bad faith interpretation.

Stating that something isn't a crime ≠ endorsing that action

Waking granny up with an airhorn is probably legal, but we can all agree its a shitty thing to do.

Conversion therapy has been a hot issue in the UK recently, and it is being actively kept legal by the government despite popular opposition. That doesn't mean people think that's ok, but it does mean that *conversion therapy* specifically is not illegal. It isn't considered abusive, regardless of the fact that we all know it is.

Should it be illegal? Yes.

Is stating that it currently isn't, transphobic? No.

Not that any of that matters as the contract is in no way legal in the first place. You're punching in the wrong direction, and it isn't helping anyone here, you, OP and the rest of the community included.
Everyone already explained that isn't what they said and you're still freaking the fuck out. Calm down and think for half a second

And quit throwing around the word transphobe at non transphobic people. It ruins the word asshat
yep, i can definitely agree with that, though it's nothing compared to the uk supreme court (albeit that the way the supreme court are selected means that being old is kinda a given and becoming more diverse would first require the field of law to become more diverse, so it's understandable that diversity in the supreme court is a few decades behind)
They're supposed to represent the general public lmao.
I'm aware. But at least the government is transparent. In the UK, we kinda take for granted that we can just read about or watch almost all of the proceedings of parliament, sometimes live or even in person, and all for free at that. Our government sucks, but at least we have access to all of the info we need to know exactly how they suck

So cute!
You both have lovely curls! 😍

Both beautiful!
Thank you! U look amazing as well!
This is really sweet. A lot of people have commented since childhood that I look like my mother, and I always took pride in that. Now you’ve inspired me to look through the massive treasure trove of family photos I have and see if there’s anyone else I resemble.
So classy and cute! I LOVE it 💙💗🤍💗💙
Strong genes. You're both beautiful ladies with great hair
Naw, you got your own nailed down.
I recommend you check out r/curlyhair!
Generations came for you and gave you beauty
Back then women would frequently visit the salon to get these types of dos, so don't feel so bad.
love a throwback. it's in your heritage mama!
You look so much like her! You're both gorgeous, and that hairstyle looks so pretty on you!
Wow! You really do look just like her!
She was so pretty and so are you

Thanks you are very kind!
Thank you! U are so kind :)
Thank you so much!
I know she'd think her granddaughter is a seriously beautiful girl, who inherited some fiiiine genetic code!
A brief scroll through your recent comments clearly shows you're posting in bad faith. It's kind of pathetic
Thank you!
This seems like a great sub actually. Thank you!
Yea my grandma isnt trans but i thought i had a cool resemblance!
The top few things I learned from there: no sulphates ever, shampoo every few days but condition every day, pat hair dry (don’t ruffle it up) and like lean over and push your curls into your hair with a towel. Those were a total game changer for me.
You definitely do ☺️"	nx4yb2	trans	3742	0.98	2021-06-11 02:18:52
My boss / coworker has a trans daughter, and I absolutely ADORE his enthusiasm about the subject.	"I was working yesterday with this guy - a super kind dude - and he was telling me about his kids.

He explained, ""I got two kids. And, I'm still learning, but one of them is transgender. And she always teaching me stuff. I really support that stuff, I really wanna support my kids.""

So, I looked at him, held up my pride lanyards (one gay flag, one trans flag) and said, ""Well, if you have any questions you can ask me, because I'm trans, too."" Enter in the shock and the 'I had no idea's, as I pass 100%, nowadays.

Then, to my surprise, he started absolutely *gushing* about his daughter to me, showing me pictures, talking about the hormones he's buying her, about how he's always learning, she's always teaching him. Because, as he explained, there were three main reasons he is so adamant about support:

* He used to be very homophobic, as he said he was in a gang and that's just how people thought. He said that's the old him, and the new him ain't like that.
* In the black community, he said it's real dangerous and frowned upon - ""and it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be at all"" he told me - so he wants to make sure his daughters are loved and safe.
* Because he has complete custody over them, alone, he wants them to grow up safe and strong and knowing that they're loved.

It made me want to cry. I kept telling him, ""You're such an amazing parent. You're such a good person."" Since there are so many of us that are alone, or feel alone, especially when it comes to family, I wanted him to understand how much I appreciate what he's doing. This guy just made me *so damn happy.* He cares so *much* about his kids.

Of course, he's trying his best, and he apparently texted his daughter something like, ""I met a transgender at work!"" To which she told him, ""Actually, dad, use transgender PERSON. But awesome!"" Or something like that, you know?

And he was so *excited* to show me his mistake, saying, ""Education is so important. It's so important to keep learning.""

When I told him that I'm happy he supports this trans girl, he asked, ""So when you say 'trans girl' you mean...someone like my daughter?""

I explained, ""It's just like when you have 'boy' and 'girl', only you're tacking on 'trans'. They're still boys and girls."" Right?

He was *elated,* like, ""Oh I get it! See, that's so important to know!""

I adore this man. He's trying his best, of *course* he isn't perfect, but just seeing him trying and wanting to keep his daughters happy and safe gave me fucking *life.* In a world where I always fear trans kids have to grow up alone, knowing this teenager is loved and accepted by her father is the greatest thing.

Anyways...I just really wanted to share this. It was so wholesome.

**EDIT: Aw man, I'm so glad I ain't the only one who was just** ***hype*** **with happiness / near crying at this! Hope everyone is doing okay! <3**"	"this is so wholesome
That's so wholesome It makes me want to cry. I wish the world had more parents like him in it
this made me cry lol
I'm actually crying. Tell this blessed man he gives hope to all the tiny trans people in your phone haha
I really enjoyed reading that, thanks for sharing!
[deleted]
It's awesome to read something so positive, thank you for sharing!
I squealed when reading this post. This is so freaking cute!!
That dad is a Saint! 

I'm so afraid of my environment if I eventually do decide to transition, they will react badly. But maybe I'm the real transphobe...
Lord, this is more wholesome than a quart of fresh milk! 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Thank you for sharing! That was incredible.
This post is turning so many people into waterfalls…this post is so bitter sweet to a lot of us. I hope we all can find someone as encouraging as this father.
This needs to go on r/wholesome and r/mademesmile
That’s so amazing!
Oh I needed to see this today, glad to see there are amazing people out there!
Man, I wish my parents or brother were half as enthusiastic. Anything that's hard or they don't like, they'll just say, ""I'm old"" or ""I love you so you shouldn't be upset,"" instead of trying to learn about the community, our experience, or change behavior when told something it's harmful or phobic. 

Nonetheless,  I'm still happy for her - her father is a blessing and may they stay close 💜🏳️‍🌈
Bless him.
Oh my god this is so cuteeeeeee
What an awesome person, if only everyone could think like him!
Hes a legend and the kind of parent any LGBTQ kid needs
chills and tears welling rn tbh
This is just the most wholesome thing. Thank you for sharing!
This is so wholesome it made me want to cry
My heart is going pitter patter pitter patter and it’s getting really warm in there. We need more parents like this, that are excited to learn more, get educated and more open. Not a lot of parents are like that, most of the time they tend to draw back and be more closed off even if they consider themselves open. In my experience it’s not easy to teach a parent when they live by the idea that “I was born first and am older so I know more than you” or “well it’s not like that back in my day and I never knew about it so I don’t think it’s that great. It’s just a trend anyway and you don’t know who you are.” I appreciate parents like him who are so ready to actually care for their kids and learn from them to make it better for them. Bless his soul and his entire heart and family
This is my motivation for the day. I'm glad there are parents out there like this. It makes me so happy!!!
You've got a great friend! I adore how wholesome this is!
I’m crying on the bus now. This was so lovely
We need more people like this
Damn.

This post made me want a good dad. I didn’t know they existed like this 😢🥺
Can he be my dad? 🥺
I

Am

Crying
Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this.
I have not been feeling great and I needed this. Please more of this on this sub.
This is so sweet ahhh Im tearing up omg
What I'd give to have my parents be like this...
I needed this today. My mom chewed me out for forty minutes straight last night about disliking my transition and this was after a half hour of right wing covid propaganda... I'm 23, I'm an adult, I hate that she feels she has the right to do that. So seeing someone actually be a supportive and caring parent for their trans child is refreshing. Thank you for the dopamine hit today. Wishing you and his family the best.
I love that omg what a brilliant dad
Thank you so much for sharing this!!! I’m a ‘new mom’ of a 23 year old daughter and this is making me so so happy. Thank you
i love this sooo much.  i love that he is sooo happy about learning and he cares and wants to make sure he does the right thing.
Hey, who's cutting onions? 😭
I have a coworker similar to this! He's an older white man, and while he doesn't have a trans child, he does get attached to younger coworkers in a really supportive ""fatherly"" way. Two trans people work there, one being me, and he's always trying to research and learn about trans stuff. Always trying to make sure he's referring to us in ways that we're comfortable with, and apologizing for any mistakes, though his mistakes don't hurt as bad because he actually puts genuine effort towards it. He's a serious sweetheart! ♥️
Fuck, now I’m crying
There’s nothing more uplifting than a person telling you they support the trans community before they know you’re a part of it. Because people will obviously tell you how they’re supportive after they know, almost to the point that it can seem insincere.  But your boss realistically didn’t know how you would respond to hearing about his trans daughter and he told you how proud he was of her anyway.  Great guy.
Aww he sounds like a great parent. If he’s on FB, there’s an educational group called “You Might Wanna Learn More About Trans People” that he might benefit from joining. Everyone is welcome there and he can ask questions if he has any and get answers from trans and nonbinary folks with lived experience.
We need more parents these like these
🎼💕🎶❤
Awww 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Definitely not crying...
I was really worried about my boss at work, who is an opinionated older white woman (who could easily be a terf, she gives off those kinds of vibes) but when I came out to her she literally said ""that's great! My granddaughter is trans. Do you need any help finding places that stock cute shoes in your size?"" 😍

Enthusiastic trans ally bosses are the best!
All the hugs for this guy!!
I *love* parents like that!

He may not know all the terms yet, he may not know the best way to say things yet, but he’s enthusiastically supportive, and willing to learn and fix his mistakes.

What a wonderful ally and support his daughter has!
omg 🥺🥺🥺 good dad alert 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

this is something I emphasize to any of my cis friends when they ask questions or are confused: it's always okay to grow. if you don't know something, then you just don't know, but as long as you're open to learning and growth then you'll do alright in this world
this is one of the sweetest stories I've read ever ;u;
I love parents who are accepting of thier LGBT+ kids
What a great person!  That's true love and curiosity at its best and made my day!
I'm crying reading this. I have never met this man but I would die to keep him safe. What an absolute gem.
whatever smiling and weeping at the same time is called that’s me
Someone so enthusiastic to learn and grow who cares so much. Oh it makes my heart soar.

His daughter is so, so lucky.
Omg, reading this made me cry. This beautiful person, bending in the wind as he learns, and being so enthusiastic about learning about his daughter’s transition, and walking with her…I want to hug him. I want to hug his neck and tell him that he’s the parent we all deserve. Mine are supportive, but not enthusiastic like this. And for him to cone from the background he came from…he is a truly beautiful person. Thank you for sharing.
My kiddo (13) came out to my wife and me as non-binary recently. While it was a bit of a shock, we are doing everything we can to support them because they’re our child and we love them more than anything in the world. I don’t understand a parent who would do otherwise, it makes no sense at all.

That being said, love you all here and if you need a dumb gen X dad to tell you that you’re wonderful just as you are, I’m here for you.
Holy moly that’s some serious love. We love to see it
Omg I'm in tears that's so adorable and great! I wish every trans*person could have a dad like him <3
I really love this. ❤️
I fucking love this. Give your boss my regards, and tell him this trans girl would love to have him as a father.
Aww that’s so wonderful ❤️ trans kids need parents like that it touches my heart 😭
This is so so so amazing, hearing him so excited to learn and being so proud and excited for his daughter is just amazing! She's one lucky kid and I'm glad he's your boss!!!
“No man is an island entire of itself”, and this man makes the whole so much more wholesome.

I hope this man lives another 50 years at least, because the minute he’s gone it’ll be like an entire continent sank into the sea.
I want to hug this precious man. I'm so happy for his daughter, and his children in general that they have such a good father, and I'm so happy for you that your boss is so amazing.
I'm going to cry this is so wholesome
literally my mum
I wish my dad was this enthusiastic about me being Trans🥺
I absolutely adore hearing about awesome parents like this!
i LOVE the fact that hes so excited to show that he made a mistake and learned from it. most people (especially transphobes) are just too scared of making a mistake, so when they do make one, they pretend that they are right and really just make the situation so much worse. the fact that he is willingly talking about his mistakes and how he evolved from them is just so heartwarming
Dude show him all these lovely responses he got on this post, he gotta know that what he’s doing is not taken for granted and that he’s fucking acing this parenting thing!
I wish I had a Dad like that and not one on the complete opposite end. It woulda helped me transition at a way younger age and/or at least be confident in who I am.
Parents like this really give me hope. Supportive and proud parents of trans kids, you're fighting against the tide and doing amazing.
Hi hornies
ugh
[removed]
wholesomeee
Such wholesome tears running down my face!

His curiosity and love are so beautiful to exist at all, and to have been able to read about and experience it; it is so lovely to know that there are people out there so utterly loved and cared for.

I wish we could have all of such curiosity to withhold judgment about things we do not *yet* understand and the empathy and love to fully take them all in.

May they all have as much happiness as they can hold.
This makes me so incredibly happy. Shit, I'm crying.
Please tell this amazing man, that he's giving many of us so much hope that it's to meet people who are supportive.
my dad couldve really learned something from that guy😭thats so sweet
A late comment but please keep us updated on him if something else happens, I wanna learn about what he learns!!
This is how it should be.
Now you see, it's people like him, he's why we CAN have nice things!

\+1 Faith in Humanity
Well now I’m crying. I wish I had parents like this.
This is so adorable I actually teared up a bit. I would've given anything for a dad like that.
Yo can we clone this guy?
I'm glad he is so big on it.  Even accepting parents can have their negative moments and that sticks with you, so seeing that he's both positive and willing to learn is awesome.  I've had to remind people a time or two that their child/cousin/sibling/whatever is still their child/cousin/sibling/whatever no matter their gender.
This is literally all we want. 99% of days I deal with my mom’s transphobia I say I want to cut her out of my life completely but on the 1%, I’m just so sad and lost and I realize… God I wish my mom would just love me. I wish her love wasn’t so transactional in that I have to be everything she wants me to be for her to smile at me and love me and be there for me. I wish she would help me and support me and realize that I’m just happier this way and be happy for me. It’s so fucking hard, so so so fucking hard to go through it by myself without a parent’s reassurance. Sure, you can have a partner, a best friend, a good support system in spite of all estrangement but sometimes not having a parent support you just hits different…
Lowkey dad of the year... I applaud that he's trying to learn and be more accepting and mature than his former self.
This made my day
If we were all like this man the world would be a better place. I hope he's doing well :]
Meanwhile my parents:

Look, I know you won't get it right 100% of the time right away and that's okay, just put in an effort, okay? That's all I'm asking for.

What? No we can't POSSIBLY do that, this is asking WAY too much, this is all so complicated oh by the way deadname, why do you seem to never talk to us?
Wholesome parent posts really are a bright shining light these days
Protect this man at all costs
I cry every time I hear a story like this. It makes me so happy that fewer and fewer trans kids have to go through what I did.
Awwww this makes me so happy!!🥺 Wish more people were like him!
I wish I had parents like these so I don’t need to continue to hide in fear
He sounds so sweet!
I want to hug him and his daughter🥺🥺
* waves and points to himself* I'm trying to be like him.
It's so wholesome it DID make me cry 😭
Dude, I was getting all teary-eyed in the middle of my shift haha.
same lol made my day
Same here and I seldom cry from positive feelings. This makes me so incredibly happy!
I absolutely *will* tell him! <3
Of course! :D
Right? I'm thinking of telling him, the next time I see him, that I made an anonymous post about him. Show him everyone's comments and stuff. Because I think it may make him happy to know just how *awesome* he is in everyone's eyes, now.
Absolutely, no problem!
No, no, that's a valid fear. I know so many people that are terrified to come out or begin transitioning, even in adulthood and living on their own / away from parents, because the fear of abandonment or being hated by those who supposedly love you just *hurts.* So, you have every right to be afraid, in my opinion.

Hope things get easier for you. <3
Of course! It was absolutely amazing, so I just really wanted to share it with everyone!
Hopefully that's a good ""ugh""? I'm sorry, I hope this didn't upset you. I just really wanted to share some positivity.
I mean, homie, I perused through your posts. I know you're seemingly for right-wing political values. You don't need to disguise your trolling as actual concern, you can come out and say, ""I'm transphobic."" It's totally okay, sweetie.
Same here!!!
You're a great parent then!
Same here same 😂

And he’s helped a mom too
And you did, to use your words that gave me fucking *life* :D

"Just got called ""love"" by postman, happy trans noise🥰"		"(Wait) Oh yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman
(Wait) Wa-a-a-ait, Mr. Postman 🎶
I'll kinda miss being called cute names once I go on T. People do it less frequently with men. I always thought it was a nice thing. Of course within reason. When it was only for the purpose of hitting on me in a tasteless way, that was annoying. But that's really a different issue.
Especially in Germany people don't really call men cute names. Ah well. But I'll take that over dysphoria lol.
I'm really happy the postman made your day with this simple little word. 🥰
You also look lovely, btw.
FWIW, I call everyone honey, love or gorge.  I'm just some random trans woman though, not a post person.
Unrelated but ur so prettyyyyy That dress really suits you and im sure it really does well the spinny spinny
Love that for you! And I love the fit! ❤️
I love the outfit!
Adorable outfit, adorable doggo and adorable vibe. You love are 3/3 on the adorable pass check ✔️
You’re super cute, plus a springer!
I read that as “happy trains noises” and thought of u going choo choo
Got called 'darling' by a friendly guy at the new bagel shop near work. He even continued using feminine pronouns despite my deep monotone voice!

Coincidentally, it's my first time wearing a bra to work (pre-HRT, so no actual boobs yet). I feel at ease.
Aww thats such a nice dress!

And a nice doggo!
Woohoo luv the dress
[deleted]
I think it could be because… you are cute AF love! And so is ur doggo and I love your outfit xo
I hear you! To this day I still get a buzz when in these everyday situations I'm addressed as love, miss, ma'am, sweetie, mama, etc lol
that dress is the cutest! where did you get it??
Whoop whoooop
OMG that dress is so cute
You and your dog are both so cute!
Such a cute outfit! You and your buddy there are both looking lovely! 💖
You are very lovely
<3
Wait is that not a normal thing to say?
Yes! Love this for you. I have the same thing when an old northern man calls me “pal” 😂
You can get love from this postal lady
Nice 👍🏻
You’re so prettyyy 🥺👉👈

And also I love your dog
I’m sorry, I just need to know. Where did you get that dress???
love
That's nice to hear love
Sweet! Today I also received a package and the FedEx guy was so sweet too and calling me ""señorita"". You know, I had a song in my head all day because of that :3, so yay for euphoria on passing, congrats UwU.
That's such a cute outfit. I wanna scratch the puppers ears!
Aw yay! I love little moments like that 😍
Aww yay! Also you look beautiful! I love that dress.
Awww that's so adorable
Hooray!
I'm FtM and so desperate to be acknowledged as male that I have seriously considered making my legal first name ""Sir"". Congratulations for passing so well.
You look nice!
i love your outfit!
Congrats! AlsoI love springer spaniels too, they are so cute!!! 😍
Wow you’re super cute no wonder 🥰
Both you and your dog are adorable <3
Aww that’s so noice, just wondering what would your happy noise be tho? Mine is a loud screech to scare away anyone who would dare ruin my happiness, out of fear of what my capabilities are.
i get the same feeling whenever i get called pal :)
You! It was you in the dress that got me to buy it! Hell bunny makes such good stuff! You look adorable! And such a sweet puppers!
🥰❤️
Aww someone beat me to it
Very good.
Thanks too kind🥰 and hopefully you get some compliments soon x
Come to the UK midlands, most people, male or female get referred to as 'pet' or 'duck' frequently here
I think that’s partly a cultural thing that people are not apt to call men cute names but it’s also due to another cultural thing, men aren’t allowed and encouraged to be cute
I’ve always had the tendency to call usually older women “love”, as a boy, and have been doing it more into my transition. I recently did what I sometimes do and forgot I’m not visibly fem yet and called a guy love and got a very uncomfortable stare back lol. Idk but men, myself (pre cracking) included seem very uncomfortable with them. I sometimes see men with like cool shoes and wanna say “nice trainer dude”, but never do in fear of awkwardness. I used to wish I got compliments as a dude and hopefully if I pass I’ll be able to give a lot more out. My New Year’s resolution is to compliment strangers.
> Especially in Germany people don't really call men cute names.

Out of curiosity: Personally I am too shy to do this with anyone unless I know them well enough to be resonably certain they won't take it the wrong way, and I have not witnessed cute-naming irl in 35 years. So: It actually does happen? In Germany, I mean? How and where? The most I (amab) get is really bright open smiles from the four cashiers whose faces I recognize. One may be gay, one may be ace, and they all are probably just very cheery people, right? (Can't be me committing the error of fundamental attribution, that would be plain silly ... /s).

And I was sitting here wondering what it is with English-speaking countries that people be so openly affectionate? Or maybe this is just me, looking through a glass darkly.

Anyway,

> May you grow up to stand as a man, love

> With the pride of your family and name

> When you lay down your head, or to rest in your bed

> May you stay in the arms of the angels

Gorge? Like the water thing...not heard that before x

Mad half an hour with this one ;) x
Love my doggo to pieces🥰
Springer spaniel indeed :) your parents have good taste x
Way too kind! Made me smile and doggo says thnx as well x
Hellbunny darling, they have loads of colours and sizes x
Oh yes, the UK handles it so much differently. I lived in the UK for about 6 months as an au pair once. In London.
Half of the people there were really lovely. The other half was a little intimidating and made me feel like I had to sit straight and go to my room to revise my french 😬
Talking about the midlands and their ways - I had a time when I was really into watching Hollyoaks. I loved everybody's accents and thought it gave them an instant vibe of ""I am friendly and cuddly"" :D
I can't really access BBC programmes anymore tho and I'm too broke to afford a VPN. Ah well. Would be way too much to catch up on now anyway.
Idk if my little sub self could frequently be called pet 😳
Women might call each other ""Süße"", ""Schatz"", ""Liebes"". But those are friends or close acquaintances.
Some women call men ""Schatz"" or ""Hase"".
But people are individuals and we don't all fit into the gender binary nonsense.
I call everyone ""Hase"" or ""Schatz"" when I feel like it - and I don't think I'm gonna stop doing it just because I start taking hormones.
I think gorge like gorgeous
Like short for gorgeous.  Maybe it's a regional thing?
Spaniels are such fluffy idiots!
Ty ty ty I love theeeeeeseeeee
As someone from the black country, I always laugh whenever someone watches a show like doctors or hollyhoaks and comes out with the result of ""nice accent"", we sound like dwarves! Lmao
So my bff is Australian- so I've known him for 5 years. Well, when we first met I thought he was British. Regardless, now, I can't even hear the accent - it's like he's American T-T
Ahh thnx for explaining x
Lol, definitely not 'hoarhay', as per Spanish pronunciation of gorge 😆😂

My father disowned me. He lost a thriving and happy daughter.		"Your father doesn’t know what he is missing. Children are a blessing. They are meant to be loved unconditionally. I’m so sorry that your father failed on his end of the relationship. That is not how parents are supposed to act. I know because I am one. You are a treasure! Don’t ever forget that❤️🤗
One of us. One of us. His loss is our gain.
I’m sorry. I feel yea. My family did the same thing. It get better I promise. :)
A. That is his loss unfortunately, B. Hopefully there will be a change in future, it doesn't have to be forever as attitudes and opinions can change - and I hope they do.
Damn right he did that jerk. I wish you nothing but the best 😊
I’m so sorry sister.  It’s really awful but sadly quite common for us to lose family.

I’ve got family problems as well.  It started out with the most transphobic comments and moved to lies feigning acceptance because my mother wants to see the grandkids. My father (not with my mother) claimed acceptance but I haven’t seen him in a year and he hasn’t been able to visit because he magically gets sick every holiday.  I told him the other day that our relationship is over if he isn’t willing to visit.
Im so sorry that happened to you! You are a beautiful girl and don't let anyone tell you any different! You will always be accepted by your fellow trans women (like me) and other lgbt peeps.
Aww sorry that happened to you
Hang in there
I’m sorry for your situation dear. Your a strong woman and have full control of your happiness. I’m thinking you’ll be just fine. Peace to you.
sorry for you experience with your dad

i have 9 children and i'd never stop loving any of them for any reason... i'm so sorry...

i hope that you find nice new ""found family"" :)
Whether he realizes what he’s lost or not, you deserve love even if he won’t give it to you. I’m so sorry ❤️
I am so sorry to hear this.  My heart aches.  It’s his loss.  He had himself a beautiful daughter any one of use would love to call our own daughter.  Take pride in your strength and know there are a lot of us women out there (including myself) who would be proud to call you our beautiful daughter.  If ever you need encouragement, I will be here for you.

☺️🥰☺️
Like others said this could be temporary, a shock to his system and something to get his head around. Not making excuses, he’s wrong for disowning you. But just make the decision if you’re gonna leave the door open for him to redeem himself (you don’t have to of course). For some it’s so overwhelming and I personally don’t get it but that’s how it is. It’s a big big change and scary to think about all at once for them. Once they see you’re doing well they might come around.
Keep going you can’t please everyone your happiness is to important
Me too, but I've done alright without him for over 9 years. Hope you're doing alright
I feel you. As an older parent, I’ve never, ever understood abandoning your own kids. Hope for the best for you.
Obviously, HIS loss.  Sorry you had to face that, but you **do** know you're not the only one among us whose parents' / siblings' ""love"" for us... was conditional on our conforming to their small-mindedness and bigotry.  We're bigger than that!

Not to worry; you're *beautiful!*  You'll be ok; I promise!
Your father has clearly chosen to miss out on a wonderful daughter. You're a part of our community, you will always be loved and welcome here.
Sorry to hear that :( hopefully one day he will come around, until then he has a lot to thinking to do clearly…
I’m sorry that happened to you. A real man would accept you for whomever you choose to be.
He didn’t lose you sweetheart…he just have to deal with his own “baggage”. 
Don’t judge him harshly. As fathers, we have expectations when you are born. We “expect” certain things to turn out the way we expect it to. If you’re born a male, as fathers, we have all these dreams for our son.
I know that my own father had expected me to follow in his own footsteps as a professional baseball player. It didn’t happen because I was very sick as a young boy. My mother didn’t want me to be running around in the cold outside because of this condition. I was very, very good at baseball, but my mother won out. I couldn’t play.
Honey, our parents are humans also. This is probably a shock to your father, but give it time. Believe me as a father, I LOVE my children no matter what !!!
You seem like a beautiful person. You’re father will hopefully recognize that eventually…
Love and best wishes….Paul 
You can talk to me anytime……
His loss. Plenty of parents would love to have a daughter like you.
You deserve better! You deserve a family that won’t betray you.

I’m a parent, I couldn’t imagine treating either of my kids like that - their happiness is *everything* I want for them.
You are so beautiful. I am glad you say you are thriving you deserve to be happy!
Not to mention losing someone to change his diapers when he's too old to manage the bathroom anymore.

Like, do these parents not think about the long-term consequences of their actions?

Regardless, I'm glad you're happy and thriving!
Wow so beautiful :)
“Todo el mundo esta loco” in da getto
Love this mindset. Much love to you, gorgeous! 💞
But you look beautiful
❤️
He doesn't deserve to call himself your father. You're beautiful and going to have a wonderful life with or without him!
He lost a pretty awesome person
I’m so sorry to hear that
So pretty 🤩
You're beautiful. We all accept you here love
We love to see it :)))
Feel for you, sweetheart,  way to stand up for yourself!
You are beautiful. No parent should ever do such a thing for such a reason. May love surround you always.
I hope you're ok 🥺
Are you in LA
He’s a fucking weakling
your father doesn't love u he loves himself.  there are no conditions in love.  none
You are absolutely beautiful and I'm so sorry that you have to deal with that
I think you’re gorgeous
I’m so sorry people are like this
I’m so very sorry for that… but You Are Beautiful and one should be proud of you no matter you choices
Well that's his loss, really he's just jealous his wife doesn't look half as good as you
You are better off without him emotionally
I'm sorry that you don't have your dad but honestly happiness is better and also you being yourself is better than conditional love from others. Self love is way better trust me
He done fucked up
That's his own fault. I no longer identify as trans, but I accept you for who you are. I see you as a very strong and beautiful woman
You look cute
You're right it's 100% percent his loss girl you deserve to be happy ❤️
His loss Hun, sending hugs 💓💓
His loss.
Sometimes parents can't face change like kids can. Sometimes someone's political and/or religious beliefs prevent them from being understanding of others situations. 

And sometimes we have to say F them and just be who we are and are meant to be. You are loved. You are valid and, at least to the Goddess, a very, very special person. 

Be you, the you that makes you happy. Find your family cause we aren't always born into the family that will love us. Sometimes we have to build that family from understanding and supportive friends. Find yours and find ur happiness. 

It's his loss, not urs.
He lost who is pretty much the most beautiful girl alive. There is a great community here. You aren't alone. Feel comfortable to reach out to anyone 🙏❤️
I feel for you and I'm glad it seems you're doing better now. And I mean, it is your dad's loss, but it legitimately makes me sick when LGBTQ kids are kicked out/disowned just for being LGBTQ.
you're cute 💕
I have a trans son and I love him with all my heart. I can't imagine not loving him. Your dad's lose to and if you ever find yourself alone and need to talk to a dad you can get ahold  of me . Be safe.
Yes he did so sorry Beautiful
Sorry about your dad disowning you, i know it hurts, but at least you have us and we love you for you ☺️❤️! The beautiful girl that you are, who's gorgeous and stunning and strong! You got this queen 👸👑! Keep on slaying 😘!
I was no contact with my parents for 5 years. He may come around but it's his issue to work through. As a father to three wonderful daughters I couldn't imagine ever disowning them for any reason ever. You have a whole community here and we love and support you. If you need a terrible dad joke then dm me!!
Your fathers reaction is normal and fairly common as a parent to trans kids. Right now he’s feeling the loss of his son, and it will take time for him to accept you as you feel inside. Sometimes parents may take years to rebuild or if the relationship between the two of you is toxic enough, it could take so long that he dies before accepting you as you are now. It just depends on the communication moving forward and perspectives changing over time, both yours and his.
You are way too amazing to be disowned...he is a fool
What happened with your girlfriend?
his loss, the world gained another gorgeous woman!
His loss. You’re OUR sister ♥️
Anyone who can disown a child because of gender is an absolute monster IMO.  here you are clearly radiant and thriving.  You deserve better!  I hope you make a wonderful life for yourself, and I have no doubt you will!  HUGGLES 💗
Do what makes you happy !
This parent loves you pretty girl! We aren't the same as ones own but there are quite a few of us that live to see you thrive in your skin and we really do love you
So glad you're not too hurt over it, you definitely seem very happy, very great to hear!
He can pound sand.  Good for you!
Your gorgeous! Don't stop being you girl!!! Freaking amazing
Wow, imagine hating yourself so much that you disown your own thriving and happy daughter. What a miserable man he must be. Sorry that happened nonetheless, wishing you the best🥰
I’m so sorry. Maybe someday he’ll understand. 💜💜💜
My ""father"" told me how lucky I was because a lot of other dads would just disown me.

Guess what I did.
OMG YOUR SO BEAUTIFULLLL
I feel your pain. My mother is currently not speaking to me since I've worn makeup.
Would someone PLEASE tell me why virtual hugs are not a thing already???
Do NOT try to reach out to him. He has to come to you and ask forgiveness for abandoning his child in a time of need. He is a poor ass excuse for a man and a father.
Don’t forget, you still have all of us on your side. Your definitely not alone.
You’re adorable 😭😭 you look like a fairy 😍😍😍😍
He definitely lost a beautiful and strong daughter. I have a nagging feeling this is going to happen with my mother when I start transitioning. You know what though, this life is about my needs and happiness. If my choices aren't something that's going to hurt somebody, then I'm gonna go for it. You only get one chance at this life, I'm going to be who I'm meant to be. Stay strong sister!
W Quacks L Dad 🙌
Listen maybe it’s because ur ug.ly
Listen maybe it’s because ur ug.ly
That sounds like an awesome cult chant. Are we starting a cult?! Can I join?!
This! He also lost a very gorgeous daughter too. Welcome to your new family sister
It's a lot better already! My mental health is the best it's ever been. Thank you!

I hope things continue to be good for you as well! 😊
Nah. There's a fine line between ""I disagree with your transness but I still love you"" and ""We will not be having a parent-child relationship on account of my bigotry"". Fuck her dad. Fuck my dad. Fuck any parent who pulls this shit. Don't give them a second chance, for the sake of your health and happiness.
It's probably for the best and I'm glad your able to cut ties if it doesn't work out. I hope you can thrive and show them it's their loss.
It’s from the movie Freaks!
Get in loser, we're starting a cult
Ohhh are you in yet??? Can you get me in too??????
It’s been a journey for sure but better each day!
That can be a gulf, but you never - although maybe you do, you know him better than I. Sorry it came to that though.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELLIOT PAGE!!		"me and him have the same birthday what
he looks so unhappy in this photo
I didn't know he put out an emo punk album, lol jk
I love him so much, happy birthday to my mans!
Hes got the straigh white guy outfit of a white t-shirt, and jeans on lol. Happy birthday to them.
Equal parts Icon, Legend, and Pioneer 🌟
To our favourite famous transmasc enby! 🎉
Honestly he looks like he was just walking and someone lept out at him with a camera.
I chose the name Elliot and my birthday was a few days ago so when I read the first part I was really confused lol. Anyway yeah happy birthday to Elliot Page :)
Question. Do y’all think that Vanya from the Umbrella Academy is going to be transmasc as well in season 3? Or is Elliot going to keep playing Vanya as a female character?
happy birthday Elliot ""transition goals"" Page 🎉🎉🎉
Damn he's looking mighty snazzy these days.
Everything anyone says about Timothy chamalam looking like a sickly Victorian applies to Elliot. Except with greasy hair. I love him in everything tho.
idk who this is. you mind telling me who they are?
It's his birthday? I had no idea. Happy Birthday you handsome devil!
He’s so good as Ariadne in Inception!
Happy birthday
He was great in Hard Candy. I can't believe how well he played a little girl in that movie even though he always felt he was a man. So glad he's his true self now.

Same! Happy late birthday!
Happy birthday!!
he recently spoke about how he was constantly being attacked in the streets, there were people throwing stuff at him or yelling at him
Can you blame him? We all already get enough induvial backlash from our own parents, and community. I can't imagine the stress he feels from Hollywood, and social media, with every single conservative weighing in on his transition.
I agree. Terrible how he's been treated, from what I understand.
To be fair, all of his characters are majorly depressed, so I think people are reading into what could very well  just be his brand.
[removed]
i didn’t know Elliot was non-binary
my birthday was a few days ago too! on the 11th
i dont think vanya should transition, vanya isn't elliot and she doesn't have to change just because the actor who plays her has come out as trans
It's been previously reported that Vanya will stay as a woman, as is canon (though they already had a fairly androgynous wardrobe).
elliot is an actor and activist! he is known for his roles in umbrella academy, Juno, X-Men, inception and a bunch of other stuff ❤️ he's also directed documentaries (gaycation, there's something in the water)
It’s not cool to police people’s emotional expression!
the fuck, dude?
thank u!!
😳
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 💕💕
Mine too!
This sounds awesome having a mom that can understand you like this!

He uses he/they pronouns
Not with that voice now.
Woah that's so cool
Did Elliot post it as a birthday pic? If so, I apologize. 

If not, I'm doing nothing of the sort. I think this is actually a pretty great picture. I'm policing OP's choice in how they picked a birthday picture for another person. It's just not a good birthday picture
Aw, thanks
Nice, Happy (late by now) Birthday!
The wonders of being publically identifiable and trans :/ it's fucked up but I'm not even slightly surprised
Thats so insanely stupid I'm almost not offended by it. Like, these people truly are beyond parody.
I understand the frustration but please keep that kind of talk out of here

that doesn't necessarily mean he's nonbinary
I take that back. It's not a good birthday picture if you don't know anything about the birthday haver's preferences.
I know! Expressing myself on my commute scares me more than expressing myself in class
Sorry. I'm not in a great place ATM. I don't wish violence on anyone, even if they're bigots. I just believe in deterrence. 

And I'm just venting after an awful conversation involving coming out to my transphobic mother...Military tech always provided me a great distraction from dealing with the fact that I'm woman trapped in a man's body...again I'm sorry.
I'm not going to give like, an actual thought out argument to a blatant transphobe
If that's what you have to tell yourself 😌
Went from transphobe to complete looney pretty quickly.

Have you considered the fact that not everyone believes in them and some believe in entirely different ones?

Also “ I such thing as athiesm”

That’s funny don’t make me laugh, as an atheist I can confirm it is a real belief (or lack there of).

Let people be themselves if it makes them happy and I can confirm it does.
When he first came out , he came out as non-binary.  Not sure if that has changed since however.
Yeah, it's not worth it. Never play defense. 

I just thought it was funny word choice, and it reminded me of that clip
It hasn't, publicly at least. People just call them a man because enbyphobia.

Hey sis, I hope you don't mind me asking, but out of curiosity, have you had any ffs or breast augmentation? Please don't take offense to this, I am also transfem, you look REALLY beautiful, and I wanted to know if I can also expect that from hrt alone, as surgery is pretty out of reach for now... Thanks if you answer this! :)
You look stunningly gorgeous.💕 Work on the wink:)
Wowza! If I saw you ANYPLACE I'd wink back at you.

Okay sorry 😂
It’s tricky for me to answer. I’ve only been on a low dose for 14 months. 12.5mg of cypro and 2mg E. my face feminising has been more than I could ask for and same for boob growth. However when I started hormones I was a bit over weight, I’ve lost nearly 11kg since then and I’m only just now starting to get a figure so it’s been difficult to track my fat redistribution because of all the old fat that was still on me. I’m hoping when I reach my goal weight after losing another 3-6kg, fat redistribution will become more visible. Sorry for the bad answer 😞

Happy trans mom here :) ask me how many times I've seen Cars 3		"How many times have you seen cars 3 mom?
I hope I'll be as beautiful as you are when I'm a mom
Cars is so cute. Kinda like this picture.
When do you think you'll traumatise your kid with The Dark Crystal?
But can you quote lines from Bluey?
What about Shrek the Third ?
A couple of cuties. I've watched A lot of those kids movies too. It's amazing how many times they can watch it over and over.
But not Encanto?
This is amazing. We always need more accepting parents.
Thats the cutest pic everrrrr
I can’t believe nobody has asked you how many times you’ve seen Cars 3! So, how many?
also trans mom here
all the love 💜💜💜
Your so beautiful
Wish my daughter would see me 😭
you’re so pretty 🫶🏾
How many times did you see cars 3? I saw it twice... My niece and nephew liked it.
I can’t see you? Are you trans-parent
Trans mom represent! Currently watching Mickey Mouse Mix Up or something. We needed a break from Bluey. 🤣
Congrats darling. Was it an adoption or surrogate? I am a Trans Girl engaged to be married. Im sure having children will crop up.
Any advice pls? I am prepared to under go surgery to allow a trans girl can bear children.
I’m still yet to see cars 3
*Kachows proudly*
Oh my god you're gorgeous! If I'm half as beautiful as you by the time I'm on HRT I'll be happy forever <3
Hopefully not as many times as I've seen zootropolis (Zootopia in some jurisdictions)
Hey, another Trans mom! It feels like there are so few of us...
aah! you’re beautiful and you’re living a dream… being a mom :)

this is really inspiring to me as a 20 year old who started three months ago 🥰
I envy you, firstly because you look fantastic, but also because Cars 3 is a cinematic masterpiece.
God damn I’m tearing up looking at this, being a mom is something I want so much and looking at you being so happy it’s just something else
opinion on the movie soul?
You are so gorgeous!!!
You look beautiful 🫶🏻🙂
Aww this is so nice, thanks for sharing ☺️
My guess is, as many as it takes?
Probably about the same amount of times I was made to sit though Mary Poppins!
hey mom, how many times have you seen Cars 3??
Frozen 2 is the soundtrack of my life.
❤️
Haha! I, too, have felt the power of a Cars 3 obsession!

I’m so happy for you and your family that you are free to be you! ❤️
How does it feel to be a mom?
You two are so adorable together!
AWWWWWW
You are awesome!!!
Keep being awsome and sharing these experiences with your kid.  Even if it seems like they are more interested in the movie, they know you're there with them.  There are alot of great suggestions in the comments, and I'll toss my hat in the Studio Ghibli catalog.  Every one is gorgeous, and the stories are fantastic.
How meny times u seen monsters inc
Cruise Ramirez is a big hit in our house too hahaha. You are certainly goals. I’m 8 months along. Still guy moding at work. But I’m just about mom at home.
You are going to make me cry 🥺
I do not like cars 3

However you seem like a very nice person, and i wish I could look as good as you /nsx
Omb, when I was little I’d watch it like 1.12 times a day. Also you look great I’m kinda jelly ngl
Can I guess how many times you’ve seen it?
Same here!

And turning red, and Moana, and cars 1, 2, and 3 and all the shorts…
We personally preferred Cars 2….. my two boys watched it with me over and over when they were little.  A few months ago, we pulled it out for movie night and we enjoyed it again.  They are 11&12 now and it was funny to hear them talking about their memories “when they were little” watching that movie.
Let it go...
Your kid has good taste. Very respectable taste
How many times have you seen Cars 3?
OMG at least 30-50
how many lol
Beautiful and amazing 💖
Cars 3 is really good tho
Very cute
Definitely goals <3
Once for every like
Ohmigosh gorgeous!! 😍😍😍 Happy pride month!
You're gorgeous! I'm a Trans Mom too.. hoping to look half a good as you. 💗💗
Happy trans mother gorgeous queen boss angel
I hope you I have a wonderful trans mother’s gorgeous angel queen
car go weewoo ?
Yeah ""Cars 3"" sounds different after having watched One Day At A Time...😶
7453 times and you know all the songs?
I mean Cars 3 goes hard tho!
How many times have you seen Cars 3?
I would estimate 150+
Hope you are doing well
There is so much happiness in your eyes!
Aaaawwww, so cute
Cars 3 is a masterpiece. Cars 2… we don’t talk about 🤣
Cars three is a banger, met my best friend by singing the cars 2 theme when I was younger
💕
Cars 3 is the best one!

And you're so pretty 🌸
Awww what a cute photo
Hey!  I'm a trans mom too!  Honestly, I never thought it would happen and I'd be here, but I'm happier in life than I've ever thought imaginable!  I bet you're a great mommy 💕!
Lol got grandkids I feel your pain
How many times have you seen *Cars 3*?
Wow talk about transition goals!
This picture unexpectedly brings joy to my heart, I wish you the best, trans moms are the best! ♥️
Adorable!
You’re so pretty🥰 sending lots of love
Ask me if I dreamed of watching Cars 3 over and over again Mr. McQueen! Go Ahead!
You're absolutely beautiful
how many exact times have you seen Cars 3
I wish i can look like you one day, you look amazing
The first shot or what as mum..?
My goodness you're the same age as my fiancée and look so similar to her I had to panic double take. And according to your flaire you even started HRT around the same time. Spooky! You are lovely 💙 that's a mom glow if I've ever seen one.
Too much time
Our toddler LOVES Moana, Cars and Luca. He also bellows ""My Shot"" at the top of his lungs and dances for ""Newsies"" . I think we've got a future theater kid 😉

You look SO happy and proud to be a mom, same as me. 🥰
You are one of the most beautiful women I ever seen, seriously!
How often? 😁 Have a nice evening, both of you.
It just dawned on me that it isn't your child who's trans haha, you pass incredibly well! Very sweet face too x

Cars 3 is so good! I loved it!!
What is an AFAB
Vous êtes une superbe femme ❤️
Probably not as many times as I've seen Madagascar 😅
More times than Luca but fewer times than Moana

Yeah, The Dark Crystal is a weird one. It felt really cringy and very obviously aimed at children, but there were also a lot of very not kid-friendly elements too. I didn't really enjoy it purely because of how very in between worlds it was, I couldn't decide whether to go into Child Mode or Adult Mode while watching it.
why is bluey genuinely good though
For real life?
Omg bluey is my life
We love all the Shreks equally in this household.
[removed]
My daughter will walk around the house singing ""LET IT GOOOO, LET IT GOOOO"", and no other words from that song, on repeat, until you tell her to stop. Like 20 straight minutes of that. She's at least getting old enough that she tries to match pitch lol.
Oh hell yes Encanto
Lol my 3 y/o isn't trans, I am.
At least a few times a week for the last month or two!
A lot of times. I liked it too :) it's got a good ending imo.
This is my favorite trans joke.
Bluey is one of my favs… it’s great for the kids and an excellent example of good parenting
My daughter is three. My wife and I had her before I started transitioning. I've only started firing blanks in the last few months haha.

Edit: I don't know if you're engaged to an AFAB or not, but if you're willing (and still have your OEM AMAB equipment lol) you can consider pausing HRT for a few months to see if your fertility will return strong enough to put one in the oven. Really, good luck! Getting pregnant is hard enough without all the complications being trans brings.
What is an OEM AMAB? Im not familiar with these terms
First one was good, second one was okay, third one was good. Imo. Also a big fan of Planes.
*SPEED. I. AM. SPEEEEED.*
I'm about 5 months into HRT right now, and this is admittedly a good picture. They don't all look quite that feminine. It's a process! But I can say for sure that after 5mo HRT and 8 months of laser, I look at old pics of myself and don't recognize who I see.
Trans moommmmmms! <3
I hope you find a way to make that happen someday <3 I got lucky. My wife and I had our daughter before I realized I was trans. But yeah I'm pretty sure my fertility is toast by now lol.
Gah! I've only seen like half of it. Looked cute. Need to finish it sometime.
Think of your age. Divide it by two. Now multiply it by two. This number is less than the amount of times I've seen Cars 3.
Anna's song when she's in the cave after Olaf blows away gives me goosebumps EVERY time.

🎵 *when its cleeeaar, that EVERYTHING will NEVER be the saaaame aaaaah-gain* 🎵

Ugh. Love that movie. I may have cried.
My little girl started using she/her pronouns for me without us even asking her to. She just kinda got it. I could cry. (and I frequently do)
Absolutely wonderful. I am so excited to be a mom to a daughter, and the wife of a wife. Could not be luckier.
My daughter weirdly was never into those, so only a couple of times (aside from all the times I watched them when I was younger).
Honestly, same. I started transition last October and I'm not out at work either. 

EDIT: and yeah Cruise is a wonderful character. I loved how it ended!
Probably, yeah. But what makes it more complicated is I don't know how many times I've seen it.
I bet that's just wild. I can't imagine my daughter being 12 lol
More times than I've seen the newest Matrix movie, thank god.
Honestly, probably lol
Yo there's a lot more there than there used to be! It's a wonderful feeling to know yourself. If you're here I'm sure you can relate.
Hey don't be talking shit on my boy Mater lol
Ugh, huge same. I never though *i* would be trans lol. I spent the first 27 years of my life thinking I was cis. Then all the suppressed memories from my childhood decided to show up one day and my world was kinda shattered. Did some exploration, felt unimaginably happy. Several therapy sessions later and boom, turns out I'm trans lol.
That's awfully kachow of you
Couldn't answer that if my life depended on it lol
That's really really nice of you to say :) you made my night! Thank you 💜
Thank ya :) and yeah my 3 year old is definitely a little young for gender identity stuff lol
And you’re transphobic
I was born male, yes. I've got male anatomy, yes. But to tell you the truth, I've known something was wrong since I was about 10 years old. If you're ever curious to chat about it, please do DM me! I'll answer any questions you've got. Anything. Try me.

You're free to hate me for what I am. I can't stop you from doing that. But if any part of you is even the slightest bit curious about how a person ends up like me - ask. I'm not going be angry, or judgmental, or defensive. Let's talk.
Well actually that's the beautiful part! You see, we don't have to teach her anything. Kids don't grow up hating others unless you teach them to. Your parents evidently made some mistakes in the process of raising you, but I'm sure they were fine people otherwise. Lastly, please don't feel bad. It's not like you could've just outgrown their shortcomings and formed your own opinions about the world.
Assigned female at birth
When you go past using numbers and just have to reference other movies to say how many times 😅 honestly love this, hope I can be this great of a mom
Moana is so good. It feels like there are a lot of parallels between that story and the journey most of us go on at some point; to find ourselves, our chosen families, and our place in the world.
My top level is Coco. My kid watched that movie nonstop for three months and then never again.
Your eyes in this photo scream ""Too many times!!"" Lol

You're seriously gorgeous though momma, you're goals for sure 😍
Oh I love Luca that one is my favorite in terms of Pixar movies plus I bought the art book of it recently
My little siblings have those movies in the exact same order. Love seeing how universal kids’ enjoyment of those movies are and just how tortured the adults around them all are
Moana is my absolute favorite Disney movie
+1
Just go neither and enjoy Jim Henson's masterpiece
I wasn’t making a good or bad judgement about Bluey, just that we have watched it *multiple* times here with my daughter.
Muffin is the best
Even the musical?
Well, it's the third Shrek.
Kids...
Oh, sorry. I was tired when I wrote that and was trying to refer to you but I didn't think about how weird it was phrased until now.
Well I mean they could be, you never know lmao
What complications were those if you dont mind me asking. Im Samantha by the way im a Preop girl been transitioning since I was 10 love my female body. I haven't had surgery I grew my own breasts and very happy being Trans female. From one Trans  girl to another you are beautiful and feminine.
OEM AMAB? I dont quite understand.
I hope I can start before the end of this year.... it's a loooooong process.
My wife is a beautiful Trans mom, and our middle child is a very handsome Trans boy who's been verbal since 2½, and finally came out with our help at 6. He's so much happier. His smiles look so different...
its a really good movie pal i would love to hear your thoughts after you finished
oh crap i'm bad at math but i guess it makes sense
I feel that girl, even though it's been played by request like a billion times I still get sucked into it regularly hehe.
Do you go by mom, mother, mama, or mommy?
Yeah, one day I realized I couldn’t pick up my kids…. It made me sad!
I'm not there yet, but I will one day. Posts like these give me hope and strength!
I love Mater! Just didn’t like the plot. I would never talk shit on the homie!!
Just saying the facts
My apologies! Have a lovely day <3
[removed]
God damn, power to you for throwing love back to a transphobic person and daring them to actually try and connect and reconsider.
Okay for real, and Moana has got one of my favorite kids movie soundtracks ever. Just love that movie.
Yes! This and frozen hit so hard in that sense
Coco is so sad tho, but it's really good movie. The way that it handles the abstract concept of death is so scary though, I couldn't see myself as a kid watching it that much 😅
tyvm :)
Luca is beautiful and as a queer person, it's even more special.
+1
There a musical?!? Iv never watched any of the movies
I saw a local production of the musical and it was.... not good. It's a small town and the talent pool is shallower than my daughter's favorite splash park.
So there was another two?
No sweat haha. I do some goofy stuff when I get tired. Ever put the box of cereal into the fridge with the milk? I have.
Sorry I was being a little tongue-in-cheek. OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. It's an automotive term used to describe ""original parts"". So OEM AMAB equipment would be, ya know, a pre-bottom surgery transfem. Was saying if you've still got that you can attempt to have a biological child.
I still have the OEM parts lost one testicle to cancer but still firing on all cylinders. HRT has made me the girl I am today. Surgery is what I am going to do so I can have a bear children and give  birth naturally I want my Husband to be happy. Id do anything  for him hes a real Gentleman from Mississippi. I have made initial enquiries about the surgery, what to expect loss of my penis and have a fully working vagina,and also have the internal engineering to have a child and carry to term and give birth. Its going to be painful and quite a long recovery but its all worth it for he is my Husband and want to make him happy. What better way to be a full woman not just the outside.
Good luck to you! I think it was about 4 months between when I first called my endocrinologist and when I had my first appointment / got a prescription. I'm in the US.

Also, be prepared for the first 2 months of HRT to be a big nothingburger. It starts slow. But girl does it pick up!
Oh wow, that's so young! As a girl that didn't figure it out until 27 years old, myself, I love that your son was clearly raised in an environment where he was able to work that out so early. That speaks volumes about the kind of love and acceptance you promote in your household.

Good for y'all :) I wish you and your son all the luck in the world 💜

My daughter is 3 and so far seems to be a pretty girly girl. She's got two moms and she just loves doing her hair, dresses, pretending to do makeup, etc. We're really careful not to push her either way though.
I will push my daughter to try Soul again instead of Cars. She's gonna yell at me though.
For real my daughter is getting SO big lol. I go to pick her up and in my mind I'm like ""k girl lift with your legs"".
Oh shush you have nothing to apologize for lol. You're fine :) and you too!
I think you should honestly, you’re a disappointment.
Frozen 2 is mine for that, bonus points as she sings ""show yourself"" and paints the bi flag, I know they're just good colors but I saw what I saw
This so much. Both of those movies are really good at making my eyes leak.
My kid was obsessed with skeletons.
Same here but I also fell in love with everything about the film not just the themes but also the characters personalities, setting of Italy, and the character design

It drops a t slur in the first song
I thought there were four…
I put my wallet in the fridge and was searching for hours the next day
I came out to my doc last November, since then I've had about 5 appointments with a Belgian psychologist, I got diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria today so now we can actually start a process. 

I'm in The Netherlands... My doctor has a trans son (ftm, what are the odds?) so she knew all the ""backdoors."" Theres a waitlist of AT LEAST 3 years in The Netherlands before you get an intake, that's not even a proper session.... I've luckily managed to dodge that list by going abroad. These are the downsides of public healthcare..! 

I cannot. Fucking. Wait.... I'm happy for you <3

EDIT: I dunno if anyone else sees it, but your face kinda reminds me of Judy Alvarez from CP2077 in this pic, lol. It's the cheekbone I think, so cute :3
good luck with that lmao
Ha!
[removed]
Same! Giulia is my favorite!
+1
Oh. Witch one?? F slur? t slur?
There are indeed four, and I know I said we love all Shreks equally but lets be real the 3rd and 4th movies aren't as good as the first two.
Lmao. Sometimes I put my car keys in the fridge on purpose so I remember to get my lunch before I leave for work lol.
Oh wow, she's cute! Thank ya :) and my god, 3 years to get in with an endo. I would die. That sounds awful!
+1
T
True.
Wait tahts smart
You absolute genius!
It's 3 years to get an intake with a psychologist. At the very least it's another 1,5 year to get to an endo after that. 

Our government decides how a person has to transition, you have to follow their process or you're shown the door.

For example, you have to live as a female for a year. That means dressing like a women, no hormones, no voice training, no laser therapy etc. etc. Its fucking stupid... I know I wouldn't be able to do that, my dysphoria and anxiety would shoot through the roof.

My Belgian psychologist is part of a group of psychologists specialised in gender dysphoria and part of the Benelux Gender team. She has certificates and diploma's coming out her arse so many. She's highly critical of our systems. In her opinion, the Dutch system doesn't actually help anyone with gender dysphoria, which is evidenced by the huge amount of Dutch people avoiding the Dutch system by going abroad or DIY'ing their transition without an endo.

She says it's utterly insane that a highly personal procedure such as transitioning is mandated by the state. It's something a person should be able to do their way and I can't say I disagree with that.

My Dad Nods Everytime He Says My Name	"I (20m) recently came out as transgender to my dad. We're German and my name (it's Nick) translates to the German word for ""nod"". So now my dad nods everytime he says my name. It's a stupid little joke between us but it makes me so incredibly happy and I just wanted to share it with someone."	"Your dad is adorable
Awww
Thats so cute stop 😭
Supportive dad jokes are the best kind of dad jokes. Hope you have a good time Nick because you are a very good boy.
That's adorable oh my god
So that's your Nickname?
I only read the first part and I thought it was going to be sad but this is so cute! Good for you!
Das hat mich total glücklich gemacht voll süß von ihm!! Dad jokes sind so eine besondere Art von Unterstützung.. hätte ich auch gern.

Translation (sorry i don't see german people here a lot so i wanted to answer in german haha): that made me so happy that's so sweet of him!! Dad jokes are such a special kind of support.. i'd love to have that as well.
That's so cute!! Im so happy for you!
Congrats btw :3
That's sweet! 💗
Abgenickt von Tech-Nick :-P
I’m not crying it’s just allergies… to cuteness.
Dad moment.
Aww that’s so sweet. I was named after my dad so when I chose my new name I made sure to pick one that was directly linked to him and my old self
can I borrow your dad?
Dad of the year, right here
hi nod
Dad of the year right there bro. Wish my dad would accept that I'm a woman
that's so cute, he sounds nice c:
Omg he is so fucking cute. He's awesome 😎
Progressive dad jokes

Love it!
Hat er es abgenickt?
Based dad
*karen voice*

STOP I'M ALLERGIC TO WHOLESOME YOU'RE KILLING ME TAKE THIS DOWN RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!
Nick passt bestimmt zu dir (*nicke dabei bedächtlich mit dem Kopf*). Freut mich, dass das ein schöner Insider zwischen euch beiden geworden ist.

Nick fits you well! (*nodding my head in agreement*). I'm glad you have this inside joke with your dad.
Man you really set up that dad joke for him
Can he be my dad too? My name is Nicco
That's a level 2 dad joke.
I’m glad he’s open to it
wtf that’s adorable 😭
[nods head]
I am also German and named Nick!

I should tell my dad!

<333 c :
That is simply brilliant. You've got a good dad!
That is simply brilliant. You've got a good dad!
good papa, 5 stars ⭐️
Congratulations
Your dad responded with a sad joke. That’s a huge win.
Aww that is soo amazing and sweet, you have a wonderful father.
Nods
May I borrow him? Just for a bit?
This is the best dad joke, he's ascended this plane of existence with your help 😂
Das ist so süß, dein Vater ist bezaubernd
😍 so sweet!!

I just arrived to Germany for the second time. I’m trying to learn to speak German! My partner is German. I love to hear happy lgbtq stories!
Wholesome,  100%
He is the sweetest person over 50 anyone can find
Dad's are ether lovely people or spawns of some hot guy down south
Aw man, you're too kind. Crying at the club right now.
Badumm tss
AYYYYYYYY!
Freut mich :^)
Ich wünsche dir ganz viel Glück für die Zukunft!
Es ist cool etwas in deutch zu sehn! Dad jokes sind wirklich die besten!
Wait wait wait.

There's no German word for ""Dad jokes""?
Thank you so much!!
HAHAHAHAHAHA
That's so sweet!! How did he react?
He's basically adopting all of my friends with daddy issues. So yes, join the family.
Pffft
I'm so sorry about that. I hope he'll come around. Best of luck!
Wortwörtlich
Als ich mir die Haare kurz geschnitten und schwarz gefärbt hatte, meinte meine Partnerin, ich sähe aus wie der kleine Nick. Daher kommt mein Name.
Join the family
He's trying to get to level 99
Omg! Twins!!
*nods*
Most importantly, it's the *nod pf parental approval*™
Technically there is the literal translation ""Papa Witze"" but that sounds horrible and to my knowledge nobody uses it but i could be wrong
There is a concept of Ü40-Humor (humour for people above 40), but nothing quite like dad joke

However, the magic of the German is that you can always make up a compound for it. I propose *Vaterwitze*
Ofcourse!!
Schön dass ich dich amüsieren kann \^\^
Actually I haven’t told him yet. He’s the only person I haven’t come out to. I don’t think he would be mean or anythin but we’ve *always* had a rocky relationship and we’re just now fixin it and I don’t want to jeopardize that. Plus he has Alzheimer’s among other things so I don’t to put a lot of stress on him or cause anythin
Ahaha, can I pls join.
Thank you
Ich kann mir kaum einen schöneren Weg vorstellen, als so seinen Namen zu finden.
I will
He's on his way. He's just got to make the ""hi trans I'm dad"" meme and the mandatory ""trans parent"" joke and he's in.
Yes!
Oh man... I'm so sorry. I hope you figure it out and that everything ends up being okay. Best of luck, ma'am!
Thanks but don’t be sorry. We’ve all come to terms with his disease a long time ago. Besides he’s still mostly “there” rn anyway. He can still do most things. Hell he builds and refurbishes vintage electric guitars and writes rock songs in his free time (so most of the time lol). He’s got a whole room dedicated to just his music. He’s got over 30 vintage and collectible guitars on his walls (some of which are quite literally priceless and will be sent to museums after he passes and one already has been). But he also plays piano, sax, and drums and built a custom racing simulator with real NASCAR approved equipment and decked out his house in smart stuff and put in a crazy surround sound stereo system just to listen to vinyl. 

I only tell you all this because Ik most people see Alzheimer’s and immediately feel sorry for him/us and think he’s not capable of doin much but I don’t want anyone to feel that way. He’s lived a full life. He got to do what he loved everyday for over 22 years (master mechanic, US Army) and now he will get to spend the rest of his life doin almost whatever he wants and he’s happy about it. He knows what’s comin and he’s prepared for it and has decided to make the most of his life rather than living in fear of the inevitable. Please go have a good day
He sounds like a really great person. I'm glad he's doing so good."	w1v0f6	trans	3285	0.98	2022-07-18 09:27:48

🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 my heart hurts tysm !!
I had estrogen problems when I was younger and my boobs grew a lot
I think the notion of you describing that situation as a ""problem"" is a pattern you may wish to reexamine.

You are a total fox btw.
Sweet tattoos as well
Nah ,this is what i see
Thank you so much! I’m really happy for you too! 🥰❤️🏳️‍⚧️💙💖🤍💖💙
Aww well you look fabulous! :)

Huh. Interesting
You are so very welcome and so very pretty. I hope and wish you all the best in life. Wish I could’ve met someone like you in person. Keep on being you no matter what!!!!
oh okay, I'm on hormones for 9 months... and got smol pancakes
Well at that time I spent most of my puberty with lil tits before going out with my gender and was not easy, people suck
The problem was t
Did them 2 days ago hahaha
It's normal if your hrt consists of non progesterone, I can tell when I had progesterone my tits grew like crazy
Damnnn well they’re fire for sure
ah I don't want huge ones, I just want B-cups, but sexuologists here don't give receipt for progesterone, they say that it's bad for boobs uhm... how.to.say in english.. developement.. that it makes them grow faster but that's all"	pmqini	trans	3263	0.97	2021-09-12 10:46:39
Wholesome supportive friend		"They never believe in the beginning🥺😰
That guy's face makes him look transphobic. I must be reading that wrong.
I prefer this version (and I don't think I even need to read the original to know I prefer this version).

Edit: I've been told the original isn't bad like I feared. :)
This is more funnier than it intended to be 😂 cute ending tho
Im not in school anymore, but it would be interesting to ask a friend to purposely bully you with ""affirming"" gender comments, when you're not passing yet. So all the other kids will finally call you those names too. But little do they know, its your identity. We are outsmarting the real bullies here.
I do love support through teasing.
The good ending
Having support from another would be awesome.
The good ending
It's not a ""girl bike"" the center bar is straight across. On girl bikes it dips down.

The only thing ""girl"" about it is that it's pink.
This reminds me of a regular at work, he's always coming in and saying I look cute with my long silky hair, but little does he know.. 😂

I like to joke with him and be like ""Why thank you! Sometimes I like to feel pretty too you know"" and he always gets a chuckle out of it!
Lucky bastard, she gets to take hormones while I can’t even get blockers
Is this legal to starting HRT before 18?
Fun fact: she had him moaning like a good boy later that night 🤣 we love a supportive king.
Repost
A based friend.
lmao
This my goals of life
I must be a negative person bc it looks like hes mocking her to me, but i understand how its supposer to be interpreted
i love that
BFF’s
I like how she does the Dreams Works face 24/7
My friends just say “nice tits” 

It’s funny and supportive
The best revenge on those who scoff and hate and point is to live your best life, achieve your goals, and show them your tenacity to never give up on yourself!
Look at the text at the start compared to the later on text. Its been altered
I think thats the joke. At first it looks like he’s teasing but in the end you see he’s supportive
I think the original was supposed to be the guy being transphobic and at the end he didnt know it was the same person (not 100% sure it was the original but I do remember one like this)
I think it’s a bonehurtimgjuice
You're not reading it wrong, the last panel's dialogue was changed to be more wholesome lolol. Pretty sure it was originally him being shocked and finding her attractive, but in this case it was changed to sexualize her less.
its an edit of the original. so you're reading the guy character correctly.
The only thing different in the original is that in the last panel he just says “nice” and she doesn’t say anything, thankfully the original is not transphobic
""more funnier"" is linguistically redundant
I had this happen in school accidentally. My bullies started calling me queer as an insult, and a lot of the other kids started doing it, too.

They thought that they were being hurtful, but it was actually one of the best parts of my day.
Any kind of support is welcome
there's a unified design philosophy across bikes made for small children? and it's this specific?!
the glittery streamers and the basket are usually found on “girl bikes”.

which is dumb imo, where are boys supposed to store shit??
Only in some countries
As far as I know, you have puberty blockers to delay your puberty, and then you start HRT later when you're older and able to make judgement.
So?
Edit: I'd heard this a few times... so I looked it up. And I was right. Someone said this much more succinctly: ""Living well is the best revenge"" -George Herbert
Fuck yeah! 🌟
It's an edit, the original comic had a different punchline I think
I think it’s the pack of commas that does it for me. “Nice, girl [anything]” sounds a lot more supportive in the “wow that’s nifty” kind of way
Thank you for that. :)

I was concerned the original was either transphobic or him unduly sexualising her.
If you're gonna nitpick strangers' grammar, then you should at least use correct capitalization and punctuation. :)
if it's redundant then why did the author say it anyway? because it was the simplest word to express a stronger form of the word ""funnier"". In another language, they might have doubled the word instead (""funnier funnier"") instead of using the word ""more"". Both uses are ""redundant"", but still useful for expressing one's thoughts.
It’s more funnier that way
You’re redundant
ur linguistically redundant aye goteem
Afaik, the dip is there to accomodate skirts and dresses, so it could more accurately be called a ""skirt bike""
Yea, it's kinda fucked up when you think about it.

Have you tried finding pockets on women's clothing?? Lol even my work shirts have pockets for guys but jone for girls. It's infuriating.
No, we don't.
Though the original punchline is just ""Nice."", implying that he finds her very attractive, so... Somewhat decent?
Yeah the bottom panels font is different
It's more incorrecter

Yes, it is :) [Here](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Knd0QwAwBpj_x_LLW_zQlQHaVt%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=ec96b2364a21c5c871cf5ffc08bd335aa0799069a5f1930e84bcbf8756720261&ipo=images) is the original!

It feels so good to finally be happy in my own skin 😊 (20y, 3mo HRT)		"Wow youre beautiful. Im beyond jealous of you. Id love to hear your story how you decided to transition and how your journey is going so far
Legit reposted this like 3 times cause I kept fucking up the title soooo sorry :p
Three months or three years? Damn girl you look good. It's been 4.5 months for me and I hardly look any different.
Excuse me, three *months?*
Gorgeous !!!😊
stunning! love that for you
So glad for you. I wish continued happiness
Looking fit! I'm so happy for you and that is my favorite color nail polish!
It's amazing, isn't it? You look terrific, I'm glad you're happy <3
I mean, filter or no, you look INSANE for three months!
Honestly I would be in tears if I came out looking as good as that. I feel like where I am currently, I’ll never reach a goal like that. No matter how positive I stay I just cant imagine reaching that point. You should be so happy to be that good looking and honestly I almost want to break into tears looking at you. I know I’m a far ways away as I’m still closeted except with my friends, but anyone who teaches a goal like this seriously has some witchcraft. Keep going on and be happy! 💗💗💗
EDIT: I just noticed you said your only 3 months on her and I just wanna know what you are doing more that anything. You are a work a art and magic!
Congrats. I just passed the 3mo mark myself (34y,MtF) and goodness it's amazing to feel happy in my own body.

Like, tbh, I hope you have many, many years of happiness and peace in your life.

Peace n love always!

Edited... cuz I wanted to say all that was on my mind
I will be honest I have made a negative comment like ""boring"" I thought she was one of these monotype Girls making useless and everytime same selfie. I fully trapped in and I deleted that. She is very beautiful...no discussion
Maybe random q but how tall are you? You look stunning btw
How do I get shoulders like yours? 😭🥲 you’re so pretty. It’s been two years and I look like a skinny guy with boobs. Rip.
it took me too long to realize YOU are 20 years old, not that you've been 20 years on HRT XD But congratulations! You look great!
Looking good.... But... Not your room
Congrats on HRT and yay for the validation! You know what they say about starting hormones, though.

If you feel yourself becoming and staying hot for longer than four hours, see a doctor.

If you feel yourself becoming and staying hot for longer than 24 hours, come see me.

You might wanna make an appointment. In your case, I’ll take walk-ins 😉
Beautiful thing, feeling of knowing who you are and living that! You look awesome!
Clean your room

You look Amazing
Only 3 months?!?! I’m eternally jealous.
Good for you!!! It is an amazing feeling isn’t it? Was for me and still is.
Wow so cute😍
Yeah girl!!!
I’m jelly. At 3mo I still looked like my old self
You’re stunning!
I can’t wait to see what happens to me at 21! (Starting on the 27th!)
🔥
You look so pretty! that tan line on the arm tho reminds me of when I worked as an hvac assistant during summer few years ago
Girl, you really are transition goals! I'm glad you're happy~ I wish I'll look as good as you one day. <3
You are amazing girl!  Strong and beautiful!
Perfect body though
U look so good qwq
I wanna be that pretty too!! D: sooo jealous!
YOOOOOOOOO does E develop your chest that well, that quick????
NICE
You look amazing
Really really amazing. Really very beautiful. 🥰😍🤩
Happy for you! 🤗
So pretty! 😍
Good for you!  You look amazing!
Damn❤😍🤩
Soooo happy for you, girl!! I’m almost there, 2 months in and finally starting to see some change. ☺️
So happy for you!
That floor definitely looks like a ladies room. 
Also you look good
Congrats on your 3 months … you look so happy
Oooo la la 🤩
You’re gorgeous omg 😊
And wow, you are stunning, great clothes choice.
You should you look good!!
Wow, I never wouldda guessed you were trans! You pass so well! Very girly! 💛
Only 3 months in??? I’m 3 months in rn, I refuse to believe that, you look so pretty, and you are really lucky, where are my boobs and butt???

But seriously, congratulations
Wooow u are more beautiful than cis girls in my class gonna start hrt in 11 months I hope at the end i ll be the same as you)
I genuinely did a double-take to make sure I read the subreddit correctly.  You're absolutely stunning!
I agree I wanna know what I can do as I’m in a tough spot where I’m still very closeted, but also just am scared to do anything because I’m afraid I’ll never look this good… some people just have some witchcraft
Unacceptable. Bad girl, get outta here 🙃
I hear that, I'm 4.5 months in and just look like an effeminate boy...
“I’ll have what she’s having”
Thank you so much for the kind words 🥺 You can totally do it, I believe in you! (Although just be sure you’re not transitioning for the looks, but for the mind ya know)

And honestly just fake it till you make it lol, Thats what I’ve been doing for the longest time tbh (don’t tell anyone :p) There are many many MANY ways you can go for the look you want for relatively cheap without even going on Hormones :)
5’8 :p Thank you!!
And from the profile, it looks like she only recently turned 20 too so it’s amazing progress for such a short time!
Blame it on the fish
I prefer the far less responsible route of blaming it on my fish and taking a nap instead 😭
Yes, you are.
It really is amazing, I used to cry like every morning, but now I wake up with the biggest smile :p
Thank you! I’ve been doing landscaping at a golf course the past few years soooo yeah tan lines are fun :p
I mean wtf this is unbelievable amazing
you can't decide based on whether you'll be pretty or not, you have to decide based on which path causes you less pain

most people don't pass that good after 3 months hrt and I certainly don't btw
My issue is I've worked construction and warehouse jobs as well as doing some powerlifting a long time ago so I have a lot of muscle. Once that fades away and I lose some male pattern fat I think I'll be doing much better.
Omg yes 😭😭
Thanks and I appreciate all the tips! I’m trying to make it through but I know I’m not taking them just for looks, I just feel like I’ll never make it to a point like you with the looks which discourages me. Thank go all the support and I hope you do well! Seriously you look amazing! 💗💗
You're welcome! And omg 5'8 you look so tall here!! Great camera work ^^
Start charging the fish rent
[deleted]
😉😁🤩
Of course! I just look through the plastic.
I mean ik that but sometimes I think that taking it would be a mistake because besides that fact it would fix some things, I feel like it would mess me more up that anything. I’m just rly un happy rn as I’m closeted socially except around my friends so I can’t do much… I know if I were to get the option I’d take it anyways, just that I would wish it would give me the same results as some people. Can’t decide that though so I just have to hope…
I get it! I’ve been extremely active in mostly running based sports for years now, and I’ve been working in landscaping for 2 years on a golf course (hence the terrible farmers tan).

I just decided to say screw it and so my best lol. But thank you for the kind words! I believe in you :p
Thank you 😊😊 And if you want shoot me a message on snapchat! I’ll share some advice I’ve found out the hard way :p
This wasn't exactly about the room.. but the person in it.
yea hrt definitely shouldn't be a first step, especially if you think it will 'mess you up', 
I think the common thing is you should be in full girl mode for like 6 months before medically transitioning
Hey thanks for that! I appreciate you wanting to help! We are all trying to get there and I just really feel like I can’t make it anywhere…
No I understand that. I move looked into a ton of the things and I know all the risks but I’m just saying if I could take it, I would. My only fear is that I wouldn’t get the results I want on my body as much as others have.
It's not that common of a thing. I started hrt like 8 months before I publicly came out, although I was out to my friends a couple years prior
That's how I felt - mostly through doubts and stuff, but I inched into it socially in presentation.   


Some people were getting the hint, and things started feeling way too right. I literally can't imagine going back
Of course! Just DM me your snap and i’ll add you lol
what's stopping you? most people can get it if they go through the process (or ship it from thailand or something)
yeah most people never will pass

probably like 80-95% of trans women will be easily clocked, I think trans dudes have a bit better odds though so good luck to the guys
same here tbh, I sorta knew from the start though and titrated my parents onto it over one or two years
Thanks, actualy my snap is the same as my Reddit, zaneicez!
Well I’m not an adult yet, and I’m sure my parents reaction to something of this would not be very happy… trust me, if I could, I would. But mainly I’m holding out until I move out and figure out things then. Until then, it will be little things like getting some nice clothes and just talking with my friends. Thanks for all the help thought i appreciate all the support! Also, I do know of the fact you can get it without a prescription but I almost feel as if doing it by talking with a therapist is better, besides the fact I already need therapy.
I really don't trust those stats whatsoever.

Also yeah, trans guys do end up passing better on average than transfem people and hormones, but I definitely don't think it's 80 to 95 of trans woman who get easily clocked.
Therapy is super helpful, for anyone in any situation! I totally understand your situation, I was closeted until I moved out as well. At home I would constantly have my door locked just so I could wear what I want, it got to the point where my parents almost ripped my door off. I believe in you though! Just stay in there and do what makes YOU happy, not others :)
always do whatever choice makes you most comfortable in your life, you can get it underage though I started at 17 through the legal route

diy hrt is pretty safe tbh though I'd say about 60% of trans ppl I know go that route, you just have to test your levels very very often and super slowly up the dose over literally years
oh I'm not citing a study or something I'm just saying my random thoughts
Yeah sometimes I wish I had therapy anyways, just to talk over problems but not sure how I could get my parents to get me some, beside the fact they would most likely be against that. Also I would lock my door but I had an old one that broke and my parents just never bothered to replace it, and they just never allowed us to use locks because they are very snoopy like that… I spend most of my time away from my parents though so I’d say that’s good enough and I have times to feel like myself. I’m trying to hang in there but luckily there is subs like this that are so nice and supportive, along with some great irl friends who either have similar experiences or support me through it. Thanks so much thought and have a good day!!! 💗💗💗
I'm too stubborn to do stuff like that I just did what I wanted and eventually my folks molded to be accepting
See you can start when you are under 18, but you need parental consent which would come along with counseling and such. My parents I know won’t support me as I have heard very often their views on the community and how they feel about trans women. It’s going to hard to do nothing for a few years still but if I can make it I’m a free bird! I have also looked into diy already and know how a lot of it works but thanks for the help anyways! You are truly a great helper in this world 💗💗💗
I would say that's probably an incredible harmful thing to say then. Def don't think that's the case by far.
uh thanks I guess
idk that's just my experience and I look like sh*t myself so that also kinda sways my opinion"	qbyqj6	trans	3237	0.95	2021-10-20 11:32:40

Honestly all the credit goes to my sister, plus the pads in them really help a lot
I honestly don’t know what I would do without them, I am super lucky to have them all be so supportive

I know how that feels, I took me a while to come out and feel comfortable enough to actually try on a dress, wish you the best of luck

In-laws showed up to our door unannounced after learning I am trans (MtF)	"Some background before I begin, my wife and I have been together for 8 years and married for 3. Her parents are incredibly conservative, outwardly racist and clearly homophobic. They do not know we are married; it was a courthouse marriage done for paperwork reasons, and we plan to have our 'real' wedding later. Her parents do not know this, as my wife assumed they would not take it well. For the last few years I have been on a bit of a process of self discovery, which led to the realization that I am trans, and I began HRT about 7-8 months ago. My wife and I have talked a lot about our relationship and the challenges and changes that transitioning can bring about, and we are happier now than ever, and plan to stay together.

&#x200B;

This past Sunday, my wife decided (after months of planning) to finally tell her mom about me transitioning on her weekly phone call. We expected this to go poorly, and our expectations were met. Basically, they don't view trans people as people, and don't believe that it would be possible for us to ever be happy together. Her mom was convinced that I would leave her for a man, highly unlikely given that I'm a lesbian (and we're married). Her mom cut her out of the family, saying anyone who wants to be with a trans person can't be a part of her family. Obviously this was sad and disappointing, but not unexpected.

&#x200B;

Monday (the next day) was my wife's birthday, so I made her meals and gave her gifts when she wrapped up working from home that day, a little before 5. We had just finished unwrapping when there was a knock at the door, and I saw her mom's frizzled hair from the window. I was in running shorts and a t-shirt with no bra, no makeup, and no shower after working out, so in no way fit to talk to people who have never seen me as a woman. Mind you, they also live 60-90 minutes away, so this was clearly a planned trip. When my wife answered the door, they walked right into the house and demanded to speak with both of us immediately. I was hiding in our laundry so as not to be seen, and begged my wife to make them wait outside or in their car for 10-15 minutes while I got ready. Eventually they moved to our front porch, where they stood staring into the windows.

&#x200B;

I went upstairs, tried to calm myself and change clothes, then went down to deal with them. They were waiting on the front porch, and when I opened the door to walk out, they refused to back up or give any room, so we were extremely close to each other. Now, I will tell you, I had kinda always expected something like this. I have never shared that I am very progressive in my politics, but over the years I have known them, they have always worked to push my buttons. I typically don't speak when we are all together, and they have never seen me actually behaving like myself. Tbh, they have no clue who I really am, and never cared to know. I figured one day they would push me over the edge, but I always thought I would be able to control myself and my emotions. Please know, dear reader, that when I tell you what happened next, that I have no hate for people who alter their appearance for happiness. Clearly, I am willing to do the same, given the amount of HRT, hair removal, and makeup I go through on the reg. But when I opened that door and stepped outside, the first words out of my MIL's mouth were, ""Nice breasts"". Almost immediately and without thinking, I scoffed and said, ""Well, at least mine are real.""

&#x200B;

So that's how the conversation started. Everyone gasped and took a step back (except me, since my back was already on the door). I think she was extremely taken aback, as she has never known me to talk back, nor do I think she was aware that I knew she had a boob job (they're not big). But I think it surprisingly made everyone calm down a bit, as she realized she wasn't ready for an insult fight. For the next 5-10 minutes, she talked about how we are terrible, lying children, and could never understand the pain we were causing her as a mother. They said that there was no way my wife could make the decision to stay with me, as she couldn't view it objectively since she was in a relationship with me. They tried to convince us not to get married (bit late on that one, lol) because, as they put it, ""it's only a 50-50 shot this even works out"", and that I couldn't decide until I'd ""finished all that transition stuff"". They said it was fine for me to decide to live a perverted lifestyle myself, but immoral to bring their daughter into it, and that my wife's mother had the right to tell her what to do. My wife was amazingly calm, and made it clear that she could make her own independent choices as an adult, and that we were very happy together. All the calm logic in the world wouldn't help, though, as my MiL is nuts.

&#x200B;

Then came the real anger. My MiL said that her sister was threatening to strangle me with her bare hands, and to 'just wait and see what happens when I tell the rest of the family'. She then took out some cheap-ass dishware that I assume she was going to give as a gift, and started throwing it on our porch to break, screaming that this is what I was doing to her family and her mind. She said that her mind was broken, and that she couldn't control what came out of it, and that I should be worried for what that might mean for me. After breaking all the dishes (or trying, she isn't very strong so some of the dishes survived), she said ""clean up your mess"". I responded that it wasn't my mess, it was hers, but that since I was a reasonable adult that I would clean it up for her, and not call the cops if she left. That really got her going, as she started screaming that she was not afraid to go to jail, that I should call the cops and see what happens. At this point, her husband, who had remained relatively calm, began to physically drag her away to their car whilst saying, ""you promised not to go crazy... You promised not to lose your mind!"" She was raving the whole way to the car, foaming at the mouth and all. Not a pretty sight.

&#x200B;

We cleaned up the dishes and tried to decompress after. In hindsight, I'm super glad we made her leave the house before talking to her, as she clearly had planned this to happen in our home. I think she probably would have broken our own possessions as well, given the lack of control she had. I was extremely proud of my wife for handling herself so well, and surprised at my own lack of control in the moment. Guess the lesson is that it's really hard to control 8 years of pent up anger, harder than I would've thought. Luckily, I only responded in kind, and never even thought of getting physical or yelling. We haven't heard much else from them, other than one ""damn her"" text from the MiL on the way home (which, honestly, props for using the correct pronouns, I wasn't expecting that). We have been cut out of any wills, family events (thank god, they sucked), or contact, but since we never relied on them for money or anything else, there's no real effect here. Now I won't have to plan and pay for their funerals when they die.

&#x200B;

PS- I have nothing against anyone getting a boob job. If I weren't happy with mine, I'd totally consider it, but for some reason my mouth managed its own response in this situation.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Angry parents ambushed us at our house, screamed and broke things until they were dragged away. They ended up looking like fools, and we're still a happily married couple.

&#x200B;

Edit: My wife filed a police report yesterday, we may pursue a no contact order or something similar, but we have put up a security camera and arranged some pepper spray around the house for quick and easy access. Naturally, if I ever hear from her again, I will update all of you accordingly!"	"Proud of both of you for handling yourselves the way you did. It's very brave to stand your ground especially around parents. So I commend you on your strength. I'm also happy to see your positive takes from this experience. Though I am sad that this is something you two had to deal with. Thank you sis for sharing this. I think it speaks volumes to those that are looking for the courage to be their authentic selves. Hugs and kisses. All the best on your ""wedding day"". My wife are in a similar boat on that front. We married in the courthouse for papers and our love as we couldn't wait, and have our 'wedding' planned for this September. No more taking off my wedding band. It hurts so bad to hide that.
Whoa, that's literally the craziest thing that I've read in a while!

You should think about posting this to r/insaneparents.
Omfg ""at least mine are real"" best response lol
Yeah the MiL needs… something… probably a psychiatric hospital stay if I’m honest. Yikes.

So glad you two are okay! 💙
> “*props for using the correct pronouns*”

I lol’d

These guys are nuts, hope you and your wife are okay OP.
Honestly fuck your FIL for driving your MIL all the way there with plates to smash and then trying to say ""you promised not to go crazy"" like he didn't know exactly what she was going to do. He just wants someone else to blame when he dies alone in a cut-rate retirement home
As someone about to get top augmentation surgery, I personally gotta say I nearly pissed myself laughing imagining your quick and witty response, don't feel one bit bad about it.
I would have lost my shit when she stormed into the house. 

I used to be incredibly patient. This story only validates why we shouldn’t tolerate anything. Long before she appeared on your doorstep unannounced she made it clear she doesn’t respect either of you. 

I would call the police, and at least file a report. It would be nice to have that on record in case it happens again. Tho I would imagine when her local police knock on her door, and explain what she did wrong, it will most likely stop her from doing this ever again. If you don’t, she will most likely come back and do it again. Maybe even behave worse.
You're calmer and you're wife is calmer than I'd ever be if someone insulted my fiancée for being trans. Time for a restraining order! I doubt this is the last time MIL will go bonkers on your doorstep. Expect more. What a nut job. Sounds like my fiancees birth mom! We cut contact with her.
Good for you and your wife!  You are both so lucky to have each other.  

TBH you should probably report her uttering threats to the police anyways.  At the least they will go over to her house and put a little fear into her rage driven brain, and create a paper trail if anyone does ever try physical violence.  Don't underestimate crazy, it's always worse than you think.

My wife and I are in a similar position.  I haven't come out to anyone but my wife, and both our parents are religious.  My dad is fairly progressive but her parents are openly racist, sexist, homophobic, hateful people who only like people who are exactly like them.
[deleted]
Doubt I would have been able to remain calm in a situation like that, super impressive. May you and your wife's relationship only get stronger through this.
Wow. That's incredible, but sadly too believable. The nerve of them to do this on her birthday. Y'all handled it awesomely. I sincerely hope to demonstrate the same strength if ever forced to deal with something similar. Good for the both of you, stay strong and solidarity!
Proud of you and your wife standing up for yourselves

They can suck an ass for the way they treat you but you are valid no matter what :) 🏳️‍⚧️
Honestly this is pretty comedic, makes it clear who’s really the problem. Sorry you’re having to go through all this though ! Glad you have such a sweet supportive wife 💖
And transphobes will say trans people are mentally ill


Sheeeeesh 🙄



In all seriousness I’m so sorry you had to go through something like that, at least the trash took itself out though.
Proud of your wife and you for not putting up with the MIL's bull, and your initial comeback had me cackling. It's hard to stand up to family sometimes, but it seems like your wife and you are a great support to each other, so I guess it's easier that way.
Stay safe, OP, and congrats on the two of you getting that kind of toxicity out of your life. Much love to you both!
“At least mine are real”
*GREAT ENEMY FELLED*
About the boob job comment… I’m enby and took HRT briefly. A relative told me changing how I looked was not god’s plan. She had a breast reduction surgery the previous month since it was causing her back pain. And I looked at her and said “well god didn’t plan for you to have smaller breasts but that didn’t seem to stop you”
You get all the hugs OP. Way to stick it out. And a little bit of sass looks good on you girly
I think you handled it nicely. I want to encourage you to stay nice towards them. They can treat you like shit but they can‘t force you to dirty your hands as well.
I'd get a restraining order against them lol.
I kept expecting a ""and that's when [you/your wife] punched the bitch in the mouth,"" turns out you're more composed than me!
She sounds like a  grandiose narcissist, I love the dish she brought to demonstrate what you are doing to her. She says you are doing this to her family but she really means herself and her idea of what a family is. 

You handled yourselves perfectly, that one smart retort about her fake breasts put her back on her heels, she was not expecting that at all.. why ? Because she felt so %100  confident in her moral highgound she was thrown by your calling her on her imperfect world
I hope you both have endless happiness out of spite for such lowly creatures that shouldn’t even be compared to human.
This makes me so angry. Hopefully you can go no contact.
""At least mine are real""  
GOD THAT'S AMAZING

you go girl, don't feel bad about it, i probably would have said something worse
Ummm… If I ever become so narcissistic and bigoted that I hop in a car, ambush my daughter and try to destroy her relationship ON HER *FUCKING* BIRTHDAY, please dump me into a pool of lava. The sheer audacity of this woman, good grief.
You promised not to go crazy! You promised not to lose your mind!

🤣 Poor guy he probably just wanted to stay home and watch some sport ball too
that was really great and satisfying to read.
well done
Whoa. Great job keeping yourself together. I don’t know how I would react in that sort of situation. Also, nice burn!
You need to get no contact orders of protection against the entire family asap. They will try this again. They will step it up. They are insane, violent, and very dangerous.
Wow that's fucking insane!

Side note: I enjoy the way you wrote everything down. You reminded me of a character in a book , in a good way.
1. Proud of you for responding this way!! As calm as I am generally, if my MiL (or my own mother) acted liked that, I’d be hysterical.

2. I don’t think a response to “nice boobs” (I rolled my eyes so hard when I read that) required anything more polite that how you put it. 
Don’t dish it out if you can’t take it!
Honestly this was kind of nice to hear for a vent. I mean that experience probably was anything but pleasant and your wife maybe doesn't feel too good about her relationship with her parents, but other than that it sounds pretty positive with you two continuing your loving marriage and them straight up making fools of themselves. 
That boob line may be a bit harsh for anyone not deserving of it and I get the feeling of regretting not being able to hold your tongue but in that situation it kinda was a killer comeback. (And as you said it even took the wind out of her sails for a bit.)

Can only wish you two the best ❤✌
So sorry you had to deal with this but it sounds like you both handled it amazingly well. Your MIL is a not a healthy human and, honestly, I just feel bad for her that she can be so corrupted and disconnected from reality. 

I was in a similar situation where my partner's parents were not kind. My recommendation is to support your partner as much as possible and keep communicating. This is likely a very hard time for them. 

I love your boob comment and good on you. With irrationality, sometimes dishing some creative language is the only way to defend yourself and stifle a dangerous situation. 

I'm sending you and your partner all the best, and please be safe!
Funny thing is i had this happen but with my own parents they drove 6 hours to my place while my wife was home and i was at work so when i got home they tried to get me to move back and talk to a pastor lmao
Please take care of yourselves. I can’t believe people still behave like this. It’s 2022 ffs 😢 

Why can’t people let other be who they want and live who they want. X
It’s really nice to see that your spouse continues to support you in the face of their family. That is an incredibly challenging thing for someone to do. Even when their family comprises of psychotic cunts.
As someone who cut their parents out of their lives 7 years ago I would advise your wife to do the same. You can love your parents with all their faults and also have zero relationship with them. It’s not worth either of your mental health to have to deal with people like that. Just because someone is family doesn’t give them the right to treat you poorly. It’s truly liberating once you do it and realize how much stress is reduced in your life. If family truly loved you they would disagree with your choices but at the same time respect them and not act like this. I hope both of you have a great life together.
How did you manage to not burst out laughing when they said not to get married?
That is unfortunately - there is an increase of fascism, racist and cynicism growing in out country - glad you still together and let us hope progressive thinking wins this what I see war
Holy woah. Those are some wild in laws. I’m so sorry that happened to you - but major kudos to you and your wife for taking it so well!
Also your MIL sounds totally batshit MY GOD 😅
It's these kinds of stories that make me terrified to come out, and have no idea how to get HRT and not be homeless. You are amazing to have been able to put up with that crazy bitch, and I hope you never have to experience this again
op that was the best clap back.
While there’s nothing wrong with the boob job, the comment was certainly well placed. Seems to have shaken up her own confidence a bit, and told her that this wasn’t going to be a situation where she’d just be able to say or do anything she wanted. Shifted the power to you. So I think it was a good thing to have said anyway.
This is obviously a horrible thing to deal with but my takeaways from this are all positive. You sound like you are happy in your journey of self discovery and your identity and relationship and you have great support from your wife. That is the most important and is inspiring to read and makes me happy. Second you stood your ground without getting too aggressive or physical. It sounds like the incident could’ve gone way worse and you handled it great. So did your wife. Plus now you have all these pent up feelings getting a bit of release, they saw the real you and you don’t have to pretend any more. Also you seem to have cut ties with a toxic relationship for your wife and yourself. Just be sure your wife gets whatever support she needs cause it’s her family, but I’m confident you are already doing that. I hope you feel all the positives from this and take pride in your strength and your marriage and your future. A lot of times I read stories on here that make me worried or sad for the person and this just made me happy and inspired and optimistic for your future! I wish you and your wife all the best for your lives together though I don’t even think you really need any help, you seem to be doing great.
Sorry you had to go through this. On the bright side, your wife sounds awesome!
>""at least mine are real""

OP you are my new hero
Maybe I'm so used to managing other people's feelings but if I was in your shoes my first priority would be to make sure my wife is okay.

I am estranged from toxic family that gets explosive like this and it takes years and years to process the trauma. Their transphobia is in no way excusable and I think you did a fantastic job of showing that you won't be pushed around for their stupid ideals. 

Take care of yourself, then take care of your wife. She lost her parents today. Even if she felt like she lost them a long time ago, the day I made my estrangement official changed how I felt quite dramatically, even though I already wasn't talking to them or sharing anything. 

I'm glad you're okay and the MIL stopped when she did. Monsters.
And they call us dramatic 😭
Is it really loading control when you planned to do it hours in advance?

I mean, it sounds like the FiL believed she wasn't gonna, but she knew she was gonna have a fit when she bought those plates.
Personally not bodyshaming is only for people, and bigots aren’t people
Love the ""atleast mine are real"" comment, best I've gotten to use is "" atleast mine are fresh and perky, untouched by the hands of dozens""
""Nice boob job"" I just love that special brand of misogyny cis women reserve for trans women.
Your wife is an absolute boss!!  Wow

Also unbelievable catty instincts 🔥

The boob zing was sooooo solid
well. congrats on both of you for staying reasonably calm and mature in that situation, im glad neither of you were injured and that you dont rely on them for anything at all.

i hope your wife had a nice enough birthday despite that, and hope that she isnt too emotionally hurt by her family xx
Wooow. You're a hero, OP!
Honestly you should notify the police about this and get some kind of incident report just so you have a paper trail started in case she decides to do something even more unhinged.
Doesn’t sound like you lost control. Sounded like you honestly and clearly stated your boundaries.
Oh goodness sending hugs and astral projected tacos!  I am sorry you had to go through this
That’s awesome that you and your wife stick by each other like that. I don’t think I could have been this calm if someone insulted my fiancé. We are both mtf, and I know my parents are very conservative, so I have not even told them about our relationship yet. Much love sis.
Yall handled it perfectly! 

I would get done house cameras. We have blink from Amazon after my brother went off the deep end. It’s reasonably affordable compared to what’s on the market and motion activated, hooked to WiFi and you use an app on your phone. 

Unfortunately there is no reasoning with these people and your safety (and your wife’s) is paramount.  It wouldn’t surprise me if she comes back and does property damage.
Amazing story. Good luck with the rest of your transition
I would also add that the one thing I hate about this which in fact may hurt your wife but does makes your decision easier is that your MIL is putting her moral values and judgments above her daughter, they are more important then her daughter. They never got to know you at all before they found out. And they just bring the hammer down on both of you with no attempt at trying to understand who you are and what you are doing. It's all very impersonal to you and it's all about her.
Good for both of you! You each stood up and didn’t tolerate what was being thrown your way! Now if I could do the same and stand my ground with my in laws…le sigh. I’m FtM and yeah…they don’t approve of it. I met my wife before I started transitioning too, took them awhile to get used to their daughter being with a woman! Anyway!

Proud of you! Keep it up and don’t take anyones crap! 🧡
Holy fuck, that’s awful of them. Absolute Trash Bags™️, full stop. Kudos to you and your wife, the strength and perseverance you two have is a testament to real love. 🏳️‍⚧️😎
I just wanna say congratulations on standing your ground. Screw that crazy lady.
Oh. My. God.

I absolutely lost it at your father in law saying *""You promised not to go crazy"".*
And this is exactly what I'd be afraid of my parents doing if they ever found out. We certainly can't choose our family, but you'd think our family would choose us over their ignorant bigotry. I'm sorry you had to go through that, but it seems like you and your wife are handling it just fine so far. 💜
Kinda sounds worth getting a restraining order against the people who might be physically dangerous to you. I wouldn't expect police to take action for a ""family member showing up to your house"" unless you can also say they're not allowed to by law. You could diffuse the threat by telling those people that the restraining order is just for your safety, and if they want to bridge the gap, you can talk about it over text.

It is better to be safe than sorry
So sorry you had to deal with that. 

Honestly it sounds like you handled it incredibly well. Props. Not sure I would be able to remain that calm and reasonable.
Wow!!  That woman is a serious nut job.  Credit to you for standing your ground and refusing to be bullied.
I'd look into an order of protection. This doesn't sound like it will de-escalate. Sounds like she's rallying the troops for round 2.
I was literally talking to my therapist about my birth family today, and how I would probably never be able to come out to them, as they attacked and still don't respect my ex, who came out as a trans man at the time. While I know for a fact that I would only be making things bad by telling them, it still hurts a little to think that I can't tell them and have supportive, loving, non-hateful family members to talk with, go shopping with and invite over to see thier new gorgeous (IMO) daughter and maybe help her find her new style.
did i miss the part where you “lost control”? as far as you’ve written you said a single thing to the MIL. you were as cool as a cucumber from what i read!
am so, so sorry you had to go through this nightmare. you are so incredibly resilient in the way you handled the situation, though! hoping for the best for you and your wife! 💜
Congrats on getting married! And honestly your clapbacks were great. ""At least mine are real"" is a banger.

On a scale from 1 to ""hackles raised,"" what's the likelihood of them following through on whatever threats your mil made in her meltdown? They sound like empty threats from a madwoman, but I want to be sure you two are proper safe.
Don't deploy pepper spray indoors, pro tip from a seasoned security guard, just taze them
Uhhhh i read some real threats of physical violence in there. If you're willing, able and can afford it... if it were me... id get a g*n and make a safety plan for who to call and where to go in case shit pops off
First co grats on coming out and I hope you have a good transition. Second atleast mine are real made me fucking laugh so hard
Fuck your parents. I laughed at ""Well at least mine are real"".
I mean your a woman soooo *swing her by the roots of her hair 😈*
I feel like these are the kind of people who actually need “conversion therapy” and by that i really just mean a proper education on why all of those assumptions are baseless and misunderstandings of who trans people are.
Well they seem to be threatening your well being so I would consider making preparations to defend yourself. It almost sounds like she is threatening to like get her family to attack you. If you live in a place where you can get learn firearm safety and your right about defending yourself and get a gun. If you can't get a gun maybe a knife or really anything. Cause they do seem to want you hurt.
Honestly this is why I'm not that into the whole family thing. My brother is an ass and if he shows up at my house I'm calling the cops. 

So disappointing. I'm glad you guys were prepared but I'm still sorry you had to go through that.
Shoulda called the cops
Thank you for sharing, it was educational!
That's awful! I can't understand how some people can be like that. Props to you two for staying strong during it all and let Love win! Also props to your writing skills. This was surprisingly easy to imagine. Ever considered writing as a profession?
I’m sorry you had to go through that. Also I’m oddly pleasantly surprised the dad was basically there to manage the mom and didn’t say much?
Hugs to you both!
Good response, 10/10 meow. Making us proud OP.
Woah sounds like something straight from a horror movie! Sorry you had to deal with that!
I am littrally going through the exact same thing now apart they found out off other people and now I’m the worlds worst and my gf is making the worst decision of her life blah blah blah
Tbh while my parents are homophobic for the most part  cus some people in my family are gay and I myself is Trans but hiding it. If someone did this to me I'd be the person saying they need to leave or I get the sniper to take the shot. Kinda like a way to avoid being followed
Wow. I'm impressed with how you handled the whole thing. I would have probably lost it. Lots of love and happiness to the both of you
Time to file a restraining order against them.
Just to let you know I'm happy for you both. And don't let people like your wife's mom and dad Get you down.
My goodness what a read! You handled that better than I would of (I only just came to the conclusion I am Trans, lots of things to think about) but your wife is amazing too! She handled that so well. It is never easy when family are not open-minded. My father (if he was still in the picture) would have lashed out badly. I commend you both on how that was addressed and wish you both a happy future together. Your comeback to her was sublime and by all means justified.
>She said that her mind was broken

She was not wrong. But it wasn't broken for the reasons she implied.
Word of advice: call the cops early.

It takes a minute for then to get to you and if things go south it’s better for them to already be on their way.

Cops would much, MUCH, rather deal with cases where they can intervene early and prevent paperwork from needing to be filed than fallout after-the-fact.

Stay safe
I am so sorry you both went through this. I think if this is really what her parents are like she could consider going no contact. That was straight-up narcissistic rage.
Yup, this is the craziest shit I've heard in a hot minute. Damn, girl. I'm so sorry. I hope y'all are hanging in there 💕
I’m not sure what country/area you’re from, but if it’s the US, please consider getting a gun. 

This woman is clearly planning on hurting you herself or pushing another family to do it for her.

A police order and pepper spray won’t do much if somebody shows up armed at your home looking to harm you and your wife.
This is more or less my biggest fear about being out to my extended family… I have a lunatic grandmother who has done things, including, but not limited to: kidnapping the bride at a wedding that she apposed, trying to get my parents to divorce (twice), and screaming at everyone in the household over me saying one swear word (damn) and leaving in a rush. I’m terrified that she would haul her ass up from the south just to try and stop me from being me.

I’m glad you made it out of this situation. I hope I don’t have to go through something similar.
Thank you for the kind words! Idk if this post will help anyone else, but it was nice to at least vent a bit. Moving forward, the best thing is we no longer have to hide who we are from anyone, and no more awful family gatherings! Last one I went to I lost like 5 pounds from anxiety induced nausea, which isn't something I've ever had before. I hope your wedding goes really well, and you get to wear whatever you want walking down the aisle!
Yeah, it probably does belong there, but I feel like this community might be able to relate to it as well. I don't think I've ever had someone hate me as vehemently as this woman does, so that's a new experience! We're locking our doors a lot more these days
Thanks for the award, btw! I don't think I've ever gotten one before, at least not one I know about, so that's pretty cool
Posting this to a non-trans sub will draw in the transphobes like vultures to a fresh carcass.
That is the harshest thing I've heard in a while but kinda deserved ngl.
Yeah, a psychiatrist said it sounds like she has some undiagnosed and untreated mental illness, but it's never good to diagnose second hand. Maybe this will cause her to get the help she needs, but probably not. That's her problem now, though!
I figure it'll be a few weeks/months before my heart rate stops skyrocketing every time there's someone walking past our house, but the relief from not having to deal with them will last forever!
Lol- kinda my thoughts as well, my wife had a point when she said that at least he was largely in control of his conduct and emotions, but I pointed out how low the bar is if being a slightly quieter bigot is all it takes to get praise.
My wife filed a police report yesterday, to basically do what you said and establish a record of her behavior. If something else does happen, hopefully that record will make any future legal actions easier. I don't plan on pursuing anything as long as she never comes back, but I'll still prepare!
My wife filed a report yesterday after we cooled off which was probably a good idea. I hope if/when you do end up having that conversation, they at least don't act violently!

One of my favorite parts of the conversation was when I described how the first time I met them, they were talking about how bs it was that the Confederate flag couldn't be flown above state capitol buildings, and her dad's response was that he didn't recall that event, but ""yeah, obviously we support it, we are conservatives"". I was like, yeah, so maybe you can see why we were hesitant to tell you guys at first?
One juicy bit I forgot to add, but you may appreciate. At one point, she gestured around us (to our house, flowers, plant stand, front yard, pride flag, etc) and asked, ""Does this look like happiness to you?"" My wife and I just laughed and were like, you mean living our lives in peace with friendly neighbors? Yeah, this definitely looks like happiness to us. She goes, ""well, it may look like that now, but give it time. Things can change!"" And I said, yes, HRT has been a lot of changes, and they've all been really positive! I've definitely become way happier, so I hope that change keeps on coming!
You're definitely right, it took some effort to not write a snarky text to her, but it's not worth stooping to her level.
That's the hope! Unfortunately that seems to be largely up to her, and she has nothing to do all day other than stew in her own anger, so idk what to expect. I know they own a gun, so I've got pepper spray strategically located throughout the house. Plus some fire extinguishers in case arson is afoot...
I was thinking this too, like how was mil able to text on the way home? Block block block
Oh, it was tough! Especially once I realized their main goal was to stop the wedding from happening, it just became so clear how impotent their rage was. Like, I couldn't help you if I wanted, it's too late. We already did the big gay
I agree, I am more shaken up by it than I thought I'd be, but it's definitely even more personal and tougher to process for my wife. It took my mom a while to come around, but her reaction was nothing like this, so I can only imagine how it feels when your own blood is saying things like that to you. We are helping each other as best we can, plus therapy, so I think we'll get through it!
I'm kinda wondering if I'll find some fresh paint on our house or cars. I'm pretty handy, so hopefully I can deal with any damage she tries to cause, but we did also set up a camera and we're locking the doors all the time now, and the dogs are on high alert!
Yeah, I've certainly considered it, but honestly idk if I can justify the cost at the moment. I did put pepper spray all over the house, plus our dogs are kinda scary, so I'm hoping that plus home field advantage will play in our favor. Plus she's got bad joints, so I think I've got her beat 100% if we take it to the ground

That was my wife's reaction as well, he definitely had some opinions of his own but managed to keep his cool. If he hadn't been there, I doubt she would have left so soon or so easily, so probably good that he was!
Wow, yeah, that's very intense! Honestly I just don't see where they get the energy to be so damn angry. Not caring is the easiest thing to do! I hope you don't have to deal with her, she sounds like a menace
You’re probably right tbh. I wouldn’t venture too far out of trans spaces with trans stories. Because there are a lot of people on Reddit who want to make our lives permanently miserable or worse.
Yeah unfortunately I've already seen that sub in particular side with bigoted parents of trans kids/adults and giving them all the unwarranted uwus of ""ooohh but it's a big change for them give them time,"" so I would definitely stear clear of posting this to other subs. Alas. It does have very r/justnomil vibes too tho lol. 

Anyways, proud of both you and your wife, OP. You did good.
If you don't have security cameras, now might be a good opportunity to install some and a setup to store footage so you can keep an eye on things both remotely and to have a paper trail in case the MIL escalates things or contacts some irrational male relatives to harass y'all.
NP, yinz earned that:)

Stay safe!
Too true! Can’t help people who don’t want to be helped.
Maybe some outdoor cameras would be a good measure? Then if they ever show back up again, just immediately call the cops. :( I’m sorry you’re in this hypervigilant state because of her craziness. That shit is the worst…
Yeah it really is a low bar. Though if nothing else, at least them each reacting in that way led to the conversation ending before it went further. Your FIL being quiet and perhaps a bit embarrassed probably saved you a lot of headache.

If they both flipped out things could get scary, and if they both tried to be quiet but condemning, you could be dealing with passive aggressive bs for weeks on end before it reached a boiling point.

Wish you guys luck and mad respect to your wife for standing up for herself, her decisions and for you. It's horrible what her parents are doing to her by making this an issue at all and it takes a good backbone to recognize it's them, not her, not you, in the wrong here.

Side note, I'd be super tempted to use the shards of those plates to make some cool artsy thing after painting them with trans colors just to spite your MIL. xP
Sounds like you handled everything the best way possible. Hopefully you’re done with that bs.

Thats incredibly scary jesus christ. Id suggest buying a gun if you think they are that serious about harming u lile thay
“We already did *the big gay*”

My favourite Reddit quote to ever exist
Did you get to rub that in their faces?!? Oh I wish you had recorded their faces if so!! 

I'm so sorry lovely that this is happening. But you and your wife sound awesome and wonderfully supportive of each other. 💜
I would get a couple more cameras. The proof will help should anything happen.  Please stay safe!
You could install dummy cameras and motion sensor lights, those are cheap and can be enough to make someone think twice. Maybe reinforce the doors with a second deadbolt

Whoa! A yinzer! Have an Imp n Arn on me! 😁
I think it's a possibility, unlikely but plausible. I plan to tell the neighbors as well so they know what to look out for.
How did you make it MORE american
Yup. I’ve seen a lot of users experience that. I knew my my home state and town’s subs would be a toxic cesspit. So I don’t even bother. 

Too bad too. I’m sure I could meet a lot of wonderful queer people on there.

It's also a bad idea to frequent your home town subs on your main account (especially if you're queer) so that bigots can't pinpoint where you live

I’m convinced Estrogen is magic!!I’m actually so happy with my body now!!! 😊💕 (even if I did gain 30lbs)		"Also the hair is fake, no way I could grow it out that fast 😂not entirely fake, just extensions._.
Look at those hips! 🤌🏻
I wish I'd gain 30 lbs. 

1 year in,and I lost 15...

You look fantastic
Honestly gaining weight while on estrogen is a good thing!!! Healthy body fat percentages are ~10% higher for cis women than cis men, because of how fat cells accumulate in the body. Having more fat on the hips/thighs gives people a more ""womanly"" shape :)
You look like a cute lesbian couple lmao
prettyyyy!!! obsessed
I mean no offense by this, but damn... You look good in *both* pictures... But I'm so glad you're comfortable in your body now :3
I WANT TOO... waiting for this is so hard. 
Very cute btw
Your hips. Hand them over 😡
You go girl!
Can't wait to be able to do HRT. Does it cost anything?
hey i wanted to know, is gaining weight during HRT good?

im already a bit heavier then i would want (though im at a healthy weight at my height, i just dont wanna go above what i should be). Should i try and lose weight before i start? Should i try and lose DURING?
30 pounds in the right places....Good luck in your journey.
What an amazing transformation!! You look so good already, and way happier! Super happy for you girl!
gained it in all the right placea
""even if I did gain 30lbs""  
IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES, Those are killer hips.
i don’t know you, but i can confidently dm say your personality is almost exactly the same as pre-hrt based solely on the way you dress. /hj
i think there is magic in every pound you gained your hips are looking beautiful im so jealous!!!🥰😻
how so you grow your hair so quickly o.o
edit, nvm did read the comments
You're lucky you started out looking quite feminine
Damn you look good girl 🥺👏
I think you look amazing.
im in love with the fit and the attitude 😌👌🏽
I gained exactly thirty pounds, all face, chest, and butt.
I envy ur hair omg

Mines just a curly ball of hair atm and I’m meeting with a hair dresser this Saturday to try to help it

Either way tho you look amazing!!
wow.
You have consumed the gender fluid
You look beautiful!
If you gained, it's in all the right places. You look great and super natural.
Holy fuck you’re pretty
Weight gain looks great girl!
Gained in all the right places.
Beautiful
Looks like you gained the weight in all the right places! Your hair growth is amazing too for that short a time! Estrogen is a miracle! God Bless you Girl! ❤️🙏
gotta be like 15lbs of muscle too right
Beautiful
You look great! I hope you are feeling great
yeah.... it hit you like a freight train and in a good way.. I am so jealous.. I haven't a clue were to even start the process or who to ask,, but I hope estrogen does me as good as it did you.. squeeeee!!!!!!
Damn you slay i wish i would pass that well. Just wait until the rest of the changes hits later on

You look amazing!
You look amazing!!!
Damn that's a good transformation!! I need some E now xD
You look really good. How are you taking your estrogen and is that all you are taking?
Where’d you get those pants o.o
I need dat magik, betch!! 😮‍💨
squidward voice oh no she's thick
I want those hips, I’m not a chest person but Hrt had been really aggressive on my chest.
You are a goddess🥰
Quite a change in only 4 months. Probably because you got started early. Well, maybe not early, but while still young lol.
Honestly, the amount my mental health got so much better after I started hormones and how fast I felt my body changing was amazing
I love hrt
How did you go from one side of the lesbian fashion spectrum to the other?
Fake or not, looks super dapper :)
Bruh my English teacher had that exact same outfit
It look awesome tho, you rock!
That makes sense! Lol 😂 It looks great on you though!
I was about to ask your hair growth secret 😭
same! I was hoping e would fix that I've always been stick thin and I might actually gain some weight but 8mo in and no such luck :(
I have been losing weight on estrogen too. It turns out when you hate yourself and eat your feelings, you tend to gain and keep a lot of weight. With your brain chemistry is fixed, that stops some, and I lose weight.
I lost 5 in the 3 months lol

Granted I had gained a lot of weight due to covid so it’s only repairing dmg
Depends on the state and whether or not you have insurance willing to cover it.
i believe the general suggestion is: if you wanna help your body redistribute fat on hrt, it helps to lose the weight before, and start to regain it after (~3 months after or so, but it's different for everyone). It is *significantly* easier for a person to lose weight when they still have testosterone in the body.
I’m 20, although I get told I look younger a lot
No u
Criminally underrated comment
I feel you. Being type 1 diabetic and avoiding carbs doesn't help me. 

But I'm happy with the way I look. I hope you love yourself as well anyway. :)
I think it varies from person to person but all of us want what we don't have
In my case i’m still on my weight or gaining a little bit of weight, when I hated myself for how my body looked, I had trend to do not eat… because I was really scared of gaining weight and look more like a dude… even now I’m still carrying some eating disorders of that time…
TY for the edit.
The latter is of greater concern and the overwhelming odds are in favor of ""no"", sadly.
California?
Im type 1 as well and they wont even put me on hormones 😩
California is very good for trans people luckily. You should be able to get it covered with your insurance.
I used plume after meeting too many docs who didn't want to open that can of worms...in a state where there aren't many choices to begin with. 

Never looked back. 

I hope you find a solution.
Cool beans
See, im scared of doing that cuz my trans doctor said she almost died from self medicating hrt and then also cuz my diabetes doctor says my kidneys will explode if i take hrt as i am now- 👁👄👁 (not to mention its all free for me if i wait till my doctor says its ok so 🤷🏼‍♀️)
damn. it sucks Plume can't do T in some places they can do E due to legislation. doesn't affect me either way as I'm in the UK and not looking for HRT but it's sad that (I assume) sport doping concerns are preventing people getting the meds they need.
That is some exaggerating. I'm sorry your doc tries to scare you. Plume has been very professional with me and spironolactone can cause kidney issues, but they watch that carefully, knowing I'm diabetic. 

If you trust your doc then waiting can be good. Plume is just an extra bill on top of my already steep insurance costs.
To be fair the explosion of kidneys is an exaggeration but she does tell me that ill end up on dialysis sooner than most if i start hrt now :/
Sounds like you already have some kidney issue
 That is tough. I'm sorry to hear! I hope things start to work out for you!!!
Im sure they will :3"	twjnkx	trans	3014	0.95	2022-04-05 01:50:19
The attitude toward trans men vs trans women is insane	"TW: hateful speech about trans women. 

I came out as trans (ftm) to one of my coworkers (F55) and she’s been 100% supportive. So far she’s been asking a lot of questions regarding how the hormones work, the different kinds of surgeries available to trans men, what the timeline of transitioning looks like, ect. 

There hasn’t been a single time where I felt she was over stepping any boundaries or say anything intentionally harmful. She’s made her intentions clear that she means absolutely no harm in the questions she is asking, she’s just never met a trans man before, hasn’t been exposed to that side of the LGBT community as much. As such, I’m more than happy to answer her questions based on my personal experiences.

However, because I am FTM, nearly every conversation we’ve had regarding trans people has been about trans men. Until today when she told me about a trans women that she had encountered in a public restroom.

From what I understood this woman was extremely early on in her trans and didn’t pass very well. I did my best to explain the differences between testosterone and estrogen, and how it can take longer for trans women especially after puberty to see the effects of HRT.

The conversation then took a turn about Dylan Mulvaney. My coworker said that she dislikes Dylan being the face of different beauty campaigns and compared her to a predator. She said that publicizing trans women puts “real” women down. In the same breath she said all trans women are “pretty much men anyways and I’ll never trust them”. More was said but I’d rather not type it down. 

Needless to say I was completely shocked. A few days ago this same coworker was hyping me up and exclaiming how excited she was to see how I look in a year (I’ve recently started T). She offered me a hand and said if I ever needed help regarding my transition she’d do anything to help. But when discussing trans women she had a complete distaste for them and was just hateful. 

After reflecting on this I realized that this unfortunately isn’t entirely uncommon. 

To my trans sisters, you don’t have anything to prove. Stay safe and I love all of you."	"Yeah, bro, I'd be questioning the validity of her ""support"" if I were you. I've run into this with TERF-y types before too; they'll appear supportive because they think of you as a fellow gal pal who is just playing pretend and don't actually consider you to be a man, so you're therefore not perceived as a threat to them. On the flipside, they see trans women as men who are trying to co-opt womanhood and therefore as a threat. They're not *actually* supportive of any trans people, they're just shitty bigots.
In other words, she probably doesn't see you as a man either...

Thanks, bro.
Unfortunately this sounds suspiciously like she still sees you as a fellow woman, and thus is being supportive, whereas she sees trans women as men and thus feels they are invading her spaces.
Oh yah, don’t worry you’ll be seeing transphobia from her once you start passing more, or whenever you show the mildest sign of disappointment or irritation. Then you’ll suddenly be a “roid raging mysoginistic man-thing” whose being “poisoned” by EVIL Testosterone, and just as predatory as the trans-woman in her eyes. Right now, in her eyes she either considers you a woman or a “UwU femme soft-boi who needs help because he is very smol”, so not a threat and not a nasty predatory man. Her support is entirely contingent on how you look and how much ass patting and “good person” points you give her. 

Edit: To clarify, trans men and trans women will see the same levels of persecution in different ways. In regards to being seen as “predatory” trans men go through stages: 
You are a child-like victim who thinks being a man will save them from Patriarchy and can’t make your own decisions > you are an in-between femme man-thing who is non-threatening, but is slowly being “poisoned” and made ugly and mysoginistic by evil T. You need to be told constantly you are turning into a monster, all past and current experiences of discrimination do not matter and you must never speak of them > You are now considered a man and are a predatory enemy. You transitioned purely to hurt all women, you are now a tool of the patriarchy and are the reason cis women have to say “birthing person”. You are nothing more than a grooming r*pist who deserves death and persecution. 

All of this rhetoric is rooted in the idea that hormones are what determine a good vs bad person, a predator vs a protector. The evil is in the T and any proximity to it is evil.
Yeah I recently have had coworkers be fine with certain aspects of LGBT+ and then horrible about others.

When they found out I identified as a gay male they were 100% fine with that. But because trans people has been a hot topic online for conservatives lately they’ve been talking about it and they have been saying transphobic things. 

And here’s me at least accepting that im trans to myself finally but I could never be out honest about it at work without changing jobs 🙃

It’s disappointing but at least you found out what kind of person your coworker is and you should understand that you don’t need someone like that in your life.
You do understand though that the fact that she's got that attitude towards trans women but is all girlfriends with you means that she still completely sees you as a woman?
Sounds like a slimy terf to me.
This co-worker is a despicable bigot.

She doesn't see you as a man. She feels comfortable saying these things to you because she still sees you as a woman.

Gross.
Be careful around that overinvolved woman.   
She‘s probably going to snap when you start to pass, or hang around more men.  
Bet she doesn‘t consider you a man at all.
I'm so sorry babe, but she sees you as a woman, not the awesome man that you are, dude.

Best wishes from a trans sister. <3
Yeah it’s a thing. It’s not really “trans men” or “trans women” as much as it’s cultural attitudes on men vs women in general. It’s misogyny. Even when trans men don’t pass early on in their transition, it doesn’t really matter, because society has firmly gotten used to masculine women and tomboys, that there isn’t the same painful period for trans men. Trans women can go for years through an emotionally devastating beginning, where there are definite times when you can be seen as a joke, some hideous thing, because that’s been the culturally ingrained view of “men dressed as women”. It was fodder for decades and centuries of jokes. And there’s also the notion that “women = inherently sexual”, and that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. It’s complicated.
Yeah ~~internalized misogyny~~ sexism is the core of all the problems trans women are facing and this comes from women just as much as men.

It also probably means she doesn't fully see you as man either or she'd be just as hostile towards you, even if she doesn't recognize it herself.
i think trans women are just more victim of public transphobia campaigns. The right wing keeps shouting themselves half horse spreading misinformation about them, so a lot of people who may not be inherently transphobic pick up on the misinformation and start getting wrong biases. whereas for trans men, as you said the public eye isn't on them nearly as much, so the first thing people express is usually curiosity and ignorance and not bigotry
I’ve noticed that as well.

It sometimes feels like transphobes either don’t realise, or have forgotten, that trans men exist. Especially with things like trans bathroom bans.

And when they do, they try to separate them from trans women in discussion, almost like, for want of better metaphor, they’re a model minority. I say this because, in terf’s eyes at least, trans masc aren’t as “pushy”* as trans femme.

*they say pushy, intelligent people say just asking for respect, the right to exist, and to be safe, while living their authentic selves.
that's basically because she sees you as a semi-woman while she sees trans women as men. People with this type of behaviour act and seem supportitive towards afab trans people because they view them as Woman Lite rather than whatever they actually are. 

They talk and behave like they think you're a guy, but they don't view you as one- at least as long as you look non-threatening (and are pretty). If you're a huge bear who's not pretty or handsome, and often just very fat that support tends to fly out of the window. 

This set of beliefs is also a byproduct of TERF rhetoric being disembodied from the context of TERFs by being amputated and sutured into other discourse and ideology. They acknowledge that trans people deserve to live but they don't actually see them as who they are, whether consciously or subconsciously, because they've internalised to themselves that a man is always a predator who steals from women, and a women is always a victim who is stolen from by men.

they live in an alternate social gender binary that defines man and women by the social positions of predator and prey.

they're friendly with people who they view as woman lite because of this, and if you pass too good or are ugly as a trans man you're expected to constantly apologise for existing and being a man because according to them that's enough to be harmful and evil, while trans women need to be white, skinny and very pretty to receive any kind of validity, otherwise they're seen as Men In Dresses who secretly deep down have the biological urge to prey on women (that somehow vanishes the second they're hot enough). 

it's utter fucking shit and it's just one of the ways TERFs and TERF beliefs have prominently poisoned people's minds over the years indirectly via other queer discourse
I think she still sees you as a woman 😔
Maybe confront her about it?
Terfs be wilding again
your co-worker still sees you as a woman, honestly, and she is full of hatred towards any 'men' (which in her book includes trans women)

trans men don't have it easier, they just have different struggles. we all have a difficult road to travel.
I just threw up in my mouth a little. This is the kind of shit that made me go back in my shell and detransition 30 years ago and I'm not putting up with it any longer. I almost killed myself slowly and I lived in hell. Everyday I prayed for death i barely took care of myself. 

I found a piece of clothing from my transition days. A very worn out but still cute and laundry day usable pair of panties. I put them on and it all came back. The gender euphoria/dysphoria the realization that I was living a lie that was killing me and I had to free myself once again. The egg was cracking again and I kicked it open because my life depended on it. That was 4 years ago. Now I'm 60 and lost 140 lbs got healthy and I've been on hormones for a bit over 6 months, again. So I log 3 puberties now. Not doing this again, this time it's forever.

So for all those trefs out there that say I'm not a ""real"" woman, I say you don't know what it takes to be a ""real"" woman and that is the saddest thing in the world. To all my Sisters out there that know the ""real"" truth, Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. We are more the same than we are different. Not some nice platitude, that's science.

God bless each and everyone of us. We are butterflies that won't be kept a caterpillar. Crack open that shell spread your wings and fly.

Rant over. Love to you all. Also, Trans men are MEN. We are all in on this together boys, thanks for the support.
I definitely think that’s a TERF. I think she thought of you as “yasss queen break the gender roles and act masculine!” and thinks of trans women as “men want women’s struggles smh”
Your co-worker is a TERF, it sounds like. She may not even see you as a man.
TERF alert.
She’s not your ally despite what she claims.
I’m a trans man myself and I’ve had a co worker who was openly transphobic to trans women and non binary people but for some reason I was an ‘exception'. It didn’t take me long to realise that her bigoted views didn’t exclude anyone. Terfs are everywhere dude. I’m sorry you had to experience that.
I worked in a restaurant with people just like this. It was incredibly toxic and the “support” was insincere. All the FTMs who worked there had their identities acknowledged, but when it came to being the only trans woman, I was treated like the plague and denied my pronouns/identity. 

So glad I left.
Asking questions about surgeries and hormones is crossing boundaries.  It is not normal to go around asking people about their genitals/surgeries.  All too often, when trans people come out, the genital survey begins.  

In this world we live in, why don't people just google it if they need to know so bad?  Why do they need to know in the first place?
Unfortunately Transphobia is deeply rooted in sexist ideologies like how they view men as predators and women as passive. Hence why they see trans women as predators trying to invade and dominate womens spaces (which is absolutely ridiculous) whilst seeing trans men as confused butches.
Honestly, I would cut communication with her if you can. She probably will use the fact that “I’m friends with a trans person.” to continue being transphobic if you don’t. So sorry. :(
Transphobes in so deep they don’t even realise when they bingo themselves.
Reminds me of that shitty JK Rowling quote (paraphrasing here) ""Ironically, TERFS aren't exclusionary as they include trans men in their feminism"". A lot of the support I've seen for trans men seems to come from others that still fundamentally view they as women.

I'm kinda lucky as I'm two years into mtf transition, but live somewhere progressive enough and am enough of a homebody that I've not run into anything too bad 😅 But it's definitely held true in my experience that afab trans people are often infantilized, while amab trans people are usually portrayed as a predator/deviant :/
Questions of her *actual* support aside.  If it makes you feel any better, it's actually pretty common for us, too.  Not the inverse.  But like, people who hate trans women like to make ""exceptions"" for me.

The amount of hate that has been shoveled into their ideology honestly just falls apart and isn't sustainable when it's challenged by actually knowing someone.  They'll treat you like you're special or different.  Somehow, the one normal or deserving queer.  And if that doesn't work, then maybe they'll think you're not queer at all.  That you've been tricked or groomed or misled.  Anything to distance you from the community that they hate so much that it doesn't even hold up to what they can believe about a person in their life.

It's their black friend who ""just seems like a normal dude.  Not like those other thugs. ""  Their queer friend who ""doesn't make it their whole personality, though.""  Their girl friend who's just ""one of the guys.""

When their beliefs and stereotypes about groups of people are challenged by meeting them and seeing that it's not actually accurate, they can either reshape their beliefs or they can view the challenger as though they aren't a typical example.  Most people I know chose the 2nd option.
If her argument for not trusting trans women is because they’re “practically still men” then shouldn’t she also be cautious about trans men? It’s hypocritical.
The fact she implied trans women aren’t “real” women says to me that she really doesn’t see you as a man either and is trying to keep the civility. It reminds me of a racist person smiling and being friendly with a person of the race they hate. The hate is there, just under a friendly looking blanket.
Doesn't this put her under the classification of TERF?

Also, I don't mind doing some proving. I want the people actively doubting me to choke, and I'd love to do the choking myself.
I literally just posted on another trans sub about how a few of my friends who fully support me were being transphobic about trans women!! Like wtf man how can you not see how shitty and hypocritical that is! I feel like damn do they think this stuff about me? I tried to let them know thats not okay but I feel like they kinda brushed me off. I hate that trans women get so much hate while trans men are either ignored or lifted up. I wish there wasn’t such a fight for validation or even common decency for our ladies:(
Run.
Thank for sharing, and yeah it is just the world we live in. I hope your friendship with this oersons helps them to one day be less of a terrible person. 

The kind message at the end is appreciated, and frankly this story is the reason I'm.so uncomfortable in all toilets I use. I try to avoid the need to pee when I'm out these days cause of it.
Transmisogyny :(
hr asap
the amount of times i’ve come out as ftm to people and they were chill with it but then they share their nasty opinions about trans women near me…. like atp their support means nothing to me
w t f
I'd be taking her interest in hormones and procedures as a red flag out the gate if I'm honest. I personally find those questions invasive.
I think a big part of this is that right-wing hate mongering almost exclusively focuses on transwomen.  ""Transwomen are just men trying to invade women's spaces for predatory puproses,"" basically.   Whereas transmen are painted as victims, we should feel bad for and take up a lot less of the discourse.

This has always bothered me on a different level, beyond the basic hate.  It's the underlying assumption of gender discrimination.   Transwomen are given the same amount of fear and consideration they give to male minorities, and transmen are treated like helpless women and as victims.
As others have mentioned, I don't think your co-worker is being selectively transphobic to trans women only because she does not seem to take your manhood seriously. Although it may seem like she is more okay with trans men than with trans women because she may be nice to you on a superficial level while saying mean things about trans women, it seems like she doesn't take your trans identity seriously and is being transphobic to you as well.

Think about it- if this person knows you are trans, then it should be obvious to her that any general statement that is negative to trans people will hurt your feelings and be obviously offensive to you. The fact she has absolutely no hesistation to say such blatantly transphobic things right in front of you shows that she doesn't really see you as a man or even as a trans person overall. It's likely that in her eyes, you are just a quirky kind of woman, and it seems like she is expecting you to be able to relate with her complaints about how trans women are negatively affecting ""real"" women, because she sees you as being one of those ""real"" women who is being negatively affected by trans women.

I'm not saying this to deny that the fact that misogyny and hatred of women and of the feminine does contribute to trans women generally being more marginalized in society due to the intersection of transphobia and misogyny, but I also want to point out that in this specific situation, your coworker is not being just selectively transphobic to trans women, and is transphobic to trans men as well due to how she treats you.

I appreciate your show of allyship to trans women by pointing out how transmisogyny is playing a role in her behaviour, but I also don't want that to overshadow the awareness of the fact that you are a victim of transphobic behaviour from her as well, and that your own needs are something to consider and prioritize in this situation.
I wish more trans men would acknowledge this terrible double standard and speak against it. I appreciate you doing so. We all face transphobia, and neither is necessarily ""worse"" than the other, but trans women face transphobia rooted in fear, hatred, and disgust, whereas trans men face transphobia rooted in infantilization and contempt.
Yup.  Read any of the most influential/ culturally prominent transphobes -Ray Blanchard, JK Rowling, or just any average TERF -  their focus is 100% on trans women, almost as if trans men didn't exist to them.  It's hard to know exactly why this is the case, some say Blanchard has a fetish for trans women, and he was so bothered that some trans women were lesbians and wouldn't sleep with him, it inspired his ""typology"".  As for Rowling - some say it's because she was traumatized by men years ago and this is the toxic way she processed it.

I'll bring up cis people, it's in the same realm as, women can wear ""mens"" clothing and no one cares -  no one think tomboys are creepy or predatory. But a cis man wearing a skirt is seen as a deviant. It all stems from those same fears.
Transmisogyny is a bitch.
I feel like people are more suspicious about mtf than ftm, because it's taboo for ""a man to become a woman"", while it's kinda okay for a woman to ""become a man"". And because they think of trans women as men, they see them as predators, because you know, men are bad.  A kind of ""wolf in a sheep's clothing"" kind of thing. Also in my experience people are less aware of trans men, while everyone know that trans women exist, so they focus on them more.
The attitude towards men Vs wome is insane.

Men get called pedophiles for taking their children to the playground, trans women get called sexual predators for going to the toilet.

It's the same narrative (we saw it previously with gay men aswell).
From men it's misogyny (they don't want to fuck men)

From women its misandry (men are dangerous)

FTM doesn't matter because ""i wouldn't fuck them anyway"" and it's a woman doing what she wants.
There is a very good she is a terf and believes you're just a confused butch, they are known to do that
Not only is she seeing trans women as men, but her friendliness indicates that she sees you as ""one of the girls"".
You deserve better.
The level of entitlement some cis women have over trans women is unreal.
Sadly, she doesn't really support your transition either, she still sees you as a woman, one who is in need of the ""sisterhood"" to help her out.  

This generalization that ""anyone who's ever had a penis is either a pedophile or a predator"" is just the fucking worst.
Trans women are women. I haven’t met anyone in the bathroom who didn’t ’pass’, but if I did, I wouldn’t raise a stink about it. Goodness. Some people just can’t mind their own business.
My expirience with a lot of cis women is that they're super supportive of me being a woman with a beard or some kind of political statement that women can be masculine too. When I start talking about transitioning and shit they make a 180 and see it as me being a little gay boy with mommy issues trying to appropriate womanhood. Now that I pass they're all just super confused lol

She probably sees it as the opposite for you. You're proof that women can be just as strong and masculine as men, not just a regular old dude dude-ing his way around through life.
i saw the warning and read this anyways [https://tenor.com/6Tar.gif](https://tenor.com/6Tar.gif)
Did you confront her on that topic, or keeping in mind how helpful she may be to you in future, you stood silent?
Absolutely disgusted.
Like how can someone support trans men but not women and vice versa?

It sounds like she has some internalized hate towards men and I’ve noticed often those that have that hate can’t/refuse to see trans women as women

And those who have sexist/misogynistic views of women can’t/refuse to see trans men as men

That’s just my observations
The way I see it, society still sees men as better than women.
So people will see a transman as someone ""upgrading""
to get a better life.
Theyll view a transwoman as someone downgrading, and thinking the only reason theyd do that must be predatory.
I wonder if trans men are regarded as “safe men” and trans women as “unsafe men “ by these people

I am very curious but not surprised
A lot of people are calling into question coworkers true support of OP, but I wouldn't be surprised if this person actually does support trans men.  I think this person has the potentially be an ally for all trans people, and OP is doing a lot of good by trying to explain things to them. I think their problem comes from the patriarchy.

In a patriarchal society, an AFAB that takes on masculine qualities, or transitions to male, could be seen as pursuing power and privilege.  This makes sense to a lot of cis people, power is good, men have power. But when an AMAB takes on female qualities or transitions, cis people see that as relinquishing power and privilege. This isn't true, of course, but it confuses people, so they assume and project ulterior motives of deceit or perversion.
It’s always problems with trans woman haha. Sports, bathrooms, etc. if only trans men existed there would be no trans debate lol
Combination of two societal traits unfortunately. 

First, bith gender and socialization trump identity for many cis individuals. More shared experiences at early ages make you relatable. Where the opposite is scary.  
 
Second, is misogyny.  It's ok to be masculine but not feminine. It's ok for ""girls"" to be boyish. But a boy being feminine is wrong.
shit. I don’t even know what to say now. I just hope if I do transition society wont be fucking delusional
Good luck dude.
Sigh, they sure sound supportive on paper dont they?
Yeah I'd stay away from her dude. Her transphobia is nasty and she probably doesn't see you as a man at all.
From a trans sister to a trans brother :❤️
dont be fooled by ppl like this, i guarantee she’s said mad shit behind ur back. i mean fuck dylan mulvaney but fuck this person more
My partner has explained this to me a couple of times and I think it has merit. Unfortunately, cishet women, no matter their preference in partners will see transmen as “wayward sisters” that have just strayed from the lesbian identity. I think there is some merit, but I think that there is always a double standard for trans women compared to transmen. Transmen face their own struggle, completely, but I think it’s that society has become more comfortable with women or girls wanting to have experiences as men in the same vein as tomboy has become a term that does not really question someone’s “straightness” while the most comparable for boys that identify with their femininity, femboys, are seen as either say gay, queer, or even trans. So the attitude shifts when looking at how someone presents based on where they start and whether they pass. This is not true this is just an observation that could be completely wrong. Either way that woman isn’t really an ally, and has internalized patriarchy that is harmful to trans folk imo
I don't mean to be mean but: You realize that only now?
The fact that she said she could 'never trust any men,' is more telling than anything else for me......

That is an VERY EXTREME position to take on half the world's population.
People being so concerned about trans people in the bathroom is crazy but it has an underlying issue to it. When discussing this with my Intro to Queer Activism Professor she brought up how women, her included, are and have been taught to fear being raped by a man and to be on guard for it. Not that this is necessarily a problem in of itself however it is teaching women that they need to be afraid of men which is not good. There are gender-neutral bathrooms around my campus and I've had conversations with people about them. One person who was a woman mentioned how she was uncomfortable with a man working after her. Nothing happened other than that person existing. When people are taught to be afraid it hurts everyone. We need to teach about rape and what consent is. We need to teach how to be away and not have to be afraid. It is not a problem to feel uncomfortable with a man being in the bathroom but you should do something about that personally like use an individual room. It really sucks how fear is implanted in society and how that is taken out on marginalized groups.
Just a reminder that using “early on in transition” for someone whom you have no idea about their transition path is pretty transphobic. Especially if it’s coming from a cis person. It implies that there is a right way to transition and in such someone else can tell a stranger’s position in their journey. 

If you rephrase it to what they actually mean, it’s usually that they don’t “look enough” like the gender they are perceived to be presenting as. Keep this in mind please. It can be really hurtful.

Thanks for the insights sir. As most trans women know, it's all about passing. This whole trans. Women and bathrooms issue is so goddamn childish it's amazing. Does she think that a trans woman hopped up on estrogen and Spiro is going to be a threat of rape to her?
[removed]
I just want to send hugs as already many comments already punch the terfism of your coworker. Sending hugs and strength to you and everybody who needs it.
Most of the hate for trans women starts with the assumption that they are always men and that all men are dangerous sexual predator, that that’s normal and that it’s acceptable. Right wingers have no issues with men being rapists.
Someone’s JELLO
She probably doesn't even view you as a boy. She sounds sus
I think one of the hardest parts about being a transwoman is simply how much more attention we get, and to an extent, I'm a little jealous of how transmen don't get the same attention. although it also makes me very glad y'all don't have to go through the same kind of struggle. Either way, I appreciate your kind words. 🫶
The transmisogyny seems to be always lurking just under the surface for many cis ""allies"". Sadly.
Don't worry we are used to with it like world is sadly discourages us that's why most of transfem don't even talk in public
That's really sad. I'm sorry to hear this. She's clearly been influenced by transphobic lies on the Internet. If you care for this coworker and are willing to put in the work, they may be a chance that you can teach her - she's within your circle of influence. One key thing that I've found with most people is that they don't understand the difference between gender and sex. Its so crucial to understand this. Not understanding this is the root of transphobia.

I did a talk at my workplace recently about this, and I think people found it really informative. I'll give you the link to the slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D5X8KOkolX1y_mgp4jGpe0DIFqyD38C-uJb2AJIULSo/edit?usp=drivesdk

Its actually a really long talk -- it's worth going through the beginning bit really slowly (so they can understand the difference between gender and sex). I've had to split it into two talks at my workplace. I've done part 1 already and will do part 2 soon! You're welcome to use them.
I don’t like Dylan either and I’m a trans woman. But that lady sounds very TERF-y.
this is sadly extremely common, like stupid common im not even kidding
Agree with a lot of the responses about how she likely sees you still as a woman. I’d note that, within the framework of patriarchy, people tend to infantilize women and afab people and disregard them. You are likely not viewed as a threat so she feels she can be supportive. On the flip side, trans women are viewed as men invading women’s spaces. Because women are infantilized they need protection; men don’t. Additionally, I think a lot of the disparate treatment of trans masculine and trans feminine people comes from the fact that, within the framework of patriarchy, transitioning from female to male makes sense to people. It is perceived as involving capturing more power and privilege. Transitioning from male to female doesn’t make sense to people and is seen as an abomination because it involves giving up power and privilege. This is viewed as an abomination because it more directly contradicts the power structure of patriarchy.
I would be cautious around her because she might be one of those terfs that think they're 'rescuing' you from being trans, she might just be supportive because she wants you to trust her. That being said, the point of this post is still true. Transmisogyny/transphobia aimed at transfems is fucking rampant, I even see alot of transmascs participating in that shit
As a trans woman, I often find myself having to keep my lips sealed tight. Bc if I don’t I’ll have already gone off on so many people without even realizing it.

I always try to be respectful towards everyone but when they’re so bigoted like this… OOOH I WANNA LOSE IT!
I'm curious how do people think us going on hormones is pretending? Why would they be supportive if they think we are cis? I'm genuinely asking because I also have had this happen
>I've run into this with TERF-y types before too; they'll appear supportive because they think of you as a fellow gal pal who is just playing pretend and don't actually consider you to be a man, so you're therefore not perceived as a threat to them.

See also how many stories there are of trans men with initially supportive female friends who suddenly drop off once they start to pass.
yep! i second this. its very common trope on the TERF forms to think of trans masc people as lost-women that are victims of the woke mind virus and that trans femmes are the 'bad' ones.

trans masc people are generally celebrated as long as they look androgynous but as soon as they start to pass these TERFs will drop them hard
This. Unfortunately anything OP felt as ""genuine support"" should be questioned at this point. The biggest tell is that she doesn't appear to trust men. That means that OP's gender is likely not actually being validated. She would be untrusting of OP too, but from the sounds of it, sees him as a ""gal pal"" as you put it.
I never trust CIS women
completely unrelated but i can't help myself i just wanted to say i love your user flair sm 

*what do you mean, normal men?*
If she saw o.p. as even ""pretty much a man anyways,"" she obviously wouldn't trust him... in her own words, at least
Came to the comments to say the same exact thing.
Take my 👻🏅! 💐🦈
[removed]
Fr...
Bingo. I'd have told the coworker to fuck off and never talked to her again if she was talking that way about any variation of trans people like that to my face. These unevolved idiots need to be shamed.
As a Transfem that is kinda new to this whole TERF debate (aka only knows about it because of a certain author), doesn't the argument that T is the evil by extension mean that all cis men are evil?

Edit: spelling
couldn't have said it better
I am a cis male (53), my son (17) is trans. Between age and antidepressants, I don’t struggle with this much anymore, but I remember being young all too well. He hasn’t started transitioning yet, really, but I have offered him this warning:

Testosterone is a powerful drug. It can make you want to eat, fight, or fuck *everything.* It is your responsibility and duty to be strong in the face of that, to peer through clouded judgment and ensure that you are treating everyone with respect *at all times, no matter what, no excuses.*

For me, it’s just been the last four years or so that I’ve felt myself relieved of these effects. (Yes, there are also downsides to that, which is how I can be fairly certain it’s lower influence of testosterone.) I can’t express to you how much easier it is to be a *person* now.

I know everyone’s experiences are different, but this is mine. My observations of other men’s behaviors seem to indicate that plenty of people have a similar (or more challenging) experience.
The ""women= inherently sexual"" thing is huge. And it also affects trans women themselves. How many times do you see a trans woman's outfit posted here that is skimpy/revealing? I see it way too much. Hand in hand goes the imposter syndrome of ""maybe it's just a fetish and I'm making an excuse.""

That's completely ignoring the societal perception that leads to the BS predator stuff.
I actually think it's the opposite tbh. I think people see MEN as sexual and sexual predators in general because they have a high sex drive and women do not. Thus, they view a man doing something like turning into a woman as something sexual because men will do things all the time just to get laid. It's a sad thing men deal with because they can be accused of doing things for sexual or flirtatious reasons when that isn't the case. But a woman transitioning to a man isn't inherently sexual or dangerous because it's a woman doing it and they aren't seen as sexual predators.
A woman hating on people she perceives as men would be misandry, not misogyny
A woman hating on people she perceives as men would be misandry, not misogyny
she knows what she’s doing. don’t make her comfortable talking ab that shit in front of you. she can gtfo
> an AFAB that takes on masculine qualities, or transitions to male, could be seen as pursuing power and privilege.

This is the delineation. An AFAB. all OP will ever be in this person's eyes is a defiant, go-getter female. No matter how much she says she respects OP, he will always be a man* in her eyes until she addresses the latent Transphobia.
Why fuck Dylan? 

I'm not exactly a fan of her myself 'cause I find her personality a little overly-bubbly and grating but I haven't seen anything she's actually done wrong, has she fucked up somewhere?
Wait I'm out of the loop, why do trans people dislike dylan?
I mean if you’ve detransitioned and you’re not a man it would be pretty hard to see yourself as one.
Anyone can be a threat of rape. However that doesn’t mean a trans woman, passing or not, is more dangerous than anyone else.
[removed]
Because TERF-types think trans men have been duped by the patriarchy, and once they realize it they will de-transition.
Most cis people have no idea how many effects those hormones have. They have no idea that they can totally change what someone looks like, and they often think that physical changes are the result of surgery or something.
I think it has more to do with TERFs and such tend to crave the same power dynamics of the patriarchy and thus see trans men (but still seen as women) as invading men’s spaces appropriately. In a way to enhance and further women’s power subversively. It’s why so many are aligned with the conservative right wing in many ways as it is the current resistance to the further “eroding” of male power in society. These women and allies want that power for themselves, not feminine power or authority but women claimed male authority. It’s beyond stupid, the last thing the world needs is MORE patriarchy, especially from women. The contradiction and hatred of TERFs is astounding as it does not further women’s rights at all. Really at the end TERFs and TERF like people tend to not make a great deal of logical sense as their entire premise is based on emotion and the exchange of that rather than logical or well thought out reasoning.
> I'm curious how do people think us going on hormones is pretending? Why would they be supportive if they think we are cis? I'm genuinely asking because I also have had this happen


I think it's just because they don't really think you're ""pretending"" or that you're cis, they just categorize people by their sex more than by their identity. 
Like, many people here are saying that it means these people don't ""really"" support the people the people they appear to be supporting, but I honestly think that's a big stretch. 
Someone can think a trans woman is a type of a man and still support them transitioning simply because it's what they want to do and doesn't hurt anyone, so why not support them? 

Many people use different classifications than most trans people would prefer, and man/woman is still most commonly a reference to someones sex over most if not all of the world, and this idea that this is inherently hateful towards trans people just seems silly.
It's just like putting on clothes, body modification. It doesn't change who you really are, your spirit, your self is still the same.
Yeah I sadly lost a lot of closeness with some of my friends who are cis women the more I started to pass, and I have a horrible feeling it's because they were hoping I'd ""pass"" in the sort of softboi anime twink kind of way and failed to recongise that I am over six feet tall, have always had the shoulders of a linebacker and that, if his appearance is anything to go by, my father might not actually be a Norwegian man but actually a sort of bipedal Norwegian man-bear hybrid. 

Like there's nothing wrong with being a twinkier trans dude, I was just never, ever gonna be and I feel like some of the cis women I was friends with - even the ones who were queer in some way themselves - were weirdly disappointed by it.
This is transmisogyny not feminism
Ban evasion accounts be like:
I think you meant TERF not just feminist
Coworker is a FART. Feminism-appropriating radical transphobe. ""TERF"" would imply she's actually a feminist.

Edit: I have been informed that ""FART"" is cringe. Please accept as an alternative, ""FIB,"" for feminist-identifying bigot.
Look up the definition of feminist. Plz.
I'd assume so. Most of the women who do ascribe to TERF ideology tend to be the ones who believe all men are evil predatory beings.
Radical feminism has always been more about being anti-men than being pro-women. If you’re transitioning FTM you’re joining the ranks of the enemy. If you’re transitioning MTF you’re an invader. You’ll never win with that crowd.
Yeah, and that's why they try to say their feminists. It's all about ""protecting"" cis women from men of any kind. It's stupid, but unfortunately here we are.
Yes TERFs/Radfems are extremely misandristic.
They hate men/males in all shapes and forms, they hate Trans women only because they are assigned MALE at birth.
Yes. The thing about Terfs is that it’s much more about hating men and reinforcing their version of the gender binary (the white female one) than it is about actual equality. They ignore any and all marginalized men and genders, and are focused on preserving white female victimhood rather than egalitarianism. Anyone who falls into the proximity of masculinity is undesirable (this includes black cis women and trans women of color, in particular) and an enemy who needs to be snuffed out and kept in line. Terf ideals are very insidious and revolve around a blend of misogyny x misandry and white supremacy (trans-misogyny is a term used to describe this. Contrary to popular belief, trans men experience this as well, but in different ways. But, the root of the discrimination is the same.). it’s easy thought process to fall into, so much so that you’ll probably see it echoed by white trans people and other queer people as well. Part of what makes it so appealing is that it plays off the trauma many people have faced at the hands of cis men, and it provides an outlet for that trauma, fear and aggression while offering an illusion safety beneath oppression.
Medically, what you’re saying is just false. 

A lot of these ideas and why it’s so hard to “person” as a young male are due to socialization and gender essentialism excusing a lot of inexcusable behaviors. 
When I first went on T I believed these myths and thought I’d become aggro, violent and horny, easily irritated etc… Color me surprised when the exact opposite happened. I mellowed considerably and I’ve yet to see any anger or aggression from taking T. Yah, my libido went up and it was tricky to manage finding private time and getting used to the physical feeling, but that’s about it. It didn’t make me some angry predator.

I also verified this with my doctor, who confirmed that what you’re describing, and what is commonly believed about T, is just not true. 

T isn’t any more “powerful” than any other hormone and if you have too much of it, it can even convert to estrogen which actually can cause irritability and trigger mood swings. But too much of anything in your body is a bad idea. We not so sexually dimorphic as a species that T is some wild “drug” and E is not. 

For the sake of trans men, and men in general, we really need to stop forcing these myths onto guys that T is what drives these behaviors, or that T is some major indicator of aggression, because it’s not. The way we teach men how to process their emotions and cope with the world around them is what drives these behaviors, not hormones.

Also, the idea that T is a powerful drug while E is not, is what keeps trans men from life saving healthcare, and it’s also what allows other gender essentialists to paint us as unmanageable predators (and by extension, other marginalized men as well) who need a firm hand. It’s not a cool stereotype, and we need to lean more on medical science than myth.
I've been suffering through that myself. Questioning whether or not its a fetish, I don't believe it is, but my mind simply refuses to stop going back to that possibility of ""what if its a fetish?"". It's been driving me bat-shit crazy.
I agree. Women are seen as being inherently sexual objects, men are seen as predators. That’s what I meant.
I know. I was referring to the idea that women are of lower value, and that “a man dressed as a woman” is lowering themselves
Fair enough, what I actually meant was sexism but I just woke up and picked the wrong word lol
[removed]
one person does not mean all trans ppl lol
Dylan is a bit like sugar-coated trans experience especially her content on tiktok which feels more like targeted to cis people then trasn people, lot of trans people don't like her content because of it (I don't either, but I have no problem with her). However, lately, she got a lot of attention because of all kinds of super privileges, and a lot of people probably either feel jealousy or annoyance that the most famous trans woman is somebody they feel is not good representation of us.

Dylan is the lottery winner of our community she is super lucky, and because of that, she is also really privileged, and people who have already disliked her because of her personality now hate her too.
I meant when I identified as one. Another trans man I know says they don’t really feel like a man so I don’t think it’s an uncommon thing.

Edit: I think I’m referring to trans masc people. Not trans men cause trans men do feel like men.
Exactly. But MtF trans women taking HRT are scientically have lower sex drives than, say, cis males who statitically speaking are far more likely to commit rape. The only people saying that trans people are groomers are liars, QAnon suckers, and social vermin spreading the contagion of hate. Time to sue them.
[removed]
Why encourage the HRT then? Do they hope it will make the person regret it? 

As a side note the pressure of feeling like I was betraying women was very strong and it took me a long time to work past it. I hear that's a common experience
Transitioning is literally fighting against the patriarchy though.
Glad I scrolled before replying. I'd add that they also don't realize:

1. How different trans people are mentally from their AGAB, to begin with.
2. How many mental effects HRT has.
But it is inherently ignorant and bigoted🤷
Oh god, so much this. Cis women love trans men when they are androgynous ‘softboi’ types, but not when they are big hairy bearded dudes. All forms of expression of masculinity are totally valid for trans guys, but cis women definitely tend to fetishise the more feminine forms.
Hey there's a lot of us who like the hairy burly trans men lol. You're valid too.
Can we not with the ""fart""? I get that you don't want to call her a feminist, because she isn't, but fart just sounds like something you'd hear from a six year old on the playground. ""Gender critical transphobe"" works.
> It **can** make you want to eat, fight, or fuck everything.

Can, not will.

> I know everyone’s experiences are different, but this is mine.

You'll also note that I never said anything about estrogen.

You're not wrong about cultural excusing of inexcusable behaviors. This is true far too often. But your assertions that that is the *cause* of those behaviors *in young males* contains the subtext that young males at best have no conscience of their own, and at worst inherently desire to do inexcusable things, apparently purely because of their ""maleness.""

That's an uncool stereotype, too.
I didn't get that impression from OPs description of events. It seems more like their coworker is resentful towards men in general, rather than seeing women as lesser
She has no responsibility for how people see us. She didn’t cause transphobia. She didn’t create it. She isn’t sponsoring it or encouraging it. It’s disgusting to blame trans creators for transphobia. Blame transphobes, not Dylan.
I really dislike her content, but she didn't do anything wrong. She's being constantly harassed by anti trans activists... So why are we getting mad at her instead?? Like, Matt Walsh can come and find a random trans woman being cringey and suddendly she's the asshole? Instead of the transphobic pos whose mocking her?
She’s nice and I support her as a person, but I’d much rather be represented by a trans person who’s actually done something significant (and non-trans-related) with their life, has been trans for long enough to truly understand things (like more than 5 years), and that is strategic politically. 

She’s just a kid and has been trans for not even 2 years. Those attributes are not particularly what I want in someone representing us.
Tbh I’ve seen a lot of trans people who fucking hate Dylan. Specifically r/MTF which is arguably the most insufferable trans subreddit I’ve seen. Lots of… takes…

As for me idfk Dylan and really don’t care to all that much unless there’s a valid reason I should
Yes def. a privilege thing. Most people can access gender affirming care as quickly, or as easily as she has just within the last year in some people’s entire lives! 

I think she has also been accepted in a way that poor, or BIPOC, or non passing, or more fluid in gender expression trans folks typically are. 

She really represents a very niche tiny part of the trans community and I think there maybe is the fear or frustration that cis people are following and watching her as representation for all of us. 

When actually apart from being trans, there is really isn’t a lot in common.
Because I’m assuming you figured out you’re not a man? It’s hard to see yourself as something you’re not
[removed]
Maybe she doesn't believe HRT will cause that many changes.
No it's not. Plain and Simple.
Is it? How and why?
Its akin to them loving having a male best friend thats gay.
More for us
Give me an acronym, not an initialism, and I'll consider changing.
Well, she kinda has responsibility on how people see us.
I completely understand what you’re saying, and I agree that we need more public role models like the ones you’re describing. 

I also want to mention that Dylan did have a successful broadway career before transitioning, which I would definitely consider something significant, if not only in the music and theatre community. I can confirm as another trans vocalist that it’s easy to feel we have to give up on any dreams or careers in musical theatre, opera, or public performance when we transition because very few roles (no roles in older shows) are written for women with a tenor or lower voice. The fact that she is actively working to make a return to the singing and acting community is an important message for trans artists and to cis casting directors, content creators, and audiences. This process is slow for her, and will no doubt be assisted by her privileges and visibility, but is a vital step in helping trans women access the arts as women, not perceived as drag artists, and for all trans and GNC folks. 

I’ll also mention that as a trans woman who started her transition around the same age and time Dylan did, seeing her unabashed pride and joy in who she is and in her womanhood in spite of being early in her transition has been very important for me. I suspect I’m not the only budding trans woman or trans person who feels that way. Trans creators who are deeper in their transition timeline are extremely important also, but for those who are early in our transitions it can feels like we have to wait five or more years to be “real,” “beautiful,” or “valid” like they are. This is a woman who when early in the process of HRT, without bottom surgery, without top surgery, and before FFS said “I am a woman’s exactly as I am, and you can be also.” I would say that in many ways this is equally important to seeing public figures who have been through public transition, HRT, or surgeries for 5 or more years. In that sense the issue becomes not a matter of “either or” and more an issue of “why does society only allow one or two influencers into the public sphere to represent our community?” Perhaps if she was one of many more visible trans people she wouldn’t be so much a topic of debate, and as such I wonder if we could unite on identifying the problem as systemic and social, rather than personal. 

I lastly would like to have some sympathy on the fact that, as far as I can tell from keeping up with her content, she had no intention of becoming as visible as she is, and frequently finds it overwhelming. She has mentioned many times, for example, that she feels someone else, such as a trans woman of colour who has been out as trans for longer, may have been a better fit for interviews, meetings with the president, or activism than she would. One could argue that she should have referred those people instead. But… realistically we know that these public appearances are being requested as a result of her celebrity status and that they wouldn’t necessarily accept a substitute who would gather less visibility. I think she is trying to do the best she can to act responsibly with the opportunities that have been thrown at her, and has been very vocal about requesting that older, more experienced, or less privileged trans people are given the same platform. If I were given the opportunity to help bring visibility to my all-too-often-silenced community I think I would accept that too, and I doubt I’m alone in saying so. I also don’t blame her for taking the opportunity to make a career out of sharing her all-too-often-silenced life and struggles with the world. After all, one’s capacity is limited by their wealth and if she can gain stability by telling her story it will help be able to continue telling it. 

Broadly speaking, and perhaps beyond the context of this comment chain, I want to say she’s taking a lot of bullets for this community. Transphobes are going to fire at whichever of us is in the public eye regardless of how far we are in our transition, and they won’t stop firing until there are so many of us that they can’t keep up anymore and the public finally sees through their baseless hate. She is taking on a responsibility in being visible when it means she will be targeted for it (including media assaults, threats, and doxing) and she is helping to hold the door open for others to become visible too by being who she is in spite of it all. This woman is just trying to live her life in finding trans joy and euphoria and trying to tell other trans people and youth that they can to. I’m sure the last thing she needs, and we need as a community, is to pile onto the assault with friendly fire. I much prefer to choose to appreciate the good she is doing than to join those hateful of our community in criticizing her.
Yeah I agree
What's wrong with that sub?
This. 
  
They overemphasize childhood socialization and underemphasize the effect of hormones. 
  
Which is so backwards because we’ve heard what some men will say when they don’t think any women are around. It scared us. It didn’t give us ideas ffs.
This is what I've noticed whenever a trans related thread makes it to r/all, especially with regards to sports. The vast majority of cis people have ZERO idea of the effect of actual HRT and how impactful hormones actually are. They assume chromosomes are absolute. For example, some people think every trans women need top surgery, they can't process that breasts can grow simply from being on HRT.
Because trans women are women, and trans men are men.

How do you define sex? Chromosomally? Hormonally? Organs at birth?

Most people don't use sex, most people are just ignorant.
I'd previously used ""FIB,"" feminist identified bigot. Just like they call us ""trans identified male"" or TIM, or ""trans identified female"" or TIF. Now I just prefer to use the same language for them that they want, so they can't run away from their beliefs. If they want to be called ""gender critical,"" ok fine. That means gender critical leader Posie Parker wants armed men to go into the women's room to decide who belongs there, and gender critical activist Lily Cade said we should be lynched.
She's a person, it's pretty gross how you're implying that everyone has to be perfect all the time or it's OUR fault that people despise us. How do you think that attitude affects you, in the way you live your life? Aren't you exhausted? Or are you the exception?
No the ABSOLUTE FUCK she doesn’t? That’s like saying Taylor Swift is responsible for how people see women. Or saying Harry Styles is responsible for how people see men. One celebrity from a minority does NOT REPRESENT THE ENTIRE MINORITY. Blame transphobes for transphobia. Blame bigots for bigotry.
I think that you described it very well and you're right, I take back what I said in my other comments, I didn't express what I meant properly. Although I'm not quite the kind of person to watch her content and am not a fan of hers, she's definitely a beautiful and talented woman who is unfortunately just being used by fascists to discredit us, only because she's enthusiastic and their lives are dark and hateful.
I just noticed that it got weirdly negative about OTHER trans people, and not the ones we should have issues with (transmeds, pick-me’s, etc).

I’m talking specifically the non-passing or the successful, and generally the sub just tends to get so absolutely negative. I was once told that “no cis woman will ever respect us” and it got hugely upvoted. 

Then there’s the comments about Dylan such as stating her transition is for clout because that’s what she made a brand off of, how she’s making us look bad on the big screen, and so on. Just really stupid takes, now put that on any other successful trans woman.

And there’s also the whole “Lia Thomas RUINED trans people in sports she’s a fucking traitor” which happened.

Honestly the sub just sucks.
>Which is so backwards because we’ve heard what some men will say when they don’t think any women are around. It scared us. It didn’t give us ideas ffs.

This. Holy shit, so much this. I don't want to think about some of the conversations I've heard when they thought they were out of earshot. Outside of friends and some family, I do not want to be around men anymore and I'm still boymoding pretty much everywhere.
Literally this there are two trans masc men in my friend group me being mtf all the cis friends thought that the only way to get boobs was to get surgery
Not by any absolute, universal definition.
They can be, if you define those words in a way that causes them to be, but you aren't de facto hateful if you don't.

If that is your threshold for considering someone transphobic, that term becomes pretty meaningless.
I'll admit, I like FIB.
I'm not saying it's our fault, neither am I saying it's her fault. It's just that the fact she is that famous (and focuses specifically on the trans topic) means she will influence how a lot of people see the trans community because people generalize. It's not her obligation to present herself more seriously and virtuously, but it'd definitely help in making our community look better.
Sorry, this is super unrelated, but it’s super exciting to see a fellow member of the Eve Council c:
Lia Thomas....the middlingly successful body builder?
I disagree.
And you didn't answer my question. So I suspect that you are sealioning, and not discussing in good faith.
It’s always fun to see another comrade! It’s a great name am I right???
The same one with the crazy never before seen huge wild record (the same one which was beaten less than a year later)
>I disagree

That's fair enough, I'd be happy to hear the specifics if you're up for sharing them. 


>How do you define sex? Chromosomally? Hormonally? Organs at birth?

In the context of identifying it, by visible indicators like body shape, facial features, etc. I'm not anyones doctor so my identifying is only used for shallow social differences, and there are no horrible consequences if I happen to be wrong, just a ""ah, sorry"".

if you mean how I define sex on a conceptual level rather than in practice, I suppose it would be based on what gonads a person has, just to pick a relatively unambiguous function. Obviously living creatures come in a wide variety so any single defining factor can be insufficient for certain scenarios, but that is the case with most categories. 


>I suspect that you are sealioning, and not discussing in good faith.

You can suspect that, but I feel that it's fruitless to speculate on the motivation of others. You don't have to respond if you don't wish to, and you don't need to justify why to anyone, you don't owe me any answers.
Want an even cooler name?

Evelyn is derived from Norman Aveline c:

And due to etymology Evelyn is the diminutive of Eve and not the other way around lol
I see, apparently she meets the requirements for low testosterone to keep swimming competitively. She took testosterone suppressors for two years so her levels are low even for cis women. (Which is bad for your bones, don't add that to your transition goals)
Your definition fails on a simple factual basis; look up the guevedoce.

If your classification system fails regularly *it is a bad system*.

Your problem is that you are ignorant, so much so that you don't know what you don't know. This is also called the Dunning-Kruger effect.
> Evelyn is the diminutive of Eve

Okay, THAT is kinda fucking sick. Def gonna use that from now on.

""Name's Eve, Evelyn for short""
And that’s barring the fact her skill degraded strongly. Her times are incomparable to where she used to stand in terms of time itself. Placement wise she actually stayed more or less in the same upper echelon. She had good games and bad games but in general she was consistently a top-tier swimmer so who’d of fucking thought it would translate over proportionally
>If your classification system fails regularly it is a bad system

Depends on the useage of the system and whether those using it expect it to be all encompassing or not. 

What is your suggested better alternative system to define whether a human is male or female? 


>Your problem is that you are ignorant, so much so that you don't know what you don't know

I'm fully aware of the existence of a variety of intersex conditions, and I specifically mentioned that the variety of humans means that the classifications will not always apply. 

I'm curious what point you're making though. Do you really feel that a categorization can only be useful if it applies in all cases? Most categories used in daily life would then fail to meet your threshold.
You keep moving your goalposts, I don't feel this is productive. Have a nice day!"	12gai57	trans	3006	0.95	2023-04-09 05:56:40

Happy is always more attractive
Happy and still hot. Good for you!
Imagine being that good looking in two genders. I could never! Congrats and keep it up x

Was?! Being Happy makes you hot, Congrats Dude! 🔥
I’m so happy for you!! 🤩👍 You look great!
MCR for life! I really do think that their song The End. is the ultimate trans man anthem. It's my tranthem.
You've got some anime protagonist hair
From hot to hot but in another font
Happy > Hot. Also you look like a chill dude who'd be so much fun to spend a cold afternoon indoors with.
You look very aesthetically pleasing in both pictures. I wish you all the happiness.
Look like someone who knows where the cool record shop is
average mcr fan slay
Happiness>Hotness!  Do whatever makes you happy 😁
You're handsome as fuck, homeskillet :>
That's the goal!! Keep up the good Being You
I love your shirt bro
So now you're happy as well.
From cute and hot to cuter and hotter
Congrats dude! I had the same thing in the other direction and it's no comparison, even on days I feel awkward
the hair is awesome
Was? You are hot now too tbh, hot and happy
A small price to pay for salvation.
You fool. Your confidence and self-worth makes you hotter. Hell yeah
The fuck you mean was? Just saying I'm bi and l probably wouldn't date the person on the left but would definitely date the person on the right.
How do you get your hair to do that? It's defying gravity
Dude, that hair, I love it! It's so fun!
Ngl new you kinda hotter
King 🙋‍♂️❤️
Flannel for the win every time. 🤘
You were hot, now you're hot and self confident!
Bro went from emo to grunge <3
love the hair, and your kickass mcr shirt dude!!
""Was""
Nah, still are. V handsome
I think I was a pretty hot dude
But nothing makes me happier than ""ma'am""
I have located a fellow mcr trans brother.
happiness is so much more important than ""being hot""

&#x200B;

it's so wonderful that you're being yourself

&#x200B;

also, you're still hot, so...
Still hot, but also handsome as frick.
Mail me that dress?
Happiness > what cis straight men may find hot 

Tho deciding to be your true self is a real power move. Gigachad energy right there!

And you still look very handsome 

(Hell yes at least on this sub I'm allowed to compliment ppl the way I want)
Mister you are still Hot
Who’s to say you can’t rock both? Boys can wear dresses and makeup too ✌🏻You look awesome btw! Happiness is a great look on you
You looked great in drag. 
Happy is better 🥰
I always love seeing trans before/after photos because no matter what expression someone is making you can always see the subtle difference that shows that the before was more of a performance and how much happier they really are in the after. ☺️❤️
Like the change, like the album. Glad you've found yourself.
Tf you mean was
Looking good my guy 👍
And your happiness is far more important.
Happy is definitely better. I love your hair! Hell, your whole style rocks.
And still hot
Still hot dude, good look!
If only we could just trade bodies, I have a manly body with muscles and would die to look like the left pic
NGL you weren't hot then but you are handsome now
whats the difference you got a shit haircut?
Now you're hot and happy! :)
Your still attractive wym 🥰😌
still are ngl
I have the same shirt as you on the right haha. Haven’t worn it in years since I grew out of that phase after I was like 13 but still have it. (I actually had a duplicate as well but I think I only kept one)
Good for you dude. Happy for you. 💜
Dude, you’re still hot
Uh which one wasn’t hot Im lost cause both pics look equally hot
Still hot
You’re still hot!! Also nice MCR t-shirt btw
Bro you still 🔥
Still hot
you are still hot fym dude 😭
bro dropped the coldest transition (joke on tik tok transition between two scenes)
Makes me happy to see you happy xx you're rocking it!!
Why not both hot and happy?
you look really happy now, and that worth a million times more than hotness
Who says you aren't hot now? 😊
what do you mean you were hot. i dont think that has changed
What do you mean was?? You're hotter than ever dude!
You act as if you're no longer hot
Now your hot too
""yeah I'm hot and now I'm also happy"" FTFY
Dude you still be hot. But soo happy you are happy now too
was? nah bro, still are
Still really hot my dude :D
Hey dude. I remember reading a paper that attractiveness is facial symmetry and high masculine and feminine traits. If you're on a lot of Testosterone you'll look as good but don't worry about it. I find you just as attractive because of what you must've gone through and I like feminine guys so idk it's how you look at it
Still hot
Would rather be happy than hot. Now you are both, because dang you are still hot.
Happiness is hot so there!
And even hotter!
Broski you look better now (edit) also love the shirt
Wow... You re cute!!👍☺️
Be true to yourself and that is all that matters
It seems like all transmacs listen to mcr 
Loving to see it
Happy & hot*
Still hott ☺️ also happiness is all anyone can ask for glad to see people enjoying being themselves
Wow, that's epic! Congratulations!
Dude you're still hot??
and hot
Naw you still just as hot possibly more
the latter is the important one!
Maybe, but you look cool and interesting now.
You're a pretty cute guy
aw you look great
And hot
Still hot

Hot and happy*
you're still hot as a guy
You’re still hot
I agree you were hot. But not happy. Now I'm guessing you se more the real you. Wish I looked like you in you before picture.
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY MY FATHER TOOK ME INTO THE CITY TO SEE OUR MARCHING BAND (my autocorrector actually fild it for me lol)
And handsome

> tranthem

I've never heard that phrase before!! I *love* it!! Personally, my tranthem is ""When You We're Young"" by The Killers. There's a line that goes ""You sit there in your heartache waiting on some beautiful boy to save you from your old ways"" and, well, I am the beautiful boy I was waiting for all my life to save me. 

I'll give ""The End"" another listen, too :3
This is high praise 🥺 Thank you!!! 💙

Thank *very* much for this!! 💙
This is the first time somebody's ever called me ""Mister"" (I've had sir, and man, and dude, but never a mister) and I'm elated, thank you <3
Oh for sure! I have something of an interest in I guess what I could call drag? Am I allowed to do that, if I'm AFAB, but a dude? I do enjoy getting did up sometimes again, it's just that well, that's all it is, is getting did up. It was a costume. An act. Something I like to, when I'm done having fun with it, shed off, and be authentic. I spent way too damn long hiding behind all that hair haha. I'm still flabbergasted there was some quiet, content little dude hiding under all that!
Happy is best 😌☺️
Thank you!! I really appreciated this comment. I certainly feel that difference, in my skin, which finally fits me more comfortably :3
Oh shhh 🤭🥺 I appreciate ya
Thanks, friend 😌
Exactly my own thoughts on the matter 🥰
Thanks so much, I appreciate that a *lot* ☺️
Thanks, friend, I appreciate that! ☺️
 If you're mad about my haircut, don't even *think* about what I'm going to have cut off next! 😇
They transitioned I think.
Same here
Not me listening to MCR while looking at trans reddit. 😶
MCR for Transmascs. NIИ for Transfems
Lucky!!!
i would literally murder to be you rn omg
I'm writing this letter and wishing you well
they mean you were never hot /s
omg I love that.
I’ve always liked the answer to “what do you want to be when you grow up?”  

Happy.
No worries! Also hahaha just saw your profile name thats hilarious, i love it
ive spent so much money on mcr merch over the last 2 months, my favourite shirt is the ""ill be seeing you"" shirt from the three cheers era
They were the first real band I got into. I was about that age. I'm not 21. Also, I came up with tranthem. I love to say it. Boys Will Be Boys by Miles McKenna and Reflection from Mulan are some other good trans songs.

You know what [here's my trans playlist.](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3tL3d3zFNUTY7o6KxUsWtb?si=ejCkdriHQuSZXUUMnAG-mQ&app_destination=copy-link)
I’m AMAB but love that song. Carry on, talk like a gentleman. Brandon Flowers hits different I think because he went through a lot of trauma growing up.
I’m sure if you’re looking to actually be APART of a drag show, you could talk to whomever is running it and give them your situation. There’s a ton of cis women who do the drag style makeup and costumes on Tik Tok and there’s this one AFAB NB person that does horror drag and they’re fantastic. I’d just ask around if that’s something you’re interested in 🥰
I would never
as a transfem, MCR is my life
I've had the tickets for two years now since they had to postpone their Aus tour, it's very long awaited!! Pretty sure I'm gonna cry like the WHOLE time
Ngl I wouldn't blame you in the slightest I feel u so hard
mama we all go to hell. oh well now mama, were all gonna diiiieeee!
Emotional damage

That's a based quote. That one's always spoke to me, too.
Oh thank you, I sat there forever trying to come up with a clever username lmao! I appreciate you noticing!
Ohh, good choice! You got good taste in music and merch.
Ohhhhh, mans got the hook up!! I needed some good music tonight! Thanks bro!

EDIT: Banger after banger. Every transmasc here needs to listen to this right now.
Maybe I should more seriously pursue it! Like, that goth chick, that was genuinely a part of me. Like, I could have girlmoded in any number of ways. But I enjoyed that aesthetic and did indeed have fun with it at times. Of course, there was the crushing and consuming dysphoria I was using the Hot Goth GF act to try to compensate for (like if I was a cool enough girl, I'd magically be comfortable being a girl? It didn't work, obviously, because I'm here) but I did like to play that part here and there. It had its perks, and the aesthetics were, if I do say so myself, immaculate, but it always felt like putting on my costume and going on stage, not like.... getting dressed and going to the grocery store.
Yeah... Same.. Never listened toNIN in my life...

Besides pretty sure Gerard is literally some flavor of trans femme! Lol
I’m seeing them Sunday! 🙌 finallyyyyy
its not serious dont worry, op is very visibly good lookin, just like you prolly, idk why but everyone whos lgbt is just really hot.
Well you did really well! Im sooo bad at coming up with funny names so i just stuck with the autogenerated one
thank you :3333333 <3<3<3<3<3
I’m like 60% sure he said he identified as trans before
I know right!! I'm in the middle of Sydney and Brisbane so I decided to go to Brisbane to see them earlier lollll this 6 hour drive is gonna kill me, I hope u enjoy!!!! It's gonna be so good!!
Haha, hey, at least frosties are tasty!
Haha I’m road tripping as well! It’ll be worth it for sure. Drive safe and have fun!!

You, lady, are beatifull, and extra cute, i wish i could hug you and compliment you for your look
you look like a younger jennifer lawrence!
I don’t have the balls to wear anything feminine or put makeup in my face, hard to live as trans in a godstricken country. Don’t want to be nabbed by religious dept.. Fugg it I’m so jealous of you guys 🥺
No wrinkles in the flag! Somebody knows how to use an Iron.

No but jokes aside you look great!

Very cool, u do way better eyeliner than me, I can do eyeshadow kinda well but eyeliner I get my partner to do for me, but u do a better job than even them

Damn girl you look amazing. How do you do it?

Gosh, you're gorgeous! And your eyeliner is spot on

You look extremely ordinary and feminine. Like, the kind of people you just go ""well, they exist, I guess"" - unless you told me I would never guess you're trans. Congrats!

You're real pretty, too!
I barely noticed it, but you look good. I think that is essentially the point of eyeliner from what I have gathered; so good job. You found a style and amount that compliments your look. Nice!

😍😍😍
Omg, so pretty!!!!! 💖😍
Wow 🥰
You’re so pretty, I love your hair
Damm you very beautiful

Will you marry me?
Hey the greatest thing to hear and see and feel is the joy, the love, the happiness of a friend, a family member or a total stranger, is that the love that they have of themselves within. A good and happy heart radiates inside your chest but also pulsates outwardly surrounding you, your environment the climate .Yes a cloudy or rainy will be grey or wet but you will still  see and feel the warmth  the sun.  This picture is a beautiful picture because to see your smile is to hear you voice sing, laugh and say to not only the world, but truly/ truthfully also to yourself .   When you look into that mirror of yours you will always love yourself no matter what!!

:)
❤️❤️❤️
Thank youuu🥰
I use a variation of the curly girl method ☺️☺️
Ahhh you are too kind🥹🥰
Comfy is the only way😂
Thank you so much!!💖
Same!
I’m 1 year and 4 months in ☺️
My hair is naturally very curly, and I use a variation of the curly girl method when I style it!
Aw thank you so much 🥰 sorry for the envy tho I’ve been there… I’m still there😂
r/curlyhair tbh is great. They have essentially a whole guidebook on curly hair maintenance
What's the curly girl method?
Omg I love fall and winter, and just wearing fleece sweaters no bra no shirt and lounging around the house.
I didn’t see what subreddit this was and thought I was looking at a curlyhair post!
It’s a way to style naturally curly hair with certain products and diffusing and similar techniques! There’s a ton of how to’s on YouTube and google if you think it’s something g that could work for you!
Same
Ah! Gotcha! Dang, I don't think I have naturally curly lol. But I'll definitely look into it!!"	xx3p5c	trans	2853	0.98	2022-10-06 12:11:40

I love your hair!!

I get the thing of liking looking like your from another time. I saw a drama about a year ago which had women in upper class Victorian dresses and realized I was kinda jealous.
A real beauty!
Damn you can step on me
You're look is awesome, like if Dick Tracey was a hot chick ❤❤❤

Nice!
You look absolutely gorgeous!
Loving the detective vibe you have going here.
Mmmm

You look absolutely beautiful
What a really neat picture!  It captured **You.**

Mother, my apologies, Mother, my apologies, Mother, my apologies
You have gorgeous hair!
Get it, Carmen Sandiego!!! Fierce as fuck!!
So classy.
You're very beautiful and the pictures are super classy
You're killing it! That hat looks phenomenal on you, abs the coat pulls the whole thing together. Well done, madame!
Hat
I dont mean to sound rude, but the filter makes you look like you where the boss of the mafia
As a younger man, I would have bumbled my way through a terribly awkward pickup line sourced from some black and white Hepburn movie or something. I’m loving the aesthetic.
Omg you look like a noir style cop in an old movie, I’ve never seen someone pull it off so well! The stocking and hat really pull the outfit too and the (what I’m Assuming is a Denim jacket) is such a nice touch! Also Happy new year’s girl!!
fucking Noir Heroine bullshit, I love to see it
Love the outfit. You look super hot.
You're beautiful
Happy New Year ✨🙏✨

This would look really cool with a sepia or black and white filter as well
Lovely 😍🌹
Con un cigarro en la mano parecería una actirz.de los años 20, feliz año nuevo
You look like you should be in some sort of movie set in the past! Love that outfit, gives me detective vibes
So pretty!
Fantastic and perfect visual effect, though I'll always prefer colored or colorized pics, no matter what time they're from. Congrats, you do look beautiful, you also have an amazing taste for clothes too!
You look so good!

You’re sooo pretty omg. You look like a girl boss from the 1970’s or something. love it!!

Very pretty, but do another with the hat tilted back to show your eyes.

My aunt got me this bathing suit as a coming out gift! I’m so happy!		"Its amazing I love it cool aunt award goes to her
Yes, definitely cool Aunt, and good taste, too!  It looks great on you!  🏳️‍⚧️😊🙋🏻‍♀️
I just got my bathing suit too! It was SUPER hard to find though
Your aunt is a wonderful woman! And you look gorgeous in that bathing suit <3
Sooo cuuuute 😍
Listen, I know the focus is on you, but damnnn that's a nice bathroom
Congrats beautiful lady!
V cute ☺️
beautiful 😊😍😊
You look gorgeous!
I am looking Respectfully 👀
Here's a rose 🌹 for your aunt for being so sweet!

Enjoy your summer, girlfriend!  ❤️
It looks amazing on you. Tbh i had to take a double take on the subreddit, didnt think it was the trans subreddit for a moment
You are beautiful and so glad for you to have a supportive family member which is so so helpful even if it is just one person (not sure who else supports you) I really only have one of the five I have come out to.  The other four are supportive but also I think they think it is a phase blaahhhhh.  They come around in time so it seems.  Patience is such a big part of this with everyone involved.
Sexsi!🏳️‍⚧️
Omg love it!! My aunt got me pizza 😂
❤️❤️
Thanks aunt.

Thaunt.
That's awesome, one cool Aunt you have 😎
congratulations!!!! lookin good
You just came out and you can already pull of a bathing suit like that? That’s awesome! High key jealous.
dang i want coming out gifts 🥺
shopping for girl clothes is stressful yo!!
I gasped. That’s a real cute swimsuit!
ok here I thought Eve from Invincible was transition goals, you took the 1st place
you look beautiful girly!! go out and rock that swimsuit
You have an awesome aunt! And that suit is super cute 🥰
What a cool aunt! That’s such a nice suit and congrats on coming out!
So cute! My wife and I both love the suit!!
It's *beautiful*!
Yay!!! You look great!
Congrats!!! When I came out not too long ago, my dad went in a 10 minute rant about how he’ll support me, but me clothes, whatever I need. I refused his clothes offer out of embarrassment but it’s alright. I may ask once my body looks more fem, after I grow out my hair and such

Side note: every time I see a post here within reading the sun first, I keep trying to remember if I joined a selfie subreddit or smth, since everything seems to look so natural in here lol
You look so happy and it's so contagious. Thank you for sharing 🙂
You pull it off well, you look totes adorbs 🥰
You’re so cute!
You are looking amazing, my god💖💖
Nice! You look great!
that's amazing!
Omg that's amazing, I literally also got a swimsuit today lol
Nice gift, you look very happy... And young haha
One of the best feelings you'll get (there will be more). The moment when you think, there's me, I'm a girl, staring back at me, and from a certain angle no dick, no ugly balls, just longed for front bum, wide hips and maybe a set of tits. - and who cares how big those tits are! Just to know that they're there and  all the excess bits you never liked having are gone. Could be a moment, could be forever - all you know us you can't stop staring!
My pencil is thicker
Omg! Looks amazing! Who makes that? I must get one!
perfect gift!
You look beautiful. Perfect.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💋💋💋💋
That suit looks really good on you! God bless your aunt, and congrats for being out
You look amazing!
very pretty
Beautiful you.
nice swinsuit I wish i had your figure
Haha yeah! It was great
Yeah I had to get a little skirt thing separately for my two piece to stop hide any slips haha
what did you get?
I’m glad she was so accepting! And thank you!
My aunt married rich haha
Hehe good ❤️
Aww thank you so much! I’m not on hrt yet so I still got a while to go though
Hehe thank you so much! I’m sure you’re just as pretty!
Hehe thank you!
Awww that’s so nice! I still got a long way to go though haha
Hehe of course!
Yeah I’m happy I have her! And thank you so much!
Haha yeah my parents gave me money then I went to the mall with friends cause I didn’t want them to see me choosing
And I’m sure you’ll look sooo cute in den clothes!
Aw thank you so much!
Thanks!
Omg! I bet you look adorable!
Yeah! I’m 19 haha
I’m not for sure what it is but I’ll look when I go swimming again!
It would be nice to not have anything to slip out of my bathing suit aside from my ass... ugh I love this body but I hate the masculine parts.
Lookin great pre-HRT!
believe me, if I saw you in walmart i’d think you were a girl
Nice nice. I’m not old enough to drive yet so sadly that’s not an option for me. Once I can though, I sure as hell am going to buy some clothes since I can’t have my parents knowing my taste out of embarrassment
Ty ty
No problem, have a great day miss🤝
Tysm, it hasn't actually come yet but I hope it's good. It's my first mens swimsuit too so I'm really excited tbh
Ah, that explains it 😆
Haha yeah I feel that! You got this tho girl!
Hehe look whose talkin! You look amazing!
I’m not even on hrt yet so that means a lot 👉👈
Hehe you too!
Omg! That’s so good for you!
Hi sweetie I would highly recommend rubies !! They create bathing suits made for trans girls and I wore on my trip recently and it made me feel so comfy to wear a bikini bottom without being too paranoid. You can even put them under a bathing suit and you don’t even need to wear a skirt !!! 
It’s created by a young trans girl and her father who wanted to help his daughter feel comfy definitely worth looking into !!
Thanks!!
oh believe me, I’m pre-HRT and I showed one of my friends a pic of me in a skirt and he mistook me for a girl. total ecstasy for that entire week
Yeah!
I’ll look it up thank you!
Thank you for telling me about this. They seem very useful
I looked it up because my mom got reccomendations from other people to try it but just the basic bottoms are 40 dollars a pair... I feel bad because its handmade but its so hard to find stuff... it shouldn't be this hard to find this stuff

What a coincidence. Just this morning I was having the same idea. I'm way happier now that some people know about my true self.

Same. I love myself in a way I never did before I came out.
You are just so beauty, i hope i can get as bauty as you!

That jacket tho! 😎
Really amazing so gorgeous you also look famous I wish me and my girlfriend could be transition already.
I see so many photos of this pretty AF girl. 

I takes me ages to get remotely decent looking enough for a photo, maybe, once a month in photo decent. 

She like this everyday it seems. The effort.
Cute af jacket :) and great eyes. You look happy 😊
Being the AUTHENTIC YOU is what makes you happy, makes us all happy. Beautiful! ❤️
Good for you! You look really happy.
I wish (and a wish is a form of prayer) all people could be happy, it's sad that just because someone want to live outside of social norms society needs to crucify them, so silly when you you really think about it...
We need to get rid of boxes, most people when honest don't fit in societies boxes anyway...
I kicked the shit out the box they put around me, and life is magical ❤️💜💚
Jess you always look beautiful and are a inspiration to others. You give hope that we can do what makes us happy. To be true to ourselves. Show that we are not alone 😊💜
You should be happy. Stay winning <3
You go girl & you look fab
It's literally the best, isn't it? I wouldn't trade it for anything 🥰

You’re trans so you’re already there 💖 looking cute as heck sis! Love your shorks 🥰
Thank you so much ❤️❤️ ahahaha, you guys are helping me too!! Even this Monday couldn’t bring me down. 🥰 happy time change Monday!!!
I don’t even know what to say, just… thank you 🥺❤ everyone should be happy to be trans. Even if it can be a struggle, the joy is the most I can possibly imagine ❤🎊
Thank you 🥰 You too!! And have a great Monday please ❤
THE BEST. I wouldn’t even trade it for a steam deck!!!
Right??? I constantly wonder how this is even real. Being trans is so awesome. It makes my head spin that this is even possible at all. I love being trans SO much. It’s a fucking miracle. 💓
Why not?
It's called Gender Dysphoria. If you're opening to learning more about this, please look that up on Google. Most of these people experience depression due to their dysphoria. It's not something that has to be forever. You will find yourself, and most likely, it is with the sex you were born with. :) good luck and talk to smart people- this page and a lot like it is filled with all kinds of things that may not lead you where you want to go.
No, literally slay. You should go slay dragons, monsters, and evil tyrants. You sure look lije you're capable of that.

Aww, thanks! You're making me tear up sis! ❤️
Of course you're welcome 💜😊. It really is a joyful thing. 

Do you mind if I send you a private message for some input on how I am doing
Doesn't make me happy tbh. Wish I was just born female, would've been so much easier. I don't really understand being happy being trans, it's been nothing but suffering for me.
I searched for ir before, it's a terrible feeling, thanks for your help, i hope i can be happy at least one day, in all of my 5629 days of life, i feel like if they were never happy.
That’s not what Paris Hilton was talking about????? This whole time I’ve been wearing chain mail and mastering the art of the blade????
Better being trans than being an egg.
[deleted]
Okay but why would that make me happy?
Well, you gotta do something that gives you euphoria, and thats difficult being an egg. So yes. Having your gender figured out is way better than being in denial/not knowing.

If you dont do anything about dysphoria of course it wont go away.  Ive hit Rock bottom Multiple Times, yet always stood back up. Sorry to be so harsh, but get your Stuff together and try to improve your life. Youre the only one who can do so.

"(FTM) I was asked ""The Gender Question"" in the best way possible"	"I was standing in class, signing yearbooks and stuff, when all the sudden, the ""big and tough"" kid came up to me and tapped me on the shoulder. He said he had a question. I was prepared for the worst, but then he got really soft and awkward and said, ""I've never been sure about this, so I wanted to ask you... are you a boy or a man?"" And it was clear that he meant to say Girl instead of man, but it was so funny that both of us just burst out laughing. I eventually told him that I am a boy, and he was glad to know. 

I'm so happy that I was asked that! So funny, oh my god."	"I had a similar experience back in college when I was about 1.5yrs on T, passing 50/50. This big jock dude in one of my classes came up to me and asked, ""So are you a lesbian or just gay?"" 

I think about this all the time
this is the version of ""the question"" that i like. not asking becase you have to know everything but asking so you know what to say and what not too.
Honestly that is so heartwarming
Cute!
This is nice, to hear there are people out there that actually are considerate of others ! And extra nice when it’s unexpected!
Nice

I LOVE THIS MAN
I had a similar experience. When I came to school the first day after telling my teachers about my new name and pronouns, the teacher was taking attendance and used my chosen name. The classic like football player dude (who is probably gay now that I think about it) goes “wait who’s that?” And then later asks me if I was a dude, and when I said yes, he gave me a hilarious nickname.
That’s cute af
There was one kid in my school, I think they were 12 or something, they were a year older, and they looked super androgynous and I never found out what gender they were, it was pretty cool actually
I’m a singer and I got clocked and this dude asked me if I was a soprano or a tenor 😹😹😹💕
I run the Kids area at my work an one of the parents was telling their children to “listen to this kind-“  and they paused, looked at me, and said “hey what pronouns do you use?” 

I replied “he/him” and they continued as if they hadn’t paused “listen to this kind young man while you play ok?” 

Made me so happy!
Don't worry, lad. After puberty finishes, you'll be a real man!

Jk

But seriously, I'm happy it turned out OK for ya.

Have a wonderful day, dude.
literally i love when people ask me The Question, especially if its little kids. 

as long as its not with bad intent, i think its sweet that someone cares enough to ask. any time someone asks and backtracks with ""well i dont wanna be rude/im not trying to be rude"" i always tell them that i dont mind and id be happy to answer questions, id rather them ask than be misinformed.
whenever anyone asks me “what are you??” i just say i’m white and whenever someone says “are you a boy or a girl??” my nonbinary answer is “who tf cares”
Ignorant question, which I hope is perceived in the positive manner in which it was intended: is it ok to ask for pronouns? Specifically over text chat with a new coworker.

Like, how do you say to a semi-stranger ""I'm an ally, I will respect your pronouns, and I'm not a threat to you.""?
That's the type of content where i always comment ""aand now fuck""
I think about this one time where I was on my motorcycle and a old lady came up to me and said I shit you not “i know your a girl but I’ll keep it a secret” I still laugh at it till this day
LOL that has a vaguely threatening air to it, like imagine that said while you're being challenged to do some stupid stuff. ""Are you a boy or are you a *maaaaaaan*?""
that is actually incredibelly cute, I adore people like that, glad you didn't have any problems and laughed with somebody that respects you :)
And that's the day mr big and tough realized he might not be straight after all
Disgusting

Love your strength to be YOU!
And.... which one is it? Don't leave us hanging
Defining lesbians as special gay. Bog standard gay may feel disappointed and double gay are left out completely.
What was the nickname?
Hope you have a great day!
You can just ask their pronouns. :) Certain people may be offended by it, but most LGBT people will appreciate it in my experience
If you want to you can just give your pronouns. For example say ""Hello, I'm X and use x/x pronouns"" that way it feels more natural, but honestly as long as you respect pronouns you're on the right track.
*bonk* but yes
Well, shes wrong though 🤌🤌

I’m glad you can find humor in it though, I would’ve felt so self conscious if the reverse was said
:D
Ignorant attempts at understanding should be praised. It's a chance for people to learn and asking questions is the start of learning. This is like condemning a child for asking about race, they literally don't know better.
ok nerd

I'd say mostly gay, but I learned to love as a lesbian and that will always stick with me.
Sorry it took forever to reply- life yk- 
My name is Rowan, so he gave me the nickname Roman, then proceeded to sing row row row your boat. He makes absolutely no sense but it was kinda sweet
In the end I’m a pretty chill guy literally nothing can piss me off yeah it kinda shocked me at first but in the end I laugh about it from time to time 😅
Pretty sure they're just transphobic.
respect 🌟
Fuck that's one of the best sentences I've ever heard and it's incredibly relatable... I'll be keeping that phrase in my back pocket from now on
Sorry if i word this wrong just trying to understand. So you used to be in lesbian relations girl/girl but after coming out you consider yourself mostly gay guy/guy? Trans lesbian here trying to learn our world better. Sexuality is interesting. Im pan but i could never see myself long term with a male. Does that make me a lesbian even though a like to play with dicks? Lol Life is wild.
Or they've never met, seen, or know of a trans person and have never been exposed to trans people online that could share any amount of information with them. I don't blame the college freshmen that doesn't know how to act around people different than those they grew up with. my Chinese roommate freshman year didn't know anything about american culture and I simply told him about things he didn't know about, I didn't chastise him and call him a ____-phobe, he needed education not a dressing down.
I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I'm happy to share what I meant there! I grew up in a very rural and conservative part of the US, so I really had no exposure to trans people until I was an adult. As a teenager, I felt & expressed my gender variance and non-conformity in the only way I'd been exposed to: identifying as a lesbian. This identity granted me permission to align myself closer to masculinity and further from the ""womanhood"" I felt forced upon me in relationships with straight men. 

Turns out, my sexuality is very fluid and when I'm comfortable in my gender, my attraction to men (and really only queer men) feels much more comfortable. I could never see myself with a man as a woman, but I'm happy to identify as a mostly gay man (though I think all genitals are great and fun and feel good, and I'm very t4t)
The person you replied to here was actually calling the person you replied to initially transphobic. They have the safe profile picture things though.
Sweet, thanks for the explanation! I can see that. Whwn attracted to mem i tend to be attracted fo more fem types. I grew up in a very conservative area too and didnt come out till 36. Liking girls and being trans mtf was a very puzzeling feeling my whole life. Glad you are living your best life!
Yeah I meant the commenter not the person in the original post."	niiniv	trans	2764	0.98	2021-05-22 13:28:57
So Happy 😭		"I came out to dad tonight and this was his response ❤️
Congratulations!

""Common in the tech industry"". 

Called out accurately. Why worry about the case when inside is what counts.
It is common in the tech industry bahahahah. I feel seen by the dad
What if that was the norm? Think how much better the world would have bean.💖
I'm not crying, you're crying!

That was very sweet. Happy for you :D
I feel like “ok, give me hug” is the ultimate dad response and the tightness of my throat and chest suggests I’ll cry about this all morning 🥹🥲
Lmao he really said yeah no shit your a stereotype
I'm gonna cry 🥺
I really hope it goes the same way for me im so nervous to come out to my parents
Wow, can I apply to be your sister?
I almost cried while at work, this is beautiful 🥹 ❤️!
>It's common in the tech industry 



I feel like I've been called out /s


Jokes aside, your dad is a king... We wish more people like him.
Meanwhile, my dad, who's a damned psychiatrist.....

Sorry to be a downer, congrats, that's a lively response.
Incredible! So happy for you
Im so proud of you for doing this and i hope youre really happy with this too
So beautiful. I am very happy you have people in your life who love you and not just who they want you to be. 🙌
Well I’m balling my eyes out. So happy for you
Did you give him a hug?
I love this! Made my day to see it!
My dad is in the tech industry, and I know this will not be his response. He’s 76. And as much as I fear coming out to him, I also can’t bear to think of him passing away without knowing the real me. But he did not handle my coming out as bi well and has already made comments against non binary and trans people.
Exactly as it should be 🥰 It's so wonderful to see there are accepting and loving parents out there! I'm happy for you 😊
I came out to my sister as bi and she said I was bi myself. Then I re came out to her as pan and she said ""singleness is a pan-demic and you tested positive"" because I told her I bet she couldn't make a single pun out of it. She's supportive though lol. I'm thinking I might actually be bisexual though, I'm confused about my sexuality atm.
""Its common in the tech industry""

God damnit💀💀
That's super awesome! Wish I had a family like that :/
This made me smile, a lot
Now that's how to be a supportive parent.  I am so happy for you dear.
Awww so much congratulations!!! I’m so happy for you!!!
Congratulations. I'm still trying to build a relationship with my father and I'm hoping I can meet him before he succumbs to kidney disease
This is amazing. I hoped so bad that I would hear this from people when I started coming out, and so far I have not. I'm extremely lucky that I've been accepted so far, but I wished so bad that someone would tell me they knew the whole time.

Im so happy for you!!! ❤️
That's so sweet
I’m so happy for you 😭😭😭
Hell yeah! I love supportive parents!!!
that’s so wonderful!
“It’s common in the tech industry”
IGHT where are my other networkers🙋‍♀️
ITS COMMON IN THE TECH INDUSTRY
Now my dada next I guess.
Not him saying it’s common in tech when I work in tech 😭😭
AWW this is so wholesome im so happy for you <3
❤️🥺

Also the “common in the tech industry” 💀💀
“common in the tech industry” he full on called us out. I’m so happy for you!
Thank you everyone 💜
I hope every one of you valid and beautiful/handsome people can have this kind of happiness sooner rather than later
icl little bit jealous
W parent ONG
To the best of my knowledge, I was the first trans vp in the tech industry. This is the sort of reply I expect from my industry colleagues, but this makes me happy nonetheless, especially since it’s your dad. You tell him we are proud of him (and you of course!) ❤️❤️❤️
Happy for you 🥹
So happy for you ♡
Best parent ever, I’m so jealous 😭😭😭
Congratulations! Coming out can be absolutely petrifying, I’m so glad you have such strong support from him
😭 thanks for sharing it with us 😭
I'd say, more common in tech. We're still a small minority.
This makes me feel a lot better about going into tech once I’m out of college 😅
Reminds of what my mom said when I first told her. Unfortunately, my dad has passed away so I never told him,but I should have.
I'm legit gonna ugly-cry, fr. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Your dad being this accepting and loving is such a monumental blessing.  My dad was the opposite.. typical heartless cop way of engaging with anyone or thing they don't understand nor empathize with, but I think that makes me even happier for you, lol?
Aww, that is so sweet
Fucking lit, congrats! ! 💜💜
This is so freaking wholesome help 😭❤️
I wish that’s how my parents would react to me coming out. But granted I am scared to.
I got the chills and cried and it's not even my dad approving me. Thanks for sharing you deserve acceptance!
“It’s common in the tech industry” I’m gonna cry 🤣
Your father is awesome, I am so very happy for you. The ""now come give me a hug"" brought a tear  to my eye, exactly what I would want to hear in that situation. Thank you so much for sharing, I can't stop smiling. 😊🏳️‍⚧️
Why does it say stepmom on the top?
Congrats
Blessed as fuck
I wish my dad would react that way, I wonder how my stepmom would feel. Her whole thing always seemed to be that you couldn't possibly understand yourself until you were at least 18 and experiencing life first hand I guess.
That was so sweet! Congratulations :D
YOOOOO CONGRATS!!!!
i wish i had your dad he's great☺️
W dad
Wow, this is an arrow in the heart. 💘 You are very blessed to have such a supportive father. I’m very happy for you
Holy cow. This is so wholesome 🥺❤️ I think my heart just grew three sizes
“Now come give me a hug!” also made me tear up, I’m so happy you have a strong support system from him!
I wish my parents were like this 😭
Can I have your parents??? Please
I came out to my dad and he no talks me anymore XD
Congratulations!!!!
That’s amazing.  I hope my parents take it close to how your dad did.  I hope you’re feeling good
Thats sooo sweet I love that 🥰🥰🥰
my mom just responded with ""ok"" 😂
These are the posts that give me life. So happy for you! ❤️
can your dad be my dad?
I’m jealous 🥹♥️
i want to cry, this is wholesome. i wish my parents supported me too
Is it bad that I am jealous
How all trans ppl want their parents to react and respond
Amazing, this is what humanity could and should be.

Simply accept and embrace one another.

Your family is the family that we all wish that we had.

Be the change that we desire.
That is so sweet 🥲
💜
It's uplifting seeing people get positive responses from parents for their authenticity. You deserve every ounce of it.
Congratulations 🫶🏾
If wanna upvote but you’re at 420
I play in a D&D campaign with 6 other players.  I'm one of 3 trans players at the table.  *All* of us work in tech.
Trans peeps and tech industry is like pb&j.
I can vouch for this. In my gaggle of transfemmes, almost all of us work in tech.
This single handly made my day bc I was afraid this wasn't the case, (ik Furries are common in tech)
Each of the big tech companies have trans/nb groups numbering in the hundreds, if not thousands. 

Heck, my team of 40ish has four trans women on it, two of whom are in leadership roles lol.
Will be?
My 76-year-old Republican, Catholic dad is incredibly supportive of my trans son. Love can do a lot. If he can reject bigotry for someone he loves, everyone can.
That's alright, I'll cry for the both of us 😭
i wish i could cry :/

it is indeed super sweet though
I have more a fear of my classmates we have really conservative people in our class
I'm praying it does for you! ❤️
I'm thrilled beyond words ❤️
❤️
The biggest of hugs 😭
I boxed out her name and wrote that in. That way i don't give her name out and it provides context better than just her name would 😅
He definitely is! ❤️
24 hours later and I'm still riding that tsunami of happiness ✨
So what I'm hearing is I need to get into tech
Mine as well! The presence of trans people has actually made the company make better decisions imo, in treatment of trans customers. In a very bureaucracy filled field, too. And having others around is just comforting. I'm FtM and there's a fair number of us as well.
Quite possibly. Change takes time but we’ve seen it happen, and there have been plenty of cultures throughout history where this *was* the normal way to respond to trans and non-binary folk. I see no reason why that can’t re-emerge, especially as we step closer and closer to undoing the colonialism and imperialism that squashed those cultures in the first place. I don’t know when it will happen but I’m optimistic that it will.
This happened with my bi partner who came out to her catholic parents and told them I was trans/enby. They were totally accepting. What we are seeing from the right are the death throes of that kind of widespread bigotry. They won’t win.
Yikes, doesn’t sound like a welcoming environment sorry u have to go through that
Thank u
I’m so happy for you!! 🌊
They're called *programmer socks* for a reason!
The positive: we are the highest class at our school so next year I will visit another school
Good look with ur studies there

I never thought I would be able to be truly happy in my own skin, but I'm so proud of myself and the progress I've made since I discovered who I really am!		"Oh wow ur such a cutie!! 😍😍
You look beautiful and gorgeous. I have a question of how you knew and felt you were given the wrong gender? I am questioning myself and hate being called specific pronouns for they feel wrong to me. I am so sorry if this comes off really bad T-T
You look great! I’m super jealous and hope I can look as good one day
Very beautiful
So adorable :)
Beautiful! So happy for you!
you're absolutely beautiful!!! you've done such a good job transitioning and you're an inspiration!!!! 💜💜💜

Thank you 💕💕
Like the other commenter said, feelings of euphoria is definitely the biggest thing. A lot of people are under the impression that being transgender is all about dysphoria, while the opposite is actually true. It's all about the euphoria from both feeling like the gender you identify with, and being perceived as that gender by others. Before I started transitioning, I never got dysphoria, and that created a real problem with impostor syndrome, and that delayed me finally going through with my transition, thus leaving me unhappy for far longer than I needed to be. Just because you don't have gender dysphoria currently, doesn't mean you can't be trans. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask, and I'm sure me and everyone in this subreddit will be more than happy to help 💕💕
Not OP but id still like to try and help. One of the things that helped me realize I was trans was the euphoria of certain thoughts. I'm trans masc (ftm) and whenever I thought of growing up male, it always made me happier than those where I grew up female. Also, im much much happier going by he/they. The positive feelings i got from gender euphoria where mainly what made me notice. Also, never feel bad for asking for help!
hey if you need someone to talk to through some of these thoughts feel free to dm me
I know you didn't ask me but thought I'd add my two cents.

I spent about 4-5 years questioning, most of which was spent debating what it meant to be a woman. Was I confusing femininity with being a woman? I came across GC stuff and debated if it was a kink. To cut a long story short the answer was no.

I had always been effeminate, I'd embraced being gender non-conforming but the major change was when I started frequent therapy. It showed me that the last time I had been truly happy within myself was when I was exploring my gender and that being GNC wasn't enough. That was over 2 years ago and nothing has changed my mind since although I've had my fair share of doubts. I start hormones tomorrow and I'm equal parts apprehensive and excited. I'd be shocked if the doubts truly ever leave 100% but I'm confident that I'm making the right decision for me and that's all you can really do.

If you have any direct or pointed questions you'd rather ask one-to-one rather than in an open forum feel free. I'm more than happy to share and like to think I don't sugar-coat stuff.
I'm just built different 💁‍♀️
I was 20 when I started it! I was worried that I started too late, but I've been incredibly fortunate with my progress so far
Another way to look at it is that dysphoria comes in many flavours, and ""unrelenting agony"" is only one of them.

Those of us who find euphoria to be the big indicator that we are trans, tend to be more on the derealisation/depersonalisation spectrum of dysphoria, which is a general, often ill-defined feeling of being disconnected from our bodies and social roles. At worst, it can feel like living in your body and brain is just piloting a machine.

I just thought everyone was like that, and I didn't really see it as bad. Only see in hindsight that it was actually dysphoria.
Those of us who are not as pretty are generally the ones who experience dysphoria. I get misgendered even with a mask on. It does not matter what clothes I am wearing. I still get called ""dude"", ""bro"" and every other heartbreaking word on a daily basis. I've been on HRT for a year now, and it hasn't made much of a difference at all. I am seriously thinking of deleting my Reddit account because it really depresses me.
I just got Reddit and could not figure out how to respond XD That helps me a lot in some understand. Thank you
I don't really know what I want. I somehow have the urge to come back to this subreddit but the thought of being trans scares me. Yeah sure I like the idea of being a girl but is it maybe just a kink? I've been asking myself these questions for about a month (I know, not that long...) and it's really stressful. I got some help from a very nice person on this sub making myself calm down a bit. But I can understand that this person can't always have time or the motivation to listen to the weird things I'm writing in totally unstructured texts.
I'm just very unhappy whenever I think about it. Of course I have my good times and I don't cry or something like that but it always comes back. Every day.

Edit: I'm going to talk about this with a friend tomorrow. Wish me luck that I can explain it to her. It's kind of hard to put into words...
Everyone’s words helps create new sides to the picture I am trying to solve for myself. What you said really shines a new light on another side that could of been missed. I thank you
[deleted]
It can be quite overwhelming when you first discover these feelings. I know that I questioned many aspects of my life, decisions that I had made in the past trying to make things fit the narrative that I was trans. I was all-consumed by the idea, but that started to die down. I started to think a bit more rationally and logically. I found productive discussion about being trans and realised that I didn't have to have dysphoria, and that some things I'd always felt about myself probably were dysphoria and I'd just never had the words to explain it before. For the longest time I refused to say I was trans because I felt it was making a mockery of trans people without having severe dysphoria as I thought it was necessary.

Really in the end for me since I had explored for a long time previously I had that knowledge and personal experience to fall back on. It helps that I have some incredibly supportive friends around me and my ex at the time was also very supportive. I got to dress femme and have it be perfectly normal, I got to try make-up and stereotypically feminine things and realised that that's not really for me. My issue with myself was with my body and the way that I was perceived. Change of name, pronouns and now hormones and I feel more me than I ever have before. I'm nervous about taking hormones as it's a leap into the unknown, but it still feels like it's the right step.

Essentially I'm saying that you have time. It can feel, especially when on here, that you have to start right away, that you just know and you should take hormones ASAP but it's ok to take things a bit slower if you need time to figure yourself out. There are plenty of trans people who are a bit older and some that are quite a lot older that have transitioned.

Do I wish I'd realised sooner? Sure, but I know now and I have the strength of my prior experiences to know I'm doing the right thing and that can't be undervalued.
Thank you! I wish you the best with everything!
The only thing that's stressing me is my indecisiveness. The feeling that I don't know what I'm feeling. My mind is thinking of nothing but pro and con arguments but none is stronger than the other. I want to take it slow but at the same time I feel awful. Everything in my everyday life remind me of this subject. I'm going to share this with someone this afternoon hoping it will calm me down a bit and I'll start thinking rationally, taking it slow. One step at a time

Edit: I really like how everyone on this sub is supper supportive to each other and helping those who feel bad. It already helped me quite a bit"	pmz4g1	trans	2709	0.97	2021-09-12 19:17:48

A month ago i told my wife im trans. at first, she was upset. now…	"She just randomly brought it up again, a week ago i think? i was sure we we were working on getting a divorce. next thing you know, she just asks me questions. finally, she said, “listen, this is all new to me. im gonna do my best to listen and learn. i dont wanna leave you. i love you. i won’t stop you from being the real you.”

like, now she’s so supportive and listening. i don’t know what else to type. i’m just so excited that she’s just had a change of heart. she’s even going as far to help me with my wardrobe and stuff. i just wanna cry, im so happy."	"This is amazing! I’m so happy for you. This is the best possible outcome. I wish you both the best
That's wonderful! I also think it's important to temper your expectations. It is possible for her to support your transition while no longer desiring a romantic relationship with you. Based on what you've said, she sounds supportive but not committed. You can love someone even after breaking off the relationship ship. And hey, maybe nothing will change in your relationship and your wife will continue being sexually attracted to your true gender. But it's possible that she won't be, and I think it's important to be aware of that reality.
Supportive partners are amazing, and I hope she builds on this with you and keeps learning. Good luck!
It was the same for me! Sometimes our partners are scared that they’re being abandoned in a way because everything they know is going to change until they think it over and realize we aren’t going anywhere. It is a natural reaction.
Same thing happened with my wife. I came out to her in 2014 all she said was ""I'm sorry, I'm gay"" she was my girlfriend then (8 months or so into our relationship) I'm AFAB. A little while later she did this. Then anxiety is still there after all these years but the support outweighs that. Therapy helps though. Lol 😅 I'm fineeeeee.
I'm so happy for you, ai wish this was the way it would normally go. God I wish I had that but I guess you count your blessings/luck eh. Best of luck to y'all 😉💃
You've won the relationship lottery!! I love reading this outcome.....  ❤️ 🥰  Lilli~
Still go slow she is doing something hard for her!
Nice ! Get gud girl
Good on her for turning around and being willing to learn! Wish you guys the best. :)
That's wonderful! I'm so glad for you both.
You're story gives me so much hope that what happened to my ex-wife and I won't and hopefully doesn't happen often to others. I have been really depressed for a long time because I still feel like I lost my best friend the day she told me she couldn't love me the way she knew how with me being trans. Amongst other things, we split due in major part because I was no longer the man she married.

It's extremely uplifting to hear that my experience is hopefully a rarer one.
That's awsome. I'm happy for you
I'm so happy for you.
I am so happy for you, this is incredible
Mazel Tov 🖤

All the best to you both on your exciting adventure
You are a very lucky person. Very, very few trans women who are married when they come out are married to na person as understanding and open minded as your wife.

Most people--such as myself--lose everything. 

I wish you two so much good luck and so many blessings. 

Sometimes love is just too strong to be blown up by misunderstanding, stubbornness and cis/het cultural norms...
People seem to expect you to change entirely over night when you come out as trans. It's like the idea they make up of who you're gonna be scares them when in reality you don't change much at all, you just let them get to know you better. That's been the strangest thing for me, watch people who were initially weirded out or scared off work out that actually it's much nicer to know a happier me.
Go slow with her.  Because it’s your transition it’s easy to forget that this is also massive and really big and challenging for her as well.  My ex sounded like that originally.  It still ended badly.  No one’s fault, but after 20 years together, painful for us both.  Slow, gentle, open…. Good luck to both of you.
Wishing you both the best 🥺😩💙💙💙
omg i love this, i'm so happy for you! it was the same with my gf haha. we're so lucky to have loving partners who immediately put aside their learned bigotry to understand us.
Oh damn it now I'm crying too, so happy for you!
This reminds me of when I told my long time girlfriend. I thought for sure we were going to break up. Now five years later, we both identify as lesbians, and our relationship is stronger than ever!
It's so nice to see that there are people who are willing to learn and change.

Most hate comes from ignorance and your wife chose love
Awesome!!!! Similar, but not quite the same. No sex life, but she blames that more on herself (she says it's medication her Dr has her on, I think that may be part but the other is she def leans asexual.)

Word of unasked for advice: Include her on the transition. By that I mean if you get into makeup, make sure that she can get some too. New shoes, clothes? Same for her, electrolysis (I had day long sessions) either a spa day or something special for her. 
It doesn't have to be tit for that equal, but make sure she gets to come along for the ride and the fun stuff.
You go girl! I can't imagine the relief you must feel that you 2 get to stay together.
You are happy is what is important
This is great news I wish you both a great live and your wife is the best good luck ahead for you 2 both
Aw good luck with a happy marriage 🥰
Aw this makes me happy 😊
My wife did a very similar thing. This stuff takes time to process. I’m very happy for you! It really helps having someone in your corner!
That's great! Sometimes it can just take a while for people to get used to the idea, especially when the relationships involve a degree of sexual attraction or intimacy in general. I'm so glad she's come around!
I'm so happy she's willing to listen and learn, and is being supportive! I'm so stoked for you both and I wish y'all the absolute best for the future!
That's so great! Remember still to prioritize your feelings. If she starts trying to cut deals and set conditions, you need to make it clear that who you are isn't a bargaining chip. ""I won't leave you as long as you don't get surgery,"" ""Please pretend to be cis in front of certain relatives,"" ""I don't like your new name I want to call you X"" are all big red flags. Some people who are sort of uneasy might say they're okay with you being trans but ""not that kind of trans."" Not to be a downer on such a happy day. And that behavior doesn't necessarily mean that all is lost, it might just mean you have to further advocate for yourself and further explain things. But if you don't stand up for yourself, nobody will.

I was an egg when my girlfriend initially came out and I am honestly ashamed of how I acted, which I realize now was based on a lot of anxiety about being trans. I had come out to a couple of people in middle school and tried doing minor things to be more non-binary presenting and the response from my peers was to pretty much abandon me completely, and I had tried to convince myself I wasn't trans and could just deal with hating myself and when my girlfriend came out I was like ""geez she hasn't figured out that she can just stuff all of that down inside and hate herself and life will be easier."" But she stood up for herself and was patient and consistent and thoroughly re-cracked my egg. Not that you have to make yourself responsible for everyone who reacts to your transition with their own baggage, but things are complicated and it sounds like you're doing well. I wish you all the best.
I'm sure the mix of emotions are complex and true feelings don't always wind up being compatible, but it sounds like you have a wonderful and loving wife. I hope the two of you can find a way forward together, in happiness.
*clears throat*

Aww that’s literally amazing I’m so happy to you. 

Welcome to the trans with thriving lives club, it’s a wonderful experience
🥳🎉💖✨
The good ending
Yayyyyy!!!!
This is wonderful, I'm so happy for you both!
I'm soooo happy for you!
That is awesome! It's good that she came around. I had a similar situation with my dad where I thought our relationship was over as parent and child but after some time he came around despite that he is still generally an ass. But that is amazing that you guys worked it out before anything was signed and done!
thank u!!! just so excited for the future
my expectations are definitely tempered. I have high hopes, trying to not think negative
oh no 100% agree! i’m taking my time :)
My ex still tells people we split because I'm trans, outing me to anyone and everyone she can.

We got divorced in 2017. I didn't come out and start transitioning until 2019. She's just that much of a fucking asshole. I'm still financially stuck in the same small, rural area she is, so I do still have to see her and the slurs she screams are loud, even for Walmart.
im aware. We both talked about her and mine boundaries. i’m very aware on how slow i’ll be taking this. i don’t want her to ever feel uncomfortable
thank u luv :)
That's going to be a big yikes from me, dawg. It can be very difficult and suck a lot, but you should respect people's sexuality. If I were dating an AFAB person and they turned out to be a trans man, I don't think I could continue the relationship. I'm simply not attracted to men and I don't think anything is going to change that.
That’s not true at all. People can’t control who they’re attracted to. If they’re attracted to men, and their spouse transitions to a woman, they can’t help it if they don’t find them attractive. They’re valid as fuck, as long as they aren’t an asshole about it.
Lol

I went to Planned Parenthood for HRT	I had an appointment today at PPH. When I was called in for my appointment I was greeted by my nurse, a middle aged transgender woman. I’ve been to PPH for appointments a few times before but never was my nurse transgender, and I was so happy to have someone who understood this time around. She was very helpful and gave me many resources. She left me off with, “this is why I do this, so I can take care of us.” I cried after she left the room. It means so much to me as a young transgender male that old trans femme people are looking out for me. Thank you to Dee, my nurse, and thank you to all the trans women, alive or dead, who have made my journey safer.	"I went to PPH for mine too and all my nurses and receptionists were so kind and affirming! Didn't judge me for anything, were so welcoming and called my pharmacy and insurance multiple times when they were being jerks and giving me the run around.
I wish we had planned parenthood in australia.
Planned parenthood made my HRT journey feel so safe and protected. I appreciate them so much, I’m so happy you had a similar experience.
Btw it seems you accidentally posted this twice
Wholesome 🥰
That's wonderful! 

I used to be with PP, unfortunately they don't accept the insurance I get from my work so I had to switch to a LGBTQ clinic, but regardless my doctor was a very sweet lady. Out of all of my appointments I had with them there was only one nurse I had that made me upset. She wasn't transphobic though, it was for another reason. But the receptionist who would pick up the phone was a trans woman, she was a real sweetheart.
The nearest pph to me is an hour away or more but from what I've heard they are my best chance at getting hrt (I'm in a conservative area,  plus the planned parenthood is in a big city that is more liberal) so when I have the funds imma go there even if I have to drive an hour lol
I'm probably gonna go to planned parenthood for hrt when I'm 18, and then my mom will disown me bc she thinks pph is the antichrist (she is HEAVILY prolife) and since she won't get me get as a minor that's the only other option where i live in az, I'd have to drive for hours to get to Phoenix for a good doctor that'd actually prescribe me hormones
I want to be able to say this and do this and that is why Im going into medicine
That's awesome.
I'm on a six-months-ish long waiting list for Planned Parenthood in my large liberal northeastern city, and I'm extremely grateful to them for giving me the hope that I'll actually get it this year. I'll probably have to either lie or just say ""it's none of your business"" if my family asks me where I got it, because my late mother was extremely pro-life and it's kinda rubbed off on some other family members. In any case, the shared goal of bodily autonomy certainly helped deprogram me from the kind of crap I grew up with in an ultra-Catholic household.
Thanks to all of them,  dead or alive, as u said!!!!
i will trust PPH in general more than alot of doctors.
I went to PPH a month ago to start my HRT and I’m so happy I did. Congrats!
This is awesome!  So wholesome.
I'm gonna cry
Me too I’ve only seen negative stuff about PPH but my experience and yours was good so yes this makes me feel so good💙
Just scheduled my first appointment for tomorrow with PP!
I get mine from PPH as well!  I was so glad to be able to easily get the meds which I had at one point thought I'd never be able to get my hands on
This reminds me, I need to make my appointment soon!
I have learned about a lot of what pph does just from looking into it but I had no idea they had trans healthcare I honestly might go there if I can find one since I’d be a lot more comfortable if the cost isn’t prohibitive thank you for the info 💙💜🏳️‍⚧️
I’m going on Monday to start mine!! Yay us! 🥰
PPH is where I went for BC cause my parents didn’t want me on it . They were very kind . PPH is a great resource .
My planned Parenthood provider calls all of her patients like me her children because she cares about us, even my trans partner goes to the same one as me.
Wish PPH was closer to me instead of 4 hours away
Makes me very happy to see so many trans people sharing their experiences and helping each other. Thank you guys!!
I wish I could work at a place like that, to be honest. I feel so isolated in my current job from anything familiar or welcoming, and I feel I have to wear a mask constantly whenever I speak to another person. (A metaphorical mask, not just the medical ones, lol.) I want to have at least a chance to feel I am among my own; and to help and comfort others like me... I have served cis, straight people for a long time and though being closeted is painful, I'm proud of what I accomplished all the same, but I'd like to serve my own community and feel a sense of belonging, at least for a while.
How do you get hrt from pph? Does it cost anything? Do you need the letter from a therapist? Is it available everywhere?
None of the ones anywhere near me offer HRT, so I’m pretty lost rn. Find a therapist that will write letters as fast as she can, but the idea of getting HRT started elsewhere is awful.
Me in Finland understands nothing
 We love you, Dee!!
I had a fairly similar experience. When I went to Planned Parenthood I was a bit surprised when we were going over stuff about transitioning and then the PA answered one of my questions with her personal experience and then I realized she was trans that's why she was working at PP. Then I realized that like half the people working there were trans and I was just kind of surprised that there were so many trans people even in one building, let alone one specific medical center.
I normally hate using this word, but PPH is freaking bae~
What's more important is to follow her example. We didn't get where we are now by leaving our trans and non binary siblings behind.
Warms my heart so much. I love this!!
You spammed this post x3
Question, do they do blood tests as well? How expensive is pph route?
You might be able to do the appointment via telehealth.  That's how my pph appointment works and they are over 2 hours from me.  Much simpler than the traveling back and forth.
Hi there! Question, how much does HRT there cost? And about how long does it take to get? (I’m assuming you need a therapist/doctor note first)
In the future there be more transgender people meeting and greeting use as there are already homosexuals
I've been trying to go to PPH but I'm in a mostly-republican hell-state and all of the ones within reasonable driving distance aren't able to take new patients. They've even disabled the ability to schedule appointments on their website. 😭
I went to pph also mtf
I also got my HRT from PPH! They were so good! Absolutely no judgement and so helpful!
pp was who i went to for hrt and they made the entire process a lot quicker
Dee is an angel 😇
Glad to hear positive PPH stories, and that you are getting positive help!
PP is how I got started too.  They are understaffed where I live so I eventually found a different provider, but I still donate to them and thank them for saving my life.
We are lucky to have all these trans men and women that have taking a larger hit to pave the way for us!
Congrats, yo. <3
This is absolutely beautiful ❤️
I never knew that PPH provided HRT. That’s amazing!!
Planned Parenthood doesn't do it in Indiana for some reason but like regular doctors will sometimes.
thanks for sharing, as a trans masculine person... This story made my heart happy. ALL LOVE, WE MUST LOOK OUT FOR EACHOTHER AT ALL COSTS. <3
Opposite experience for me sadly :( I am still figuring out my gender but know my periods make me extremely dysphoric. They denied me the birth control I’ve been on since 13 because I get migraines and have a slightly increased risk of stroke. I read the statistics and it’s a joke that they blocked my access, the risk is 36.9 women in 100,000 who have migraines with aura and use hormonal birth control have a stroke. I’m way more likely to kill myself from the dysphoria than to have a stroke. I’m going around it and getting the birth control I need online. It’s either that or wanna kill myself so I’m going to do what I need to do 🤷‍♀️ They just said see if this progesterone pill blocks your periods although you’ll probably have spotting and go talk to a gender therapist and wait to see if you can get a hysterectomy or this ablation surgery that stops periods. Thanks, real helpful 😂
So good to hear, I’m glad PPH does gender affirming care, so much more accessible.
It’s funny how America can be so progressive and backwards simultaneously
Hopefully someday!
Or Uk
Or in the European Union
Or Canada
Or Brazil
Thank you <3
Do they offer anything besides hormone therapy? Planned Parenthood is backed up to hell in my state but I was curious for future reference
Oh thank you I didn’t realize
It’s definitely worth it! And I wish you the best of luck, I’m sorry you have to live in an area with less resources.
Hey, if possible look at their website to see if this pp has telehealth for hrt. I got hrt a few months after COVID started and the two pp near me only did telehealth, which helped a lot because I had no transportation at the time. Hope this helps
I drove 2 hours one-way to my first gender-affirming appointment. Absolutely worth the time and fuel.
I’m in a similar situation there so I feel ya mate
They will do online video appointments
According to some other replies, some planned parenthoods can prescribe HRT through telehealth visits
Honestly everything that happened today made me want to as well.
Have you tried scheduling a telehealth appointment? Might get you in sooner
According to some other replies, some planned parenthoods can prescribe HRT through telehealth visits
Go to their website and make an appointment, you can do it in person or telehealth online video appointment. You do not need a letter for PPH but you might for your insurance. It is available everywhere in the US. With my insurance a months worth of estrogen cost me $21 and three months worth of needles was $10
Try scheduling an online telehealth appointment, they do not require a letter
What does this mean?
They do do blood tests. As far as cost it depends on your insurance, I have good insurance, I do injections, a months worth of estrogen costs me $21 and a three month supply of needles was $10
In Washington state (I assume it’s the same for many liberal states) you don’t need a psychiatrists approval to start HRT. When I went in for HRT a year ago I walked out with a prescription my first appointment. Which can be good and bad. Without insurance it can be up to $400 out of pocket. But rarely will you end up paying that much if you have any form of insurance. Just my experience tho.
PPH does not require a note though your insurance might. For me a months worth of estrogen cost me $21 and three months worth of needles cost me $10, that cost will depend on your insurance. I picked up my prescription less than an hour after my appointment
Have you tried scheduling a telehealth online appointment?
Jesus Christ they’re making you jump through hoops, sorry to hear that.
Our political system was basically meant to do that.
Yup, it's the only thing I am jealous of the US of
It depends on the location but only some provide hrt, blood tests for hormone levels, necessary physical examinations depending on your age, etc. They can also provide fairly helpful resources, say phone numbers for trans-friendly therapists or surgeons. 
PP is also moving towards a physical health model (or at least mine is, this was said in context of further examinations ranging beyond sexual health or similar).
Np, happens to me all the time
There might be other options but they would probably not be super familiar with trans people and probably wouldn't be all that nice to go to. I'm in texas if that gives you an idea of how people are around here
I'll remember that but rn I have like 20 bucks in my wallet and I'm in the closet so hrt is a while away for me. I have the potential to have a crazy voice drop cus of genetics so that would be impossible to hide along side me being unable to pay for it
How does PP telehealth work if you don't mind me asking?  Is it mostly an interview followed by a prescription?  Thank you in advance!
I mostly just assume there's that much of a backlog that it's going to take that long in any case. I'm also using the time to lose weight for a hernia operation and because as much as I liked being big, that was deadname's body, and my current self has their own body.
Thank you for the info! I'll definitely look into it.
:D thank you!!
I can't really figure out how. There's not really an option for it on the scheduling system they use.
Oh my gosh pls stay safe. Especially if you’re under 18, the politics are shifting to severely anti trans legislation especially for trans youth in Texas.
That's very fair. I waited until I had moved out because my mom was unsupportive and then just did it anyway. I hope you can get into a spot where you're able to access it. Stay strong
So for me they asked if I was in therapy because I needed to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The nurse basically asked me to explain how I knew I was trans. It was a little uncomfortable I won't lie. Once she was satisfied with my answer, she gave me some resources as well as an informed consent pdf in an email. Then she put me through to the doctor. 
The doctor did some basic health history things with me, and requested that I get my blood work done at LabCorp so they have my base level. She explained changes I might see. Asked for a preferred pharmacy and asked whether or not I wanted to do SubQ or intramuscular. I chose subQ because smaller needles. She informed me that she wanted me to get the prescription and that in a week or two, once she got my blood work, she was going to show me how to inject myself. 

I'm not sure if most PP telehealth works like that, but the Planned Parenthood of Southwest Florida seems to
Good for you!
https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-care/get-care-online
Yeah. I'm almost 21 so I'm alright for now but who knows if they'll fuck with the older trans people too
Yeah I hate it down here because of that
They have no Policy so they're going after the LGBTQ+ community. Stay strong and united. Together we can beat these bigots.
Thank you so much!  I've been debating if/how I want to proceed with this and I do have a PP in my region but it's still a good 1 1/2 drive to see them in person.  What you describe seems like a pretty straightforward process though I have not spoken to a therapist and have not been diagnosed with dysphoria so not sure how that would go.  Scary but also very thankful to have that option available unlike so many others.
We’ll see, time to move to Germany!
I am also in texas, atleast the austin area they are not as bad
From what I've read, Germany is not the place to be at for trans people. It sounds like most of Europe is, ironically, far more frustrating to deal with than the US with the obvious caveat of being a minor in a red family in a red state.
I've heard bigger towns are fine. I'm off in the middle of nowhere in north Texas.  Kinda town where you drive 30 minutes if you wanna go shopping and discrimination and bullying of any kind in school wasn't punished unless a parent threatened to sue the school or if it started a fight where both were punished.
Thanks for the info, I should have thrown out a random place 😅

i came out to my teacher and he thought i was MtF (i am FtM)	"i am actually wheezing and i can't stop laughing. he was so embarrassed but very respectful. quick recap of what happened;

me: i wanted to tell you something personal, i know i don't have to, but you know i have lot of missed classes because of medical stuff. long story short i'm transgender and lot of stuff is happening.

teacher: i appreciate you telling me, i'm happy for you. have you considered transitioning socially, like... do we have to change your name in the future?

me: .......

teacher: .......

me: do you think...... that i'm.... transitioning to a woman?

teacher: ..........

teacher: ......... no?

me: it's okay don't worry, i'm a trans man, i have already socially transitioned and changed all legal thingies long time ago. just wanted to let you know a bit more details why i have been so much out

teacher: right, my apologies

&#x200B;

i guess i have done a pretty good job at my transition?"	"Haha, this happens to me too occasionally! I’m a transwoman. I’m happy I pass that well I suppose 😅
I had that kind of thing happen with a new-hire at work, last year. He figured out  I was transitioning on his own but couldn't figure out if I was MTF or FTM and didn't want to offend me on his first day. I let him sweat it out for the rest of the day before letting him off the hook. It definitely made me feel better about passing and I got a good laugh out of it.
He must be a good teacher if you tell him something so personal - especially if you aparently already pass :D
My favorite interaction with a transphobe is a woman at Walmart saying ""you'll never pass as a man with those childbearing hips""

My tranfem (fat) ass is like ""*gasp* you promise!?!?""

Getting confused for trans in the other direction is a special kind of hilarious and validating x3
This reminds me of my first half-assed attempt at going out femme. Nails painted, neck shaved, eyeliner. Masked. Roll up at McDonald's for a half-cut, hand over my card after girlishly confirming my order. Worker goes ""thank you, have a nice day ma'am!"" And I was so excited I forgot to keep managing my voice and boomed out in my bass-iest ""OH THANK YOU!"" And his face just went ""O_O"" lol

Opposite of your situation OP but I thought funny on a similar level. Hard not to laugh at how ridonk this stuff is sometimes.
In a similar but worse situation, I was talking to a customer at my work about how I was trans and she perked up about her MtF cousin and how she would never guess she was trans because of how well she passes. She then tells me ""Same with you! I would have never guessed you were born a guy.""

I'm FtM :/
That was always fun before I came out. Like I was super androgynous with long hair so when I'd tell people they'd assume I was FTM and had already transitioned and I was like nope MTF and haven't even started. But I'll take the compliment thank you
Is there anything more affirming than someone incorrectly assume what gender you are transitioning to because of how far you come? Cause I've yet to find one
I've been on the other side of that. Met a relative's significant other, knew they were trans, and I for some reason assumed mtf. He was totally cool about it, and a little flattered that I thought he was amab hahaha. But still, awkwaaaard.
This reminds me of how a few people before my transition started in earnest with therapy and now HRT commented how they thought I was AFAB. A nice bit of compliment IMO since my biggest wish after more magic in the world is having been born female instead.
Congratulations, you are circumgender.
that’s a neat experience
Aww poor teacher. Also dang you did a good job transitioning. I’m just starting the process so as I start to come out people know it’s FTM
The opposite happened to me recently... ""I had no idea you're trans! I never would've guessed""
I’ve had this thought before, I’m glad it’s happened to someone before, that’s funny as hell.
Congrats! Oh my god thats fucking hilarious though. I remember I was in a therapeutic setting with a bunch of other teenagers, and they were really confused as to ""what I started out as"". Nothing malicious. It was just really funny to try and explain that I'm MtF to people who thought I started as a girl.
Imagine transitioning so good that people thought you were trying to transition into your original gender. Thats a funny story OP.
Lmao poor teacher. Good on you for giving the teach a second to parse that info there.


And grays on being able to pass that well.
I had a guy be legitimately confused. This was before my transition and since I was blessed with a masculine face, he thought I was *already* a trans girl.
Whohoo! Passing!
A+ on your transition
its a win in my book
My cousin did the exact thing- I was so confused why she thought I was MTF lmao
AHHAHA the same happened to me.. three times. They are a bit confused but they got spirit!
That's how I got outted at work recently.

I was stealth for a year and then when telling a coworker about my surgery that I just had he put dots together but backwards. And asked why I grew a big ass beard when I just removed my dick? (I'm really close with some co-workers and none of us have brain to mouth filters but we mean well) 

So I nearly died laughing while explaining that I'm not going that way.

I'm back at work after stage 1 phallo and found out that he ""accidentally"" let it slip.
My DM took me aside to let me know that the team knew and they went to Dr. Google to learn more... I'm now 2 days back and I'm not even allowed to lift 5lbs or bend over too far because my coworkers are scared I'll split something open. 

1 guy even took the mop and broom away from me today. Lol

I'm all counter/office work till I stop waddling like a duck despite being cleared by my doc for most of my work.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around him thinking that I was mtf...I didn't think I passed that well.
Probably my favourite part of being MtF is the wonderful (no really) graffiti convos and trans support in the handicap stall of my school bathrooms.

As opposed to the loud boys room with genitalia and swear words drawn everywhere.

So far I've gotten no transphobia from the girls here, and they're pretty supportive, or at least don't ask what I'm doing in there. I was able to have a normal-ass convo with a few other girls and no one brought anything up or treated me any differently.

The teachers who've misgendered me always apologized shortly after.

&#x200B;

The first time it happened:

Teacher, taking role: ""\[my name\]""

Me, raising hand: ""Hello.""

Teacher, looking up: ""*\[Name\]*""

Me, inching hand higher: ""*Hello""*

Teacher, annoyed: ""***\[Name\]***""

Me, annoyed: ""***Hello***""

(My name was changed in the school records, she hadn't seen me since the year before)

The next day, she took me aside and apologized profusely, almost in tears.

Apparently people consider me a badass. Huh.
*awkward silence*

""......no??""
I can’t tell you how many times I have had this happen to me
This is a surprisingly euphoric situation! I find it happening most of the time when I tell someone I trans. I guess people just assume that when you openly share that info, they assume you’re early in your transition 😂
Serousy any advice
baha yeah, i knew i was passing but i didn't think i was..... passing *that* good
When one of my coworkers met me before I even fully knew I was trans they thought I was FTM lol.
A few months ago my friend came out as trans to me and i was so surprised, I genuinely thought that he was cis-male
aw man he must have been in pain!
oh yeah he's my man, we're basically mates because punx stick together. he's absolutely a legend, i am studying youth work and that kind of stuff and he believes in the same stuff i do, exp. the importance of punk
Ahahahahaa 😂
aaaaaaa yes!!!! i had an old class mate (completely different school) who yelled ""you will never be a REAL woman!"" 
my trans man ass: *big boy gasp* thank you!

absolutely hilarious and validating!
[deleted]
oh man being trans really adds some spice to social interactions sometimes
That's rough 😬
Oooh oh no
oh maaan that's rough to hear :(
Oh good grief that’s awful.

Also wtf is with cis people thinking that the height of compliments is “I never would have guessed you were born <x>!”

Fuck.
oh man it really does brighten up your day in such weird ways
thats the funny thing about passing. Most cis people don't assume someone to be trans.
Some days ago i was out in girlmode im pre HRT, but i put some effort in my outfit to pass. Then some old lady asked me for the way, and she wasn't even confused, when i answered with my slightly pitched man-voice. She just thought i was a girl with a weird masculine voice...
I thought the same because as i came out and just dressed normally: jeans and a hoodie. people GENDERED ME CORRECTLY \*euphoria\*  however teachers are ""correcting"" themselves which is sad for me D:
Superman does *good*


You’re passing *well*.
Punk fucking rock man I love seeing this kind of shit
We need more ppl like him! :)
A TERF who sees someone with a trans pride necklace and pin apparently

My mom bought them for me. Someone like her could easily have been wearing them. 

She could have easily been harassing a cis woman.
Funny you say that, I spent too much time this morning responding to a transphobe on a dry herb vape subreddit.. spice is a word, lol. Keep on keepin on.
i dunno, man. At least she apologized when I corrected her, but still :/
Holy crap that was fast!
i've had people double correct themselves but also like triple correct themselves.... like ""yes sir, oh no sorry i mean miss.... wait, is it sir?"" which is kinda funny to watch when they are just trying to figure it out
ah yes, thanks for the correction! english is not my native language
We appreciate the idea but not the time my friend
Do you have a link?
haha didn't even notice you commented literally inside the same minute
I HATE THAT-- like if you arent sure just dont call me ma'am or sir please
that's fun. there are also nice people who doesn't even mind it at ALL. some people i work with doesn't even ask about it and just call me by my name(the legal one sadly but that is fine since they aren't bad people) (i worked with them times ago)
My favorite bit of accidental validation comes when I’m arguing some point about transness with a jerk, and they aggressively retort about how I should just be happy with how I was made because no matter what I do I’ll never be a real man...

They assume I’m FTM, when I am in fact MTF. The backpedaling they do when I tell them I’m AMAB is just absolutely priceless
English is really just three different languages in a trench coat that likes to mug other languages for their words.
Many many native speakers say good instead of well in that case as well, although it's technically incorrect. So don't worry about it too much. 

Source: Native english speaker
I’m pretty sure it’s always time to learn.
Yeah. Quick question. What’s it like passing that well? How do you present to people?
yessss, in that situation, just don't refer to me. at all
Yes friend, or enemy? No, friend?
bahah great way to put it
that's good to know as well! thanks
If we ain't learning, we ain't living.
it absolutely feels so great that people just assume i'm male. i present as a guy and people assume i'm cisgender and i just go with it. i don't publicly go around talking about me being trans. i'm pretty much 90% stealth with the people i know
I’m sorry what does this mean
The day I stop being excited to learn is the day the child in me has died. I’m not ready for that yet.
Yeah. I’m stealth with strangers most of the time, but I sometimes get weird looks. Idk. I’m 5’9” have some long ass curly hair, and a decently feminine face. That and I have C cup boobs (forms) so it’s pretty obvious what I’m presenting as. The voice is good too, so I guess I just stick out as a little ugly? Idk.
Oh, it's like the sir or madam thing, but instead with friend or enemy. It comes from a dude who instead of saying ""ladies and gentlemen"" said, ""friends and enemies"" and I just like the idea of someone trying to figure out if you're a friend like they would your gender.
Yes! I was just having this conversation a couple days ago.. learning is a lifelong thing. To stop learning is to start dying."	mct876	trans	2595	0.97	2021-03-25 08:13:55

My friend just came out as trans and I don't know how to support her.	"Just a lil context: My friend ""disappeared"" for about 3-4 months. I thought something happened to her so I started Dm'ing her on discord but she didn't respond. I assumed she was just busy with life since she just graduated and is now going into senior high. Then all of a sudden, I saw a twitter post from her. Basically the post said that she came out as trans (MTF) and has been transitioning ever since she ""disappeared"". I honestly am so proud of her. She posted pic of herself and she looks stunning. I've been meaning to give her a gift since she lives pretty close to my house but I don't knoe what kind. Since this subreddit is filled with trans people, I decided to ask here. What kind of gift I should give her that says ""I'm so proud of you"" but in a subtle way? I thought about giving her a little card that says ""I'm happy for you"" but I want it to be special."	"Flowers. I melted the first time I got flowers because they're ""only given to women."" And a hug. If she likes hugs.
Just give her something you know she'd like, and maybe also look into getting her a pride flag. You can find them for cheap online.
A necklace and a card!

Thank you for being so supportive!
Imho - if they are a friend and you both have the time, I reckon a really nice gift is giving people the time by hanging out etc. Any big life changes can be huge for someone but having friends that are there for you is extra special.
If you two are close at all, better than a gift would be to offer her help finding clothes. If she’s comfortable with the thought of it, offer to go clothes shopping with her. If she’s not comfortable with it now, make it an open offer for when she’s ready.

Gifts can be pretty special but something like this is… bigger. It’s far more helpful long term than flowers or flags. Not that either of those aren’t awesome too.
A screenshot of your title of this.

Properly gendering her from the onset is gift enough!
Blahaj and hug. How many, you ask? Yes.
I wouldn't veer too far from things you already knew she liked, I'm guessing videogames is something lol discord but maybe even a steam card inside of a cute little personal ""I'm proud of you"" card
Moisturizer and serum. Seriously. A lot of us give up on makeup because we apply it on top of dead skin, fine dirt, excess microbes, and dry and/or oily skin, and end up thinking that we lack skills in the end. 

Moisturizer and serum. None of her discord friends are going to help her with this stuff, they would rather see her on a couch with a controller in her hand. Be the friend they need, buy her moisturizer and serum today, and encourage them to wash their face at least once a day forever.
Combing the ideas of a couple commenters here—I really liked the ideas of Lego flowers since she has allergies and the pride flag idea. I’m not sure if the Lego flowers come with a vase but you could assemble them and put them in a jar alongside a mini handheld trans pride flag? That’d definitely show your support of her
This is cute and I want to know how it goes but also it's none of our business so I'll just say I wish you the best and you seem like a good friend 😊

Edit: the ikea shark would be a great and very supportive gift, I second that suggestion
Girls like stuffed animals. Like the shark from IKEA.

Disclosure: I don't work for IKEA.
Flowers are smart, but I would take it a step further. Fake ones. Some ppl have allergies, so setting of her allergies probably not the best idea. There's ppl like me too that loves the look of flowers, but hate real ones. (I'm cool with living plants, just not injuring one for something that will only last a few days)

I love fake flowers. You could even get creative and make her a bouquet of fake flowers. Attach a thoughtful note to it as well. Whether it's just a little name card that says ""From OP"" or something more is up to you. You could even include something like ""You look so much happier now"" or ""it's nice to see the real you"" or something equally corny that will show that you are trying to show your acceptance, not hitting on her.
When one of my best friends transitioned, a gift that really meant a lot to her was her chosen name on a pretty necklace. It gave her something classy and feminine to wear and told her ""This is who you are to me."" all at the same time. It was like a little celebration of who she was. (I wish I could say I thought of this but it was another friend who gave it to her.)

Also, I gave her some dresses from my own collection and actually one from my aunt's closet. (My aunt said, ""Tell her to take this with my blessing."") Women swap clothes a lot more than men and it was like a ""welcome to the sisterhood."" Her eyes lit up when I told her she should be looking through my purses before going shopping for one. ""We do that?"" Yes we do my dear.
Offer to go thrift shopping with her. Make it a girls’ day out. Treat her to her favorite coffee drink or something 

Buying gender affirming clothes and having her name on her cup :))

I was smiling so big the first time I had my new name written on my order
Hi. A lot of good ideas in here. Mine:

Chokers that cover your adams apple (the wider ones).

That is all. Take care. And you are a lovely human being.
Eyeliner. Lots of colors. Or even just black. But no lots of colors.
Just be by her side and that will be the best gift u can give her
Say something like ""I'm so proud of you!"" and gift her like feminine clothes and eyeliner or something.
You could even take her out to lunch or something just spend time together
I’d reckon asking her what kinds of clothes she likes and going with her to pick things out would be pretty rad! Finding things she likes and maybe buying some are best bc then there won’t be any size mix ups or things she doesn’t feel super comfortable with. I’d extend an offer 🖤
well your already using her preferred pronouns so you're basically half way there lmao
It's so nice that you've reached out and asked, there are so many good recommendations so I won't suggest anymore. The number one thing you can do is treat her like any other girl, but it really sounds like you're not going to have an issue with that 😊
Subtle gifts such as their favorite candy, snacks and transitioning diary with photo inserts (useful for jotting down thoughts and keeping track of medications with progress photos). In addition there are gifts such clothes and accessories (claires or hot topic) that match their personality or friendship bracelet, locket or charm. Personally I'd love to get jewelery or clothes that scream me. Lol
Well, thanks for making me cry. I agree with the flowers. I’ve never gotten flowers before and I think I would die on the spot if someone brought me some. I also would recommend just telling her she looks pretty <3
TAKE HER SHOPPING!!!
A butterfree stuffed pokemon is a cool idea.
When my trans gf came out to her daughter, her daughter opened her jewelry box and told her to feel free to take whatever she wanted.
You can give her a jar of pickles (unironically) accompanying a gift. If she has been transitioning, the estrogen takes a lot of salt, making trans women really craving sakty foods, and pickles are one of them.
Get her a blahaj...
Something that is commonly given to girls I think would be super gender-affirming, such as flowers (I saw someone suggest lego flowers!) chocolates, maybe a nice necklace with her chosen name is she has one, just cute stuff haha
All the below answers are great. I'd like to add, take her shopping!!! Or treat her to dinner :-) that's always appreciated and I'm sure it'd be a great way for you both to catch up.
I don’t have any ideas but I do wanna say you’re a really great friend for coming here to ask for advice. Most people who wouldn’t go to the trouble. I’m proud of both you and your friend :)
Though flowers will be lovely, just let her know that your still her friend no matter what.
how about a friendship/besties necklace? I'm talking those that connect and form a heart or a flower when both are placed next to one another! it's a fun little gift that girl besties usually give eachother.
You could put together a cute spa kit for her. Face mask, hair mask, nail polish, pedicure kit, bath bombs. Couple it with a card that has the ""thinking of you"" motif or congratulations. On Etsy, there's folks that make ""Congrats on coming out"" style cards. 

Basically, treat her like you would any other woman in your life who is celebrating a milestone.
Flowers or maybe a necklace with the trans colours?
I don't know, a card like that would be enough to melt my heart tbh
My fiancé was having a bad day, out of the blue I bought her a bunch of flowers, nothing expensive just a standard bunch of store flowers, she was so happy with them she said it felt right to receive them, maybe try that because socially women are given flowers.
Hmm, how about a gift card to something like American eagle or Express, maybe to a make up place like Sephora? 

A little desk-plaque name thing with their name after a “Ms.”? I don’t know if they’ve got any interest or have changed their name, but a name plate with a gender-affirming name would be really nice. 

A cute mug - something with flowers or subtly feminine? 

And always, a hug w/ telling them that you love them and you’re happy for them.
All the gift ideas have been lovely! So all I'll say is if you're comfortable, update us if it went well!
Nail polish in fun colors, some cute jewelry that’s not too expensive and can go with anything, hair ties, that sort of thing. Maybe some makeup like eyeliner or lipstick. And go with the card. All suggestions.
If you want to support her;

1. Ask her her real name/pronouns. My bestie and I are the ones who found mine

2. Offer to go w her to doctor/endo visits. This was HUGE for me. I waited 28 years and was still a little scared

3. If possible, offer her a place to crash/stay. Housing is tough for us to find - esp if we’ve been kicked out by ‘family’

4. Just talk w her. This, many times, means as much as everything else

…. And lego flowers sounds cute af…
Get her a skirt, and this is the most important part, it has to go spinny /hj
Just give her a Blåhaj and a copy of New Vegas
Feminine jewelry, even if it’s just inexpensive stuff, can be a very affirming gift.  My wife often gets or makes (she’s a crafty sort) me pieces and honestly, it’s sweet and affirming every time.  Flowers (artificial if she’s got allergies like I do) are nice but jewelry makes a nice keepsake.  Depending on her fashion sense, a silk scarf can be lovely too.
Flowers! If she's allergic, you could get her those plastic flowers in stores that look really real. Thats what my sister did for a teacher that's allergic to flowers. Or her fav food/ fav stuffed animal (if she likes that stuff)
You can find some good looking flowers at Michael's (a craft store) idk if they have Michael's where you live, but other craft stores, or even dollar tree should have some
she's lucky to have a friend like u ! keep being an amazing person <3
Maybe something traditionaly feminine? Like makeup,nail polish or like a dress? Idk im FTNB so i dont know much about MTF gifts ('._.)
You are a good friend
Respect her pronouns, call her by her preferred name, correct people if she's out to them, just be her friend
Maybe a gift card to a store that has pretty clothes? :)
You are what restored my faith in humans today.
I would always recommend searching for “trans gifts” on Etsy! You could absolutely find something really cute even just w the trans colors if you weren’t wanting it to be a “HEY LOOK AT ME I’M NOT CIS” kinda deal
A lil trans flag would be cool!
A hand held one, or a cape style one(?) Would be good. Or if your in a safe era (IE not in like the American deep south or something), a trans flag pin?
Honestly literally anything, making your support clear will mean more than anything
Give her a nice accessory (which would say to her “I support and see you as a woman”) a handwritten card ( “I hand wrote this because it’s important and a store bought card is lame”) and a hug. After that, let her bring it up on her own. Don’t make a big deal out of it, treat her like a normal human being. That’s all we ask 💕 /lh ((:
Lots of great advice here.
My ex gave me a hair clip, only girls rlly wear them epicaly the cute one she gave me was feminine indeed and then my current bought me my first purse, or maybe you could do a wallet, I'd say go with the wallet, I still don't have one and I want one so bad and I'm sure she does too! You know her better than me and theres plenty comments to choose from
Etsy do some awesome trans coming out cards, maybe you could send her a card, with a clothing voucher in?
A dress or jewelry maybe?
you caould get her the estrogen neclace? idk from where, i have seen on insta
Maybe some trans merch of some kind? Or like a pronoun pin! I would love that
Give her a card with an offer to go clothes/makeup/something shopping with her
idk if it's too late for you to do this but I'd just reply to the tweet with ""I'm proud of you"" or something supportive yaknow?
When a friend came out i made them a trans pride flag out of snacks XD 
Part of that was 2 blue lemonades, 2 pink lemonades, and a regular lemonade. Simple gas station gift basically but they appreciated it
(Friend was not out to family so had to be subtle)
Coming from a trans woman I’d personally love any gift no matter how big Or small it’s the thought that counts
Just keep being her friend. Be supportive and let her be her. That's what I would do.
I'm broke can't give wholesome award (and I'm terrible at gift giving) but I want to give wholesome award
Hi! Lil update on the gifts.  


I couldn't buy the blahaj shark plushie but I bought shark hats. TWO OF EM.  
I also couldn't buy the lego flowers so I resorted to fake ones (hope she'll like em)   
Our scheds our pretty cramped so I couldn't take her out clothes shopping. So I decided to buy her a skirt and sweater instead.   


She loved the gifts! Thank you so much for the suggestions!  
wish I could post pictures, but all of the pics I took have my friend in it and she doesn't want it posted (even when I scribbled her face out)  
Again, Thank you all for the suggestions!
Lend her your time and ear. Give her a place to be herself. Oh and Maybe change your Reddit name to start.
You can look on etsy for ""trans pride plush toy"" or DND dice. It says you know in a blunt but nice way.
If she is into self care, maybe get a couple gift certificates to her favourite salon for you two to get pedicures together? Just my thought.
Give something with the flag!! Like a bracelet or something, im sure she will love it!
I’d say stuffed animals (for me, I love every kind. But I do also have some from Etsy that are specifically for pride) and if you know her type, her new name+pronoun and the flag. I’ve seen good options on Etsy and they’re super cute! They were perfect for me who is fluid but also trans (if it makes sense lol) coz it’s not too masc or fem either!
Just google
Some flowers with a little trans pride flag and maybe some chocolates if she likes them. Treat her like you would treat a queen.
my bff got me some pride earrings and they mean the world to me, but honestly just letting her know you support her by just visiting would be amazing!
If you know her style well enough, can’t go wrong with a cute top or something. Also, skirts are really great if your trans, due to the way they make your butt look.
This is so adorable omg. Maybe something like some feminine jewelry or a headband or something that’ll make her feel pretty.
Since she's allergic to flowers,  maybe a teddy? 
Pretty much only girls get stuffed animals as presents.
Could get a Blahaj :3
I love the Lego flowers! But also an option, a handpicked basket of girl stuff. Thoughtful things like good yummy smelling deodorant, lip glosses,manicure items. Doesn't have to be a lot of money,just pick some thoughtful female specific things
my best tip is to match her energy when she tells you!! if she’s nonchalant, be the same way back! say “i’m happy for you” or something similar. if she acts super excited, then do that too!! someone offered me this advice once and it helped me out a lot :}
Do you want it to be special because you have a little crush going on now ?🙃 get her flowers and something that says it’s a girl and just a note of your feelings whether it’s just being proud or something more deep
You could make a card out of watercolor paper, fold it in half & paint something cute like a sunrise or butterfly on the front, put a Ulta [makeup store] gift card inside & write a simple message of support & love for your friend
You could get her a skirt, that's what my friend did when I came out to her and it meant the absolute world to me
You are a wonderful friend.  I love the Lego flower idea and agree that it would be nice to give her something that leans traditionally more feminine as a way to celebrate her transition.  However, you could always consider a book honoring trans pioneers or something similar along with a nice tin of tea.
Do a girls night out with stuff she likes and just have fun
Make up wouls make me happy 


Or maybe suprise her by asking her to go shopping with u and help u buy a gift for someone else and tell her its a cis girl or something and u need her help
(But its really for her)


I did this to my younger cis sister (she loves basketball and we say a game live together and i was like i wanna get this jersey but idk whos good at basketball (teams and players) (honestly i dont watch aus basketball lol)  then i made her try it on and it fit and she looked happy and i bought it 


Fast forward 3 months she has no idea she bought her own birthday present lol





If it were me i would do something like make up or try to suprise them like that
You can give her this sentence but write it in the colors of the trans pride flag.


Sentence: “I am proud of you!” 
:)
She likes hugs but she has allergies
Yah the flowers I got from so many people after I publicly came out meant so much to me. They were probably the most special ones I’ll ever get and I still have the cards that came with them on my fridge.
My wife is transitioning and feeling like shit from dysphoria atm. Maybe I send her some flowers to work to cheer her up...

Thanks for the idea
Good idea. Didn't think of that. Definitely going to be buying one of em
But it's very possible that she already has one
A necklace sounds nice but i don't think she like jewelry. Might give it a try tho!
If our scheds are clear, i could give her gifts AND hang out with her.
Definitely would ask her to go clothes shopping with her once she gets free time. we haven't gone to the mall in a while so I think she'll like it
I came here to say this.
If she saw this, she would freak out and go to my house to smack me.
Edit:

Properly...  Not property.

Sorry.  Fixed.
two blahajs (one for me and for her) hugs? at least 20
Might buy her minecraft someday so we could play. Thanks for the idea
Ooh maybe even get a game for both of you that you can play together to reconnect after her brief hiatus 😊
Noted. Thanks for the idea!
Or make a Lego vase in the pride flag’s colours to hold the flowers
You work for IKEA don't you
Ah, so whatever egg_irl posts on Twitter is true. Girls do like sharks
Awww, that is so sweet. I love it. <3
Don't know if she's into makeup but I could ask her
If our schedules clear up, I would definitely take her out
Why butterfree? What is butterfree?
I’m crying that’s so beautiful
definitely would take her out IF our scheds clear up
Hmmm. I might consider buying her stuff like that. Thing is, I don't know if she likes makeup or not. A dress? she would love that.

something like this
what wrong with my name :(
i'm planning to buy the ikea shark for her
I'll keep this in mind once I ask her to go shopping with me! thanks!
I plan on buying her the actual flag but I might throw in a little ring with the flag on it.
Depending on how much you planned to spend LEGO flowers are beautiful and fun and last for ever.
Get her a mfing fruit bouquet
Allergies to hugs?
Succulents?

Everybody loves succulents.
Lego flowers!
Fake flowers might be best! they last longer and maybe you could make them the colors of the trans pride flag?
my mom has really bad allergies/hayfever but arranged flowers don't bother her. I think it's probably from the pollen not really moving from the flowers into the air
if you think she will still flare up with any flowers, a bouquet of her favorite candies would be lovely
or a nice greeting card with a handwritten message of love and support would very likely be great
Well don’t rub the flowers in her face then
Fake plant?
Have you asked her what helps with her dysphoria? I would definitely love flowers. But my favorite thing is being held and having my back rubbed. It lets me just relax and forget everything.
A sticker trans flag is always a safe bet as well, if you're worried about her already having a flag
Can't have too many trans flags
*looks at picrew*

Hey not because I'm transfem I like chokers. I mean, I like chokers. But not because im trans
most tgirls like chokers, a simple one will do the trick
Sounds good! but inho hanging out trumps gifts but you know your friend better obvs :D

The fact you are thinking of her is also really special.
Sounds perfect!
That would be wonderful. I think it would also bring the two of you a lot closer. Similar experiences for me have certainly done so with those I shared them with.
This is what made the biggest difference for me. I was terrified to shop for clothes by myself. Tried buying clothes through Amazon but that was a fucking disaster. So many purchases and returns.

My friend invited me up to her house for a weekend and we spent most of it going through her clothes and picking out outfits. Miraculously, all of her old clothes fit me perfectly. Once the fall weather arrives, she’s bringing me out shopping for fall and winter clothes.
Well, I can't speak for her because we're two different people.  But if it were me, your whole post shows a very genuine sincerity of support!
*At least* 20, yes! 🤗
Of course! The worry is, you don't want to make her uncomfortable by going too strong with a girly type gift though I agree, flowers would be sweet, just don't go crazy with like a massive bouquet lol don't wanna cause a scene
minecraft is objectively the best gift to give someone
mate minecraft?!.... wish i had friends like ya
It's the Ikea Blåhaj. 
https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/blahaj-soft-toy-shark-90373590/
I love it. The shark from ikea is a great idea or [this.](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ingabritta-throw-pale-pink-70374067/?gbraid=0AAAAAD27g7yOw7rBe4L-N7ALAT3ozyCbv&gclid=Cj0KCQjwuuKXBhCRARIsAC-gM0iFVH2rJblgoZ6LUWwtSFaADETOKp9PFDTn1OCL-V7-uwrlX5mogAkaAiY7EALw_wcB)
Sharks are the bomb. That's a winner.
lego flowers sounds like a good idea
The lego flower sets are amazing! I have the Bird of Paradise set and it actually moves a little like a real plant when there's a breeze.

OP you could totally build the set with her too and catch up on things, might make for a fun way to reconnect :)
Omg. This would make me melt
As someone with ASD I'm gonna steal this
Allergies to plants I'm assuming from context
My first thought 😆😆😆
Not how pollen allergies work, just having them in the same room is bad
I ask regularly if there's anything I can help with but I'm always getting a ""no"" or ""I don't know"". She still looks... Masculine at the minute, only recently came out properly to people. I've given her some of my old clothes from when I was skinny (she fits in my favourite jeans and I'm very envious of her) and I'm regularly suggesting styles and clothes that might suit her with the masculine figure, but it's a slow process and she's very impatient. I want to help and make her feel more feminine (I'm cis f) however I'm not the girlie's of girls, but I'm frightened a little bit that she will out girl me one day. 

She de-haired tonight which I think made her feel better, but we have a heatwave in the UK atm, so we agree on 0 touching until its passed (both of us don't do well in the heat and get very uncomfortable very quickly).

She has lots of support at work, and I think she's just... Tired (she's on day 7 of 10 days in a row at the minute) and I don't quite know what to do to help, so maybe flowers are a good idea, and shows her off at work a bit.
Fair
Don’t call me out like that 😂
hey dont call me out like that
A true statement proves it’self lol
Why am I such a stereotypical transgirl wtf lol.
Not a tgirl, but don't call me out like that either 😂
Guilty…

I never thought that would be me - pre-transition I HATED anything even near my throat, to the point I’d freak out. Add E and I was shocked the first time I put one on and not only didn’t freak out but liked what I saw. Guess there’s a side of me ripe for exploring.
Hey fellow ace! We both know how much we love hugs
And then giving Minecraft along w it kind of reassures that you're still her friend and just really proud, you're not going to try to be more now that she's a girl or go after her you're just trying to show her you're happy and accept who she is no matter what ☺️
ill buy one for her and for myself
And crocheted flowers!
another vote for lego flowers (or the succulents)

you could also get an Eternal Rose (they are encased and last about 1 year \[e.g. [Rainbow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/100-Real-Rose-That-Lasts/dp/B07RPJMLT6)\]
weld a flower if yoi can. or buy one of them plastic ones they have at ikea
Or origami ones!
They can get a bit pricey but you could do a bouquet of silk flowers with a heartfelt card in and since the flowers would last forever it would be a permanent reminder that she's supported ❤️
As a LEGO fan who’s bought every set of the botanical sets, yes! They’re very pretty, they give you a nice relaxing building time, and they’re allergy friendly!
You cold get Lego flowers with the trans colors!
Seriously they’re amazing, I have the banzai tree and it looks as good as it did the day I built it, defo a great idea -I might get a set for my trans partner-
Question: do you assemble the Lego’s or do you give them the box lol
This is such a great idea, I would love it!
Big same 😆
Yeah, I was kidding lol
I know I’m allergic to pollen, I was just being *not* funny apparently lol
Sometimes it's hard to say what'll make us feel better, and that's ok.  

Some other ideas are just gender affirming things. Think about taking her shopping for women's clothes. Or to a spa for a massage or a salon for a mani/pedi.  

If you're both too busy to go out, maybe just make her a nice dinner and have some wine together.   

I know it means a lot to me to just be seen and heard, too. Dysphoria is hard, so there's no one right answer honestly.   

On the note of ""out-girling"" you, I've already done that to my wife lol. I learned how to do makeup better than her and bought a ton of it and wear it all the time, so I taught her how to do hers. I wear crop tops and tanks that she would never touch and keep my nails painted constantly. She laughs because she's so uninterested in most of that stuff, but she's so sweet. She loves how confident I've become.   

It sounds like you're a really good wife. It's really kind of you to care so much.
joining in here, cuddles are the best thing ever
THIS
Even better if you learn how to crochet specifically for this.
Personally I love making origami flowers. Simple ones cause I only do it occasionally, but it's something meaningful that can last, but not so time consuming that they won't feel bad if they throw them out
Ah ok. I thought the original wording might have been confusing and genuinely wanted to help
Ah, that makes sense. I might be an outlier missing the joke, I'm autistic, but if you wanna make sure next time, tone indicators are a great tool, ""/jk"" at the end of the paragraph when you're joking is really helpful when people can't see your face or hear your voice.
I am trying to be positive with the out-girling, as I am expecting to learn new things (I taught myself how to do my makeup and have pretty much been doing the same thing since I was a teenager) and I understand that it might need some more research and a little more effort to feel feminine. I don't really look after myself that much so it might also give me a push to start putting on makeup a bit more, doing nails and hair, skincare routines etc. just generally being a little more aesthetically pleasing.

She usually wants to be alone when she feels like this, so I leave her be, ask her if she wants anything, and if not, just give her the space she needs to process her feelings.

Her 5 o clock shadow is also really dark, which I think is causing her issues, so we're researching together how we can tackle that.

I am supportive, but my initial reactions weren't optimal (that's a whole other story) and it's taken her a year to decide that she wants to transition properly. After researching about the process, mentality, how she feels, and joining a couple of reddit communities (r/mypartneristrans has been an absolute godsend) I've realised that it doesn't matter and I still want to be with my person. And who wants to conform to social norms anyway?!

My mentality is that this will be a journey,  and when we look back on where she was, to where she is in the future, I feel it'll be worth it. Nothing good is ever easy.

I Just want to help her feel a bit better about herself and that I'm okay with her transition, and that I'm ready to do this with her.
Especially since I'm allergic enough to certain perfumes that people can't hug me while wearing them.
I'm going to reiterate it: you're a wonderful partner. You sound just like my wife.   

Some of this journey will be hard. But it's also an exciting one. Enjoy it together. It's an experience few people get the pleasure of experiencing.
If she's been unhappy for a long time, you're going to notice a huge difference and it'll definitely be worth it. My sibling was *constantly* grumpy until he came out in his teens and since then his mental health has really only gotten better as he transitioned. Looking back, he *definitely* frequently felt humiliated which made him irritable with us- exactly what you'd see with any cis boy looking feminine and being stereotyped by it against his will. Recognising that you're trans is one part of the journey but systematically tackling dysphoria and feeling the changes and healing from the humiliation all takes time.
Those ones where they leave the smell on you- Aunt Gertrude, I'm looking at you."	wo6iyx	trans	2547	0.94	2022-08-14 13:33:43
UPDATE: My partner IS trans! Thank you for helping me support her!	"POSSIBLE TRIGGERS: difficulty accepting their own identity 

I’m definitely not crying with joy, lol! /s

Things happened a lot quicker than I expected! She is still questioning her gender, but trust has already been established and I’m glad to say she feels good about coming out!

Well, after reading your helpful comments, I decided it was time to shower my partner with love and acceptance, and I had a plan to make her feel safe. I cosplay for fun sometimes, so I invited her to help me with one of my cosplays. I was going for Emily from Stardew Valley (a perfect QUEEN, just saying), so I had a blue wig already with me. She LOVES blue hair.

After she arrived, I said I could do her makeup after I did mine if she wanted. She hesitated, but she very timidly asked “can I try your wig instead?” and, of course, I said yes and helped her put on the wig. Not gonna lie, blue hair fits her perfectly! I have the prettiest girlfriend in the world! She looked at the mirror and smiled… her smile is so cute (yeah, I’m cheesy as hell, sorry not sorry)!

We spent the rest of the afternoon/early evening watching a cooking show we love and cuddling. She was still wearing makeup and the wig. Then, I showed her [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/egg_irl/comments/ntogxm/eggirl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) meme I found while browsing the r/egg_irl sub. She laughed hysterically and just said the softest “yeah”, and covered her face, because she was getting pretty red. Then, I said what almost all of you told me she would love for me to say.

“You know I’ll still love you if you’re trans, right?”

Tears started to show on her eyes, but she shook her head and said “‘nah, I’m cis, I wish I was born a girl, but I’m a guy, there’s nothing I can do about it”. I hugged her and said that her gender assigned at birth doesn’t matter at all to me, and she shouldn’t be ashamed of being who she is. Then, in a very low voice, she said:

“I think I might be a girl then… maybe… I don’t know”

I reassured her again that I would be with her no matter what, and that I would be by her side on her journey of self-discovery. She said she wants to try using she/her pronouns, but just when the two of us are alone. I’m happy she’s finally letting her find herself. 

Thank you so much for all the help! I’m sure, when she’s ready, she will feel loved in this amazing community. 
Makeup tips would be appreciated, lol!"	"My heart can’t handle all this sweetness 😭 You are legit partner goals.
This is so sweet.  Some of us need a bit of a push at times because we have internalized a lot of self-hate and shame.  Not that I know from experience or anything………
I am literally crying 😭 she is so lucky to have a partner like you!
That's so wholesome, I was going to bed and I said to myself ""let'a check one or two posts before bed"" and now i'll go sleeping with a big smile because you're so cute, I wish to your girlfriend a transition without majors problems ❤❤❤
I'm smiling so much from reading this.  This so is precious.  I keep rereading all the cute lines because of how amazing they are.  You're amazing OP!  I love how much you're there to support her.  I'm so glad she feels safe and is discovering herself.  I feel so happy for her!


Also makeup tips: I'm no expert.  There are some really good tutorials on YouTube. Samantha Lux has some good tutorials.

The biggest thing is trying to enhance your cheekbones imo.  Shadow (contouring) around places can make areas look smaller so can be nice on the side of the nose and face as well as under the jawline.  Some on the underside of the cheekbones with highlights on top. 

Eyeliner is also huge.  Just changing eyes can be huge.

If facial hair shadow is a thing like for me.  Laser will help, but until it kicks in some concealer and a color corrector can help.  A bit of orange can help.

A lot will depend on face shape.  A lot of amab have a longer distance between bottom of nose and upper lip.  At least I do.  You can try to add a bit extra lipstick on top or go for a more neutral or nude color to draw less attention to the lips.

Wigs help a ton.  They add so much to face shape.  You may not think you look great, and then bam throw on a wig and your makeup WAS fine. 


I think the last thing is just tell her to be patient.  Makeup takes time to get good at.  I still struggle with eyeliner.  The important thing is to have fun doing it.


I wish you two the best.  You're amazing OP!
Omg omg omg I want a partner like you. This is so wholesome
I wish my ex partner was like you when I came out 🙂
I'm not crying, my eyes are just leaking.

It was so amazing of you to treat her so kindly and make sure she knows that you love and respect her. It makes me so happy to know people like you exist.

You handled that even better than a lot of trans people, including myself, would. She's really lucky to have someone as sweet as you by her side, and I really hope for the best for you two. :)
This is such a wonderful update!! You are the sweetest partner and remind me of my partner.


Fwiw, after checking out your profile and seeing another of your posts, I can say that past me related very much to your gf with not wanting intercourse for ""reasons."" Fast forward through time and therapy and learning more and the real root of the reason wasn't insecurity about size but rather that being the penetrative partner didn't feel natural or right to me, so my subconscious came up with different reasons for not wanting to engage in that role. Of course she might be totally different from me, but I wanted to share some perspective that may help down the line!
Awwwwww. gosh. I am so happy for you both congratsss!!!!!!!!!!!!!  


You're the best!!! :)  
I'm tearing up over here :"")
omg im crying this is so sweet!!
This is such a great thing to read! I wish you both the best in this journey!
Huggles for being your awesome self and celebrating this moment in both your lives!
Your so sweet!! I loved reading this!
Wholesome.......OVERLOAD!
>Makeup tips would be appreciated, lol!

...you called? 

I'd be genuinely happy to help! Reach out to me anytime (or ask questions here if you'd rather) and I'll help as best I can!
Was not expecting to cry when I casually opened up Reddit tonight but here we are. I'm so happy for both of you! \^\_\^,
aww i love this so much!! i’m not crying either no definitely not 🥲
Wow, the emotions this makes me feel! Just wow!
Awwwwwwww

This is so incredibly heart-meltingly sweet. I'm so happy for you both!
This is such a beautiful story! Thank you for sharing this!

You’re an amazing partner, and she is so lucky to have you in her life!
I'm crying because of how sweet this is and how amazing you are. To care that much to watch her emotions and put her first is just so heartwarming. I love it! I wish the best for both of you as you go through what is just the beginning of a journey.
Fyi for future posts, there is actually a ""possible trigger"" flair iydk
It took me weeks to just say I wanted to be a woman due to the internalized transphobia and shame. Which is odd because i've never had the slightest issue with other trans people, but it really was one of those kneejerk ""everyone is valid except for me"" sort of feelings. Hell for a while I could only say that i wanted to transition from being a guy to ""the other one"" because admitting I was a woman was sooo difficult.

It sounds like your support is helping your girlfriend make progress at a phenomenal rate, and you really deserve a pat on the back for your support.
My heart! One of the biggest factors of being able to finally come out and embrace my gender is because my partner has provided safety, honesty and support during this journey. I’m so glad you can do that for your partner too!!!
Your partner is very lucky to have such a supportive and loving person in her life.
This is SO WONDERFUL! You are an amazing partner <3
Love Love Love it
This is the most wholesome shit ever 😭
This is so cute and wholesome!

Your gf is really lucky to have your as their partner!
Crying on a Thursday morning, I'm so glad you're there for her and that the blue wig was a success.
The world needs more lovely people like you 😘
Awwwww, my goodness, it's so dusty in here all of a sudden.
you are amazing, you both are, this is soo  sweet <3
IT'S TOO CUTE SEND HELP
She's very lucky to have a partner who accepts her and went to look for understanding like you did.  It's nice to see the dream scenario 😌.
I'm gonna melt, this is so cute and wholesome! Wish I had gotten that type of response from my STBX (would have made things much less lonely), but that relationship ending was for the best for both of us on many levels.

Glad to hear things went so well, and best wishes to both of you!
I have had a migraine for the last three days. My mood was crap, I'm tired and cranky.

And now I'm crying happy tears because this shit is so beautiful and I love it so much, like damn.

You two are an amazing couple and I hope you stay in love and happy together for a long, long time <3
I want a partner like you your awesome
OP, you're an amazing partner! I'm glad you helped give your partners egg a little tap to show you love her. As a trans girl myself, I can say for certain, awesome partners like you make a huge difference in our lives. Keep being supportive and I'm super glad you helped her out! :)
You are a great partner and very kind
This is so wholesome… who’s cutting onions? 🥺😭
This is one of the best things I've seen all day
My...heart...

I'm so happy for you guys!!! I hope you both have a wonderful time together with this new discovery. ^^
This is such a beautiful story. My partner is having trouble figuring out how to support me being trans. I wish they would reach out like this and support me like you are for your partner. I couldn't love your post more
ahhh! so cute!
This is the most beautiful thing I've read in a while 💜 😭
This is cute
You’re based AF! That’s some partner goals right there!
Nawwwwww. All the 💜
This made me cry at the train station, thank you ❤️
Well I reading this was like a big hug in the morning she's lucky to have somebody like you
This is so incredibly sweet, I'm just sitting here, crying from reading this. She can be very happy to have you in her life, I think you handled it very very well and it sounds like she trusts you a lot considering she generally has trouble talking about emotions and stuff like that. Congratulations on her starting the way of discovering and accepting her true self and on you for having an incredibly cute sounding girlfriend! I wish you guys all the best on this journey 💖
Now I'm getting choked up.. this is so beautiful to read. Nothing in the world makes me happier then to see someone discover their true gender identity. I'm so happy for your girlfriend and you!!!
My fucking heart. Omg this is so sweet and loving its perfect.

I know your gonna hear this a lot but you are an amazing love filled person and this post gives me the most hope I've ever had 💕

All the best to the two of you
I'll read this again and cry later when I'm not in the middle of the office. I'm so happy for both of you!
I am NOT crying ok?
Right out of a movie 🥲☺️
That sounds so sweet and cute! I'm happy for both of you \^\^ 

I wish my girlfriend was that supportive for my being mtf instead of just accepting, I've felt quite jealous \^\^' 

Congratulations and good luck girls!
This is the best and most wholesome thing I’ve ever read bar none ❤️🙏🎊
This is amazing!
Please excuse me, I believe someone is cutting onions in here.
Honest to god you are so teethrottingly sweet I can almost hear my dentist cry.
I admire you greatly and I wish we all had someone like you there for us.
Love and support from the Netherlands!
I'm tearing up at work reading this. You are the partner everybody needs. You are a beautiful, wonderful person. I hope life takes you two to incredible places <3 congrats to you and your partner! :)
This both warms and breaks my heart...I'm happy for the both of you! You are awesome! The world needs more of you! 🥰❤️
OMG, All the feels right here!
This is the most beautiful thing I've read in a looooong time. 🖤🖤🖤
“Feels targeted. Shot fired. Target has been hit right in the feels.”
Yayyy congrats! Stardew Valley is so perfect, and so are you two. Hope your love will continue to grow 💖🥺😍❤️💖
Omg I would have cried if I didn't have this annoying testosterone in my body. So heartwarming! (｡♡‿♡｡)

""I might be a girl then... Maybe... I don't know""
I feel this so hard xD, but I think I'd rather go in that direction than stay how I am.

I hope you and your girlfriend have a wonderful time together and she's very happy to have such a wonderful, caring and loving person like you <3.
OMG, this is so sweet and touching... You and your girlfriend seem to be totally cute and wholesome! Great you could talk even though it took some time for her to really open up. (I mean, that's absolutely understandable! I've also looked at your other post from before, and regarding her backstory, it's no wonder she supressed those feelings and thoughts for such a long time...)

I wish you two the best but I'm sure it will all get better now with all your loving and support. <3 (Sorry if anything sounded strange, I'm German, haha.)
I was already having a teary day, and now I'm ugly crying after reading to the end. Congratulations to both of you, and especially her! Thank you for being so patient and letting her get to her feelings while making her feel safe enough with you to do so. You are a good human 💙
i think you're single-handedly causing the entire sub to cry tears of joy....i'm in bio class rn and im tearing up and i **rarely** cry
Awesomeness!!! ❤️
OMG!! I'm not crying! So sweet!
I really envy her such a supportive partner
You are amazing! Every person should strive to be as supportive and loving as you are. I wish you two a long life of happiness and many years together. I hope one day I can find someone who'll accept and love me no matter what I choose with my body
This literally made my day! I saw your initial post and I'm sooo happy for you both. The world needs more of your kind heartedness, love, and acceptance. 

DM me, seriously, for makeup help. I have watched enough YouTube about it and specifically things for trans women that I feel like I should have an honorary cosmetology license. 

Love and happiness to you both 💜
This is so heart meltingly sweet, you're doing a fantastic job for her. For you both. This is a scary time for her but so exciting too. If you ever need more specific info down the line we're happy to give it.
That is so adorable! I’m glad that while she hasn’t exactly answered her question of who she is that she has someone as supportive as you are to help het in her journey though! It’s a long road, and a difficult one at times with lots of ups and downs.
I literally crying right now!! You and your partner sound so sweet!! Your partner is so lucky, I'm so happy for you both 🥺😭
I'm not crying you're crying
As far as makeup tips, if she has to deal with covering beard shadow you're going to want orange color corrector. I used to use one that came in a pen that worked pretty well but I went through them very quickly since I was using like a hundred times would a cis woman would use lol. Until I had laser hair removal and didn't need to cover beard shadow, I'd put down a layer of the orange color corrector, put that under a layer of concealer, and then put foundation over the top of it all
You're such a great person ❤️
This makes my heart so happy. Sending you both so much love.
I or g my gosh, I’ve spent DECADES on literally “I wish I was born a girl, but there’s nothing I can do about it.”
I'm sure you know this already, but you are amazing. Your partner is one lucky, lucky gal.
Woo 🥰🥰🥰🥰 Give her all of the hugs from us!!!
💝
Good. Good. Yeah my coffee didn’t have enjoy tears in it. Ty OP. Ty

IM NOT BAWLING YOURE BAWLING 🥺🥺🖤
Beautiful story from a beautiful person <3

Wish you all the best in supporting your girlfriend
Thank you for the love! <3
Virtual hugs for you! I know I’m just a random stranger online (and we’re probably geographically far away), but please know that I care about you and your feelings are valid! And yes, she still has a lot of self-hate, not only because of her gender, but I know she will be able to heal… and so will you :)!
I’m sorry that you’ve had to internalize this. The world is cruel to trans people, and we deserve so much better.

You’re a beautiful example of humanity - all of us who are trans are. Being trans is simply a part of the human experience, no matter how many people want to deny or destroy that.

We will not be erased, and we are beautiful.
First of all, I was assigned female at birth, identify as a woman and I too struggle with eyeliner! Lol

Second, thank you so much for these tips! I’ll check Samantha Lux out! I’ll probably learn a lot for myself as well, so me and my girl can practice together! Sounds like a fun activity!
I’m so sorry they weren’t supportive! Virtual hugs! I hope you find/found someone that truly supports you, because they exist, okay?
I could only do it so carefully because of this amazing community! People gave me some really great advices! Thank you for the love! <3
My boyfriend is trans-masc and while I also don't generally like using that thing with him taking control on top, taking good care of erogenous zones I didn't even know I had, and the way he moved I was able to imagine he was the one inside me and not be all icky feeling. I still wasn't really getting much from the thing itself but I really enjoyed the experience as a whole.

So just, something to take into consideration if you want to try something like it. I'm sure my description was garbage though...
Yep, that makes a lot of sense now that I think about it! I’ll talk to her about it when I have the opportunity!
Thank you so much! It is quite late where I live now, but tomorrow I will reach out!
Thank you for that!
What? I just want her to be happy! If she’s trans or not, I’ll be there for her! I’m bi, so really, her identifying as a man, woman or neither is just a detail to me! I love her for who she is! I’m just joyful that she trusts me enough to share her thoughts and feelings and that she’s letting her find herself!
Thank you, I appreciate it!  I’m actually married to a wonderful woman that has helped me quite a lot.  She told me that in ten years she wants to renew our vows and I can either be a man again or we can both be women.  She knows which one I wanted of course.  We have already decided that the picture (in ten years) will go in a space next to our wedding picture!  

It turned out, she was afraid I’d leave her if I transitioned and I was afraid she’d leave me!  Neither of us are going anywhere and I had so many long conversations with her after coming out to both her and myself at the same time.  I really recommend you ask your girlfriend about her experiences.  When she first thought about wanting to be a girl, If she ever tried on women’s clothes when she was younger, etc.  if she’s anything like me, the dam will break and everything will come out.
Yassss makeup together sounds so fun.
Thanks honey, the journey is tough but it gets better every day. X hugs back at you 🤗
No you're totally right! That's exactly what my partner and I do, and it feels almost like she has the penis and I've had my GCS. It's the only way we can be intimate: me on top, straddling her, her on bottom legs out straight. It's super close and intimate.
Fair enough. Sorry if I sounded like a dick. It’s just you’re saying her her her she she she, and they’ve said “I don’t know”.. sounds like you’ve decided for them. 

I have just seen first hand how people can be misguided by the love and affection they receive when coming out. Like.. they never received that as cis, and now they do as trans, no wonder it feels like the answer. 

And, understandably, I don’t think the trans community is very good at supporting people who are unsure. It’s always a push to transition and not a push for self-discovery. Not talking about you, just in general. 

When people are their own gender, they get nothing but as soon as they post themselves as the opposite gender, they are showered with love and affection, it must be really confusing for people already confused. It was for people I know.
That’s so wholesome! And yes, that’s a great idea! I’ll ask her about her experiences!
Confusing or not, no amount of positive or negative external feedback is going to change whether someone is trans or not. Same for being gay or in other ways queer. And I've seen loads of people advocating for self-discovery rather than pushing for a false positive, particularly on mypartneristrans.
Thank you, i know you dont know me but thank you.

I see a lot of myself and my ex (it didn’t work for other reasons) in the two of you and that fills me with indescribable joy. People like you are sometimes the only thing that makes this world survivable and i wish you both the very best.

I dont know if you’ve seen this around but i like giving this link out because it literally changed my life.
https://turnmeintoagirl.com/
Did you ask her about it and did it go well?  Some things are hard to get out initially.
Okay, that’s the cutest website ever, I’m sending it to my girlfriend right now!
Hi! I was finally able to talk to her in person about it! It was very emotional and quite hard for her, but it was a great conversation!
That’s really great!  I was able to do it a little easier with my wife because we have been married for well over a decade at this point.  Being younger and still (most likely) ashamed and scared of who you are inside makes it a lot harder to talk about.  I’m so glad it worked out.  I bet you’re closer than ever now!"	qmazf7	trans	2476	0.96	2021-11-04 02:43:02

You look amazing! Gender identity and feeling comfortable in your own skin is very important, I only figured out a couple months ago that I'm non-binary, so congrats on being able to go out to a party and feel comfortable.
That’s amazing. Congrats! You deserve the world.
:)
Dont worry :) one day every day will be like that
Thats nice and u look good too, am happy for u 😍
1.) You're seriously so stunningly cute.

good thing it was captured on an MI 9T AI Triple Camera
Girl you are a woman of power, consider boots?
Cute!
You're lucky
A question. Why do you change your genitals.
I just never got an answer so could you please explain.
Damn you are so gorgeous babe wow
You look absolutely fantastic, no wonder you feel so good, since you are really you now and everyone recognizes that.  Many more parties and gatherings ahead.  Enjoy every minute.
Rock it girl, you deserve to be happy :)
That is wonderful!  I just got invited to a party as a girl for the first time... I'm not passable like you so my instinct is to say no, but now I am really tempted...   


Congratulations and thank you for the inspiration!
XDDDDDDDDDDDDD
And it realy was, my friends parents dont realy mind it so it is probably the only place I could have done that
Mine is also pink but the lights made everything more red, my lipstick was pink and in the photo it is red
Welcome to Brazil
Tanks :)
Near the end I had to change clothes back to boy mode to go home and every one agreed that I was better in the other way
happy cake day, if i may mention
Awn thanks, I'm sure you look good to
❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks they are my best trait
Thanks :)
.-.
Maybe next year I will be living in another city whith some friends because of college so I'll start living girl mode every day since I'll be away from my parents
Thanks that realy means so much for me
Awn thanks, for someone that have realy bad self image it means a lot that you liked my style
Just in case op reads this: 

You can turn it off in the camera settings
The biggest problem is finding one that fit in me, I'm really looking for one or for a high heel that looks nice
It's a feeling that something wasn't supposed to be there, I haven't had any surgery yet but I pretend to have it done
I’m so happy for you. I bet that euphoria was amazing
Ohhhh I see! So we do match! Nice!
Why did you have to change, if you don't mind saying
Thank you! I didn’t realise! 🎂
I got to play with mew Melt make-up and tops and whiskey last night that charged my euphoria right up! Wanna go back to last night, too!
I do sometimes too. The struggle is real.

But you definitely do look good!
My friend used her phone so I haven't noticed it was there until I post it
Ok👍
Skirt sisters .-.
My parents wouldn't approve it they dont know that I'm trans and I think I'll leave it like that for a little more
Oh, I thought you were in your 20s.
I'll be 18 next month
Ah ok, well you look like so womanly already, hope you can come out to your parents, if that's what you want!

Sir you look like a pokemon villain
Sonic movie actor right there.
So…I can have the testosterone now right? My turn?
You look like that Italian from the boys I like it
Oh my god! Dude you look absolutely ✨ stunning ✨
You look like a supervillain! Red gloves look sick, especially on black w/ the lil bit of red on the shirt
you look like you build killer drones in your garage that you'll one day use to try and catch a blue alien hedgehog
Killer look, sir.
Yoooo this fit is hard !!! 😍😍
Dashing 😉
Dude, my knees are weak!
Please tell me you ride a red motorcycle PLEASE
You look amazing! Good to hear you feel happy
You're so fucking cool, I love your style.
I want to look like you when I grow up (when I can legally get the right surgery’s and testosterone)
You look awesome and remind me of Freddie Mercury. In other words absolutely incredible and I feel you deserve to feel happy.
You've got that Saturday morning cartoon villain energy and I love it
As an AMAB I'm always blown away by how much more man y'all are than I've ever been/looked, I'm so impressed and happy for you. I can only hope my transition in the other direction is even half as effective.
Yes you did honey 💧 it’s giving young Italian Karl Lagerfeld
you look like you evilly scheme in a dark room lit only by a giant screen in front of you, just waiting for the protagonists to arrive and say ""we got you now, Dr. Evildoom!"" only for you to slowly and menacingly turn around in your spinny chair holding a glass of red wine, petting your cat and saying ""ah, I've been expecting you, protagonist. unfortunately for you, my death ray of extermination is complete and ive hidden the disable code in a place you could never possibly find. this is the end of the line for you, intrepid yet oh so stupid hero. ta-ta!"" as you push a big red button on the desk in front of you which opens a trap door that the hero falls down though. you turn back to your screen and let out a deep, evil chuckle as the screen shows an over-the-top feat of technology with a big red laser in orbit of the earth pointed directly at the western hemisphere, new york specifically
Dude you're looking *fresh* af goddamn
You are absolutely slaying my dude
sir, please don´t steal my blaziken, i love her too much to loose her.

I mean this 8n the nicest way, you look like Jim Carrey when he played eggman. And Jim Carrey is one of, if not, my favourite actor
You look almost EXACTLY like my manager at my second job.

Oh yeah and Jim Carrey I guess…
(Seriously you look great)
Damn, you look sharp, sir!
DUDE YOU ARE SO HANDSOME PLS
You look like that bag of yours has 13 piece modular sniper rifle and you're just got in elevator to get to a firebreak floor to shoot your CEO target in a corner office on 36th floor of building opposite side of street.

The rest of the movie will be about how elusive and sophisticated assassin you are with the main good guy coming close to capturing you at least 3 times until in the culmination the hero and you have heartfelt exchange of words and hero lets you go as you explain ""am I really the monster, Mr. Hero? Or is it the system that made one?"" and decide to retire to your cute and cosy chateau in Swiss Alps you have bought with blood money.
I think that is the best moustache I have ever seen
You are a very good looking super villain, bro!
Quite dashing! Love the fit, especially the gloves.
Ummmm ummm ummm, okay sorry no words dude
Handsome villain style

You look great dude!!

You mean like a super model? Hot damn!
Omfg you look amazing

You look like a one off hero in a comic book. Like crime man master of crime
Happy for you! I love your style.

Looking damn good. In the same boat, and feeling fantastic
You kinda remind me of the mechanic, aurelio, from John wick!
Sry for going off topic, but this wall next to you is tripping me out.
You look like the leader of an evil organization in an anime. Quick do a cool pose and come up with a backstory.
You look incredible
How about a before and after just for fun.
You look like Aquaria (Giovanni Palandrani) out of drag.
Wow you're a stunning man.
You look a little bit like Frank Iero, one of the guitarists from the band My Chemical Romance! I love it.
ITS EGGMAN
Hehehe your shirt says feces
My thoughts exactly, and in a very good way
Sexy Giovanni wants to fight.
I didn't even notice that they were trans. My brain just screamed ""Prepare for trouble!""
Or a Persona character (i have never played Persona)
I know the gloves and pointy shoes are just 👌 perfection
I just came to say, that he looks like he is about to join Team Rocket
Take mine. Please I don’t want it
Hi had bugger all natural T to begin with, but you're welcome to what I've got 😂
Wait, im italian, i dont remember any italian in The boys
Wait… do you mean Frenchie? 😭
Big if true
Omg I was thinking the exact same thing.
Freddie Mercury crossed with Team Rocket 👌🔥
this is actually a huge compliment lol, thank you!
And make it double…
Ooh that too
Join no no no this man looks like an elite cell of Rocket specifically meant to cause problems and remove rogue rocket cells.
Yessssss. Stolen
The one with the drugs
Yeah
You're more than welcome, handsome.
Kinda like an auditor, going to different rocket establishment making sure they are up to standards.
The kind that, the moment they walk in every one starts sweating
Mario?
Yeah he was french
As he always calls kimiko ""Mon coeur"" (cuore mio in italian)
Exactly that like he'd check on the Mewtwo research labs keep everything up to code there check the legit businesses and keep actual cops off the company's back and in more extreme cases bring down rogue people as strong as the masked marauder
Wait 

Wasn’t “Frenchie” the guy with the drugs. 

Note: I’m not all the way caught up on the boys so there might be a new character I don’t know about.
Wasnt Frenchie like,you know...French?
Luigi?
Yeah
Well hence my confusion when they said “the Italian guy”

I was like “wait, the only person I remember with all of the drugs was a Frenchman named Frenchie”"	ym9xoa	trans	2464	0.99	2022-11-04 20:46:14
Today is my 41st birthday and the first full year on hrt was 2 days ago, I never though I would get here and im so happy I did!!! Dreams do come true ❤️		"HAPPY BIRTHDAY....WOW you look realy realy beautiful...

I need to start running....

You’re stunning!
You're sooo pretty, happy Birthday 🎂
Congrats!  Oh my goodness you are gorgeous!

41? You’ve got a very young face! Maybe it’s feeling like yourself that’s the true anti ageing secret!! You look gorgeous and happy birthday!!
You look way younger than 41. Happy birthday!
Seeing you at 41 and a year on HRT gives me hope and joy. Happy birthday Honey🎂
Happy Birthday 🎈 You look Fabulous.  I Could only hope to feminize so well.
Happy birthday and congrats on the 1 year anniversary!!! I'm so happy for you!!! 🍾🥳🎉
Happy Birthday!  🎉
U are super cute
damn, you don't look 41, you look half your age,in a good way. Happy birthday <3
If you handed me an ID that said 41 years old I’d think it was fake. You could have said half that and I’d be none the wiser. 

I don’t think I have enough compliments to give about your appearance because my brain is currently short-circuiting from how pretty you are.
You’re beautiful! Go ahead girl 👧 happy birthday 🎂
Beautiful
Happy Birthday!
Darling, happy birthday!

You look beautiful. I'm so happy for you.

Here's to 41! All the best to you.
I said it once, I’ve said it a thousand times, HRT is anti-aging witchcraft! You don’t look a single day over 30!
Sure you don't mean 31?
Happy Birthday young lady. Beautiful
Shut the front door! You look 20 something
Seeing older trans people always gives me hope for the future
One year only? And at 41? Amazing, you're already total goals, you were obviously born for this.
I'm 41 and have just about given up on being happy because I feel too old to transition. Seeing this gives me new hope.
You are stunning!!!
Happy Birthday to you!! You are stunningly beautiful! 💝💖🎉
Oh my goodness... I know this is practically a cliché to say, but you are genuinely an inspiration! All the baby trans femmes out there worried that they ""started too late"" need to see this picture right the hell now, because you are living proof that it's never too late! You are *kiiilllingggg ittttt!!*
Happy Birthday!  I hope you have a wonderful day.  More than that,  I'm so happy for you. You're a beautiful woman. I hope you know that.
Happy birthday! You look gorgeous hope your birthday is wonderful! Also congrats on 1 year!
Looking pretty as always sis!  Happy birthday my friend!  Love you lots!  ❤️❤️❤️

What's your HRT dosage as of now ? can u Share ?

Did you add a filter? You really don't look anywhere close to 40
She said it's all hrt, and I have no reason to not believe her, but yes heaven sent for sure....freaking amazing...very very pretty...if it wasn't on trans I would never believe it.
Iv never had ffs, not yet anyway.
Great picture!
Thanks hun ❤️
No filter but the pic isnt the best so it’s probably hiding some of my flaws also makeup helps! Also I’v never looked my age just lucky!
> You really don't look anywhere close to 40

E is quite often a fountain of youth.
You don't need it.
Did you fill you top lips...notice it seems fuller was that hrt as well? Cause I have no top lip and hoping mine changes...would send you pic of me. But don't know how.
There's no way make up is doing that, you look like you're in your late twenties
Right, no one needs it unless they say they need it
No my face has just always been like this. My cheeks have changed though
Iv just never looked my age just lucky but the makeup is definitely helping lol. I do have a no makeup pic up if you wanna see Me with out makeup its from a few months ago 😊.
Your whole face have changed....you look nothing  at all like pre hrt in 2018 pic...even with out makeup....totally different face...I'll leave you alone e now...I just can't believe the difference.  And how amazing you look...I hope I look a 1/4 of the way you do.
Aw thannks again but a lot of that is just weight loss. I was fat in 2018 lol my face has been changing lately i will say that for sure!!
Wow, Happy birthday again...hope you have e a blessed one...take care...thanks for responses...
You’re welcome and thank you!!!
Very welcome sweetie."	xroe2p	trans	2403	0.98	2022-09-30 01:13:54
Happy 4 months of HRT to me ❤️🖤❤️ (MtF)		"[deleted]
I need to know your secrets. How did you deal with facial hair? Are you wearing much makeup, you don't seem to be? How long did it take to grow out your head hair? You're beautiful and completely unclockable
Beautiful!😘
This feels silver worthy...
Nice Gengar mask... I see you also are a lady of culture. 

Gotta catch 'em all!

Happy transiversary. As if you didn't know, you look incredible =)
Damn vampires.
I see an mmmmmmmmmmmmm
Ive been seeing you quite a bit on here and have been kind of following you during your trans journey. I just wanted to ask because im trying to get the opinion of as many ppl as posible. How much did your septum and tattoo saying “sasori” hurt from a scale of one to ten. You’re beautiful btw i wish my facial hair was as thin as yours haha.
Looking beautiful!
Ooo i love your nails
Congrats you look stunning
You look absolutely gorgeous. 😘😘😘😍😍😍
OK I THINK I JUST FELL IN LOVE💕💕💕
Classic Pretty 🦋
That adornment on ur neck is 👌🏻😜
You look so beautiful 💜
Love your outfit!
Ahhhhh so cute
Oh my god you look amazing
cutie🥰
You look stunning!
Why does it look like theres a phone charger plugged into the microwave?
Absolutely stunning!
Girl your looking good. Got to admit I’m a bit jealous lol. Keep rocking it
This gives me a lot of hope (I have an HRT consul in a two weeks)
Happy Monthiversary/Hormoniversary!
You look fantastic! Your just so beautiful.  Best wishes on your journey.
congrats...you are so gorgeous ;-)
How old where you when you started HRT? You look amazing btw!
Holy shit how? I would die for you
U look adorable. I I'd have that confidence when I was ur age
Queen shit
So happy for you good job!!!💜💜💜💜
Bruh if you never said anything I wouldn't have been able to tell that you're mtf. Im mtf, just starting out, still short hair, not hrt yet, still hairy, but stuff like this really gives me hope that it's possible to be what I want to be.
Nice piercing! Curious though, it looks to me like you probably aren't wearing any/much makeup. Did you do any facial hair removal or is it like you had naturally less hair to begin with?
Crush mode activated.
U look really good for only 4 months on hrt
Pretty
Wow congratulation you’re goals to look towards
Congratulations looking awesome. Have a Merry Christmas
Gengar masks are cool, sure. But your *hair* omg i love it
Congratulations on living as your authentic self
😍😍😍
4 months??? I'm 3 months and still look the same 😥 

You look amazing
Quick question, but how did you get the HRT medication?
You are very gorgeous.
Ayo you cute asf HOW 😭🤚🤚
Wow, you’re actually one of the most beautiful people I’ve ever seen in my life.
You look amazing! I love that mask, goes well with your shirt, and your hair looks awesome. Your whole style is just really cool.
Can I get some advice? Since I’m a minor how do I come out as trans to my parents and tell them that I want to be a girl? 

Maybe not the best terminology but I’m from Estonia :)
looking super fem :)
Wow, amazing results. I'm very happy for you.
Oh my god. You’re the most gorgeous little bean ever!
Pretty 😍
I don't know what you're talking about :)
Glad I’m not the only one who immediately noticed that
1. I naturally never had too much facial hair, but HRT thinned what I had. Additionally, I shave my mustache every week or two. 
2. Not a drop of makeup here! I can't do my own haha
3. Good question. It's been 2-3 years since I last got a haircut to shorten!!!
Thank you ❤️🖤
❤️🖤
Thank you friend 🖤
My septum? 4/10! Really easy, really quick!!

The tattoo started at a 5/10, to a 2/10, then the end of it I was really stressed and u comfortable all the way to 6 or 7!
Thank you ❤️🖤
They're my fav colors!!!
Thank you ❤️
I'm so excited for you, you got this
thank you friend ❤️
17, now I'm 18!
Magic!
Hell yeah!
trying my best ❤️🖤
Never did laser, and no makeup!
❤️
OP to her parents:
It's pretty obvious 😅
It was the first thing I noticed.
1. What a gift! About hair in general, how much has HRT thinned it in your experience? I don't think i can escape the need for removal on my face but unsure about the rest of the body
2. Wow, you're naturally stunning, i don't even know what makeup would do to improve your looks

You look gorgeous honey x
Every week or two?! I have to shave mine daily and even then I’d be having to put a ton of foundation on to cover the stubble. Of course, I’m not on HRT, so there’s that, but still!

Also, just sayin’.. you’re hella cute and I’m seriously jealous of that love bite; whether I’m jealous of the person who gave it to you or of you for having it, I’m not sure yet
Can i add to those questions? I’m just curious how you do your eyebrows, if you change much or if hrt did anything ect
wow you have amazing skin then! Take care of it :)
Those eyes😍 You are going to break hearts❤
Ah i see. I’ve been considering a septum for a bit because im not sure my eyebrow piercing will work out and might reject but that led to me noticing my nose is slightly crooked which kinda sucks cause idk if i can pull it off but thanks for sharing anyway. Oh and also you’re hella pretty :3
Thanks! In the meantime, keep going! 4 months on HRT made you look cis.
Gosh, im envious. I'm just now being real with myself at 24. Those 6 years do an annoying amount
I have to see them Sunday. 

Sigh.
1. Not sure, haha. It has definitely not grown in as fast but I am stil considering laser. It's different for everyone!!!
2. ❤️🖤
I went from having to shave twice a week to be presentable (as a man) to only needing to shave once every ten days or so. 

But when I go into girl-mode the stubble is still apparent.
For eyebrows? Nothing comes to mind. Haven't touched them at all!
Anyone can do a septum, you got this
Oof I feel that 😔👌💙
I hope u did better than denying it's a love bite 😅
I want to know what did they thought it was 😂
Oh laser is amazing it can be expensive, but if you only get the face done it's about 100-150 to remove it completely usually
Really??? But they look so fem!? Lucky"	kg1rhv	trans	2388	0.98	2020-12-19 05:09:12
I am a woman. Some days I have stubble. Some days I speak in a deeper voice. Some days I can't be bothered with makeup. It doesn't make me any less of a woman. I am who I am and nothing can change that! Fuck the haters. I'm happy with who I am! 💕		"My AFAB cis bff tells me that not wanting to put your makeup on in the morning is one of the most feminine feelings she's shared with basically every other woman.
I'm wearing a football jersey and dirty men's jeans while sporting stubble but a stranger still called me ma'am a few minutes ago. I'm sure my mask helped.
my wife is trans.  i like to stroke her face in bed in the morning when she has stubble.  she's the most beautiful girl in the world to me.
What's a stubble? Btw you're very pretty
It doesn't matter what others thinks, all that matters is how you feel yourself. If you are happy, then nothing else matter.
You are beautiful just as you are.
That's the spirit. You rock girl!

Xoxo
This and you are beautiful 🖤 

ps I love your hair and might steal some inspo from it
You are a beautiful woman!!!

I cut my hair these days and it looks so much like yours. This haircut is really powerful xD

Indeed, fuck the haters and jealous people who are ashamed to become what they truly are. Or are enslaved to conservative religion
Own that shit, love. Support and solidarity 👑
I love it sister! Being comfortable being you is the point of what we do. You look good no matter what mode you are in let no one tell you other wise!
You look absolutely gorgeous with or without makeup and I love your hair as well 😊💜💚

Frick yea girl! As an mtf, I definitely need to hear (and absorb lol) this more
Ugh, that hair. Beautiful 🥺💗
Well that's a mood and half


P.S. You're beautiful
Well. Im sitting infront of my computer in my girlfrinds robe her nice yoga pants, a Bra just for fun with her robe. Today is a flex day for me lol and luckily I never really have to out because of what I do.
Omg is that a Chloe price tank your wearing? if not you’re still rocking it anyway.
Fuck yeah!
You tell ‘em, girl!
That's good for you at least your happy
You're gorgeous, love! Make-up motivation is sooo hard for me some days too. We still cute tho!
I absolutely love all of these looks
You don’t need to be feminine or even remotely look like a female in any way whatsoever to be a woman! Don’t listen to the haters! You go girl!
Ur so pretty!
Preach it girlie!
Yeah girl! That's the spirit! We are valid 🌈💖🥰
girl YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!

Wow, that's some inspirational confidence. I hope I can get to that point.
Hell yas queen! 💖
You’re 100% right, I wish you the best and keep going you’re a wonderful woman ! 😊
So fudging same!

I love this and I love you for putting into words how I feel when someone tells me that I'll ""never be what I want to be for Reasons.""

Thank you so much for this and for sharing <3 Keep on rocking and putting the boots/heels to the haters <3
you are a woman sis! brilliant pics :]
You don't have to present perfectly coiffed to the nines femme to be a woman. You're a woman in cargo shorts and a tank top, just like me.
Girl I LOVE your hair!
You’re not alone 💕 I’m the same way! My voice is gravely and deep, and even with laser I’m in a battle with my face hair. I love makeup but can’t be assed to do it everyday. Hair usually in a tail or MESSY bun. Chipped nails are a must too 😂
You are right in any way !
You also got really pretty hair ○♡○
I feel you sister. I’m the same way
still very pretty
omg you are so fkin pretty🥺
You have pretty eyes 🤎🤎
I swear im gonna get a single face tattoo, right on my mustache area that says ""Fuck Passing."" You look amazing girl ❤😘
I've been out for 7 years, and I still don't bother with make up
What's a woman?
And this is reddit-worthy how exactly? I mean I’m not hating I’m also part of lgbt but why do people just walk around bragging about this shit

Edit: whoever downvoted is retarded
I feel this right in my ❤️
You are a woman and youre pretty
looks like the main character to me
PREACH IT

That one makes sense LOL
Awh that's so sweet! 💕
The stage after a 6 o'clock shadow. Where the hairs not quite long enough to shave yet still visible to the eye.

I wish I could... I honestly don't know.. I wash it once a week to preserve the dye, rinse it the other times i shower. towel dry then air dry it... 

Other than that it's literally held in place with either a head band or a beanie XD
It is xD in the first image.
Tha k youuu. I need to redye it soon.
I haven't even started LHR yet.. Still saving up.

Literally everything goes on reddit. Don't like it, don't look at it.

lol
Nice 😄
ooooh, gl! I dunno much about dyeing hair but hope it goes well c:, do you think you'll do the same color?
Ah yes, everything from “why the age of consent should be lowered to 10” to “why you should give Joe Fruitcake a blowjob”, all the essentials of the shittiest website. Everything is here.
it's extremely costly.. I'm slowly saving up for it XD
Yeah but it'll be a nicer shade and hopefully the same shade all over 😂😂
pretty much XD

Ahhhhhhhh, I'm so happy! Just had my first date as a trans woman, over a year into hrt, and it went so good 😊 (I'm pink hair 😛 )		"You two look so happy.

You both look so cute and happy!! Good for yall :,)

Aaaaa cute!
Is your date also trans?
You both have pink hair-?
I'm happy for the two of you!

*But I can't stop thinking that the person on the right looks like Drew Gooden, also known as the ""Road work ahead? Uh, I sure hope it does"" guy from vine who eventually made a YouTube channel* no offense
[deleted]
I guess I view hers as red or orange haha. I'm on the right 😛
[removed]
It was amazing 😊 best first date ever!
It is SO fluffy 😆
The hat has a funny story actually 😅 I work at Starbucks and one of my last days before transferring to another store I saw this hat was still in the bost and found after a few weeks so I took it! It's like my only hat and it fits perfectly 😆
I'm not necessarily sure that's information I should disclose but I know she is open about it and I think she's inspirational sooooooo yes 😚
[removed]
My bad, didn't realize so many people saw her's as pink haha; I see it as more red or orange. I'm on the right 😛
It is offensive 😒 I don't know any trans woman that would want to be compared to someone of their assigned gender, ever, no matter how popular. Please be more concious of what you say to people, especially considering where you're saying it.
Calling her “bro” is pretty dickish
Oh gotcha! Well you're both gorgeous 💖
Yea !
Glad to hear it
Yesss I’m a hat girl myself for sure! I collect them haha
[removed]
I understand and I am sorry, I was hoping that my statement would be humorous but I see now how it could be seen as offensive. My bad.

Still happy for you
Im sorry I use that language with everyone I didn’t mean it like that. But I’m sorry your right I should’ve been more sensitive to that.
[removed]
I appreciate your acknowledgement. Some people just get mad when I call out a statement that wasn't recieved well even if I expect it was meant well. Thank you, and thanks for the happy sentiments ❤

omggg, how do you manage to look like that? *reveal your secrets, or else, pretty please*
Girl I love that outfit and hair! Hella jealous since I can’t do much even though I’m out. Hate the waiting game.
It feels really nice to come out to people, I've only told two or three local people, I'm stealth to everyone else... but one of these days I will tell more people.
I wish i could be as happy as you sound here. But your really cute!

Nice, reddit is also supportive
It must be so wonderful to see the real you emerging. You have the most fabulous hair- consider me jealous! xxx
Cute!!!!!!!!!
The right amount of mystery , growing confidence and long legs,  is a girls best friend , which I was in your circle of friends you would be welcome with wide open arms , go girl go !
Yep. I'm still gay
Thank you!! I've been getting much better with taking pictures recently lol, and finding support amongst friends is such a wonderful experience!
Thank you!
Tysm! I've felt a lil limited on outfits recently so making new ones even if they're simple is v v fun!
One of my fav outfit pairings!
Thanks! I use head and shoulders shampoo and pantene pro v shampoo/conditioner. I dont always use the same stuff but it's that at the moment
They're some of my fav combo, I'm getting some more thigh high socks soon aswell!
I appreciate your appreciation!!
AAA THANK YOUUU!!
Tysm!
Ahaha thanks!
Thigh high socks make me feel so cute!
Awwww thank you so much!
The waiting is seriously the worst, I'm not out to family so I can't really present much outside my room sadly :(
It's an amazing feeling, I've gotten so many positive reactions it leaves me hopefully for the future
I shall, thank you!!
Thanks!!
Tysm!
It really is, and thank you!
Can I suggest against pantene??? (pantene causes frizz and breakage) Try curly girl  Or ask for recommendations at r/femalehairadvice
They really look great on you, love to see more when you get them
It’s that time for me to wait for my hair and HRT consul next month. Until then I’m stuck
I'll bet! I've gotten some supportive remarks from other trans people, I've honestly only told one non-trans person I know.
Next month will come before you known it! I wish you the best of luck!
Thank you! Have a good transition yourself!"	kcw8ji	trans	2356	0.97	2020-12-14 11:52:50

update I finally did it, I bought a binder >:) I'm so happy		"Tbh this doesn't look like a very good or safe binder. Clasps and being made all of the same fabric instead of a binding panel with the rest being stretchy and breathable are red flags.
Edit: so I canceled the order due to many of you guys saying this one isn't good I'll try to fine a better one 🙂
I got one of these and it was horrible, the clasps hurt me, it was too tight and the fabric gave me rub burns, it was also really hard to put on. Wouldn’t recommend.   I threw it away after wearing it once 🥲. Got a new one from underworks and it’s much better.
Ok finally ordered the good brand for my binder oh gosh I littlerally went throght allot of lies to get more info from my mom without her knowing what I was actually doing, I know I had to pretend I was signing up for my PayPal again 😮‍💨
Congratulations comrade.
Underworks is a good brand, I've been hearing consistently that gc2b's quality isn't what it used to be, and underworks is a bit cheaper too,  my binder I got from them is very comfortable and doesn't put much strain on my ribs at all
I don’t see anywhere to keep your notes /j

In all seriousness though, Congrats fam!
So would I need to get my normal size or a size smaller.. I'm not sure 😥
heard you cancelled the order. i think gc2b is having a sale rn jsyk!
Eeeke!! Cancel the order!! I have that one and it is TERRIBLE!!
finaly somewhere for you to store your paperwork
Oooo Amazon is not the place for that, it's better to save the money and buy a cheap one from GC2B, coming from someone who bought binders from Amazon before they are never comfortable or safe and often to small even of you size yourself correctly.

Get the Honey  browsers extentson then hope on gc2b trust me it'll last a lot longer
Congratulations
Congrats bro!
I had one like those, and turns put they are not good for you

There's g2cb binders and underworks
I've had this binder, before- 
Just make sure to wash it often,  and remember that the stretchy fabric wears out after about five months. It started working like a sports-bra for me.    But then again, I used to be a little bit large around my chest. Now I'm on T, and it does wonders.       

GC2B binders are absolutely awesome, so maybe save up for one of those after? They can ride up, but it's worth it.         


But, I am happy for you, bro- The feeling of buying a new binder is the best, especially if its your first!
I can absolutely recommend the brand ""Binderme"" on Etsy. They're way more comfortable than the Amazon ones and are actually made with Western people in mind. They're so comfortable!

They also aren't pushing down on your ribs and make my B cup into a believable male chest.
Awesome! Congrats!
DO NOT BUY BINDERS WITH CLIPS ON THE SIDE! They can force you to bind tighter than your body can handle and cause permanent rib damage.
Amazon binders are garbage. I got a similar one but it didn't do shit. Congrats tho
Someone just called me fat indirectly like tf, what are you trying to imply u/RealisticDanni and yes imma call you out I hope you see this you hypocrite ""just lose weight like a normal person"" first of all who ever said I was wanting to lose weight my body is healthy and who are you to judge someone behind a screen 🤨
Hey, as one that has that exact same binder, you're gonna be pulling it up a lot. At least I have to. Overall the binder is comfortable and very durable, but the elastic doesn't go all the way up the binder so it's a little awkward, or maybe mines too big?? I dunno. But congrats! Super happy for you
[removed]

[removed]
Good job and congrats on taking another step! Amazon binders aren’t very good though, so if you like the feel/idea then I recommend buying from gc2b or Spectrum Outfitters! They’re international by-trans-people-for-trans-people companies that sell in a wide range of colors and sizes!
My ex had one and we used to joke about it being his bulletproof vest, or we'd just quote MW3 "" Tango's reported to have C4 strapped to they're chest! "" - proud of yall though
I don't get it
Flavent streetware  ans gc2b are the ones that have worked well for my body shape  you can look at my profile for reference  of what I look like
Before I even saw the title I was like ooo I think I want one of those xD

But then I realized I have nothing to bind ;-;
hey! there's a new ""compression top"" available at target for about $25 that is really similar to a binder (if accessibility is an issue)

not sure if i'm allowed to link stuff, but you can find it online [here](https://www.target.com/p/pride-adult-tomboyx-compression-top-black/-/A-84762515?preselect=84661103#lnk=sametab) or in stores. it's part of the ""tomboy"" collection.

good luck and feel free to pm me to ask questions about binders :)
Bind safely! 🙏❤
yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeag thats awesome
PURRRR
Hey OP, I know you've gotten great advice already, but I actually got that exact binder as my first and it didn't go great 😅 It was hard to get on and off, and breathing was definitely restricted. It was good to validate my gender euphoria, but because of how restrictive it was (flatter chest) it made me think I was a smaller GC2B size than I actually was because my normal size didn't achieve the flatness I got from this one. If you still want to try this one out, legit don't do anything that would elevate your breathing and don't keep it on longer than an hour or two and be aware of any painful breathing or sore ribs. My love with you and best of luck!!
That's awesome! Please bind safely.
Edit: typo
Oh gosh I didn't really think about that- well I will see how things work out then later i'll try to find a better one
second this. I bought an offband and I'm still dealing with the damage caused by it. its not worth it, sorry op
I have two. The clasps hook a giant elastic band around your chest. Uncomfortable and unsafe.
Sorry that you got that hope and joy yanked, but better than trying and disliking, or worse hurting yourself with it.
Thanks 😄
Upvote for dorkiness 😆
Your normal size for sure! even a size bigger if you want to exercise or swim in it (make sure it’s okay to swim with it if you want to do that)
normal size. don't choose a size smaller. I did that once because I wanted a flat chest so badly and I couldn't breathe because of it
Ooh!! Thanks cause binders are really expensive 😅
Due to the budget I have
Yea idk why I thuoght amazon was a great idea, somtimes i dont think but it's ok i canceled it before they shipped the binder :)
Thanks!
I canceled that order and got one from underworks
 ^-^
Yea I was told that so I canceled this one a bought one off of Wonderworks

You should try and get a new one. Those types of binders are dangerous as hell and can really mess you up. Amazon is not the place for binding. Poorly made ones are dangerous.
Tf dude? Not cool at all.
If it doesn't work I HIGHLY recommend the underworks Econo series binders. You can use the other series too, but the Econo ones have the most comfortable material. I also recommend spectrum outfitters (they are a little pricey though, but definitely worth it). What I don't recommend is gc2b. They used to be the leading brand for binders, but they have decreased in quality by a whole lot in the recent years, with a lot of people saying that they rip and stretch after only a few wears.
Until then, just do the same thing you should be doing even with 'real' binders - work up to wearing it for long periods by putting it on for short periods (30min to an hour) at first; listen to your body; take it all the way off for breaks; don't work out in it; do stretches to open up your back/chest/shoulders and deep breathing exercises before and after you put it on/take it off.

Some binders are more hazardous or safer relative to others, but ALL compression garments *compress* in a way that your body is not adapted to handle for long periods, and are capable of causing chronic health issues if worn ignoring things like discomfort and difficulty breathing.  


That said, binders that are elastic all the way around *are* more likely with regular long wear to do damage, including deforming or dislocating ribs. I don't mean this to scare you out of wearing it, but rather to encourage you to exercise due caution and practice body awareness while introducing something that, depending on fit, can have a serious impact on health. A quality binder will feel snug, and you're going to be aware of the compression, but there should NOT be pain or notable physical discomfort.
Another great brand is underworks, they run a bit expensive but they last way longer than any other binder I've tried, my last one lasted from 8th grade through high school until my junior year
Spectrum is super comfortable, check out the selling thread on ftm because people often sell/give away binders.

I brought some gc2b ones which where just not for me and then I was given a spectrum one which I love
If it doesn’t work, gc2b is great, although I’ve heard they don’t have the best sizing range so idk if that would be an issue for you or not
I have the exact one and I really don’t recommend but if you do wear it I recommend a sports brah underneath because it’ll roll up and stab you
Oof ouch, yeah not great
That is true and honestly I'm so glad everyone told me before it was to late
Underworks binders are like 20 bucks.
Seems like your mad but makes sense cause an intellectual wouldn't respond with so much negativity but who am i to judge anymore lmao but have great day unfortunately couldn't respond quick cause you see I have a life outside of reddit but like I said who am I to judge other people :)
Thank you for telling me this cause Honestly I never would have known this information and probably would have ended up getting hurt due lack of knowledge, so thank you allot!"	urasse	trans	2302	0.97	2022-05-17 01:02:38

Didn't notice until you pointed it out, still beautiful!
Thank you Ms phx :)
Thank youuuu! :) If you're actually curious, I posted a comment the other day about how I do my eye makeup.

https://www.reddit.com/r/transpassing/comments/qjznvg/comment/hitrp2h/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3
Well it was actually made for my wife! Hahaaaaaaa, I stole it from her. It's what she deserves for stealing my hoodies for the last 7 years lol.
Yeah, no, I drop and trip over everything I touch. But thank you anyway lol
Oh wow I don't know if I've ever been called elegant before lol. Thank you :)
Ha! I guess the hair is kinda similar isn't it. And thanks :)
Exactly what I was thinking :O stunning !
Awww thank ya :) eyeliner is so hard! I'll have to try out some new shades of shadow too. I've just got a basic flesh tone pallette right now.
I think I am in love
Ooooo, she's cute! I'll take it! Lol
Well it's due to folks like you, in large part. I was never anything more than an ally to the LGBTQ community for a long time, but in the last few months I've felt the most unconditional, warm, and loving welcome from everyone here. I've made real friends here. Folks whose stories are so much like mine. Part of me is glad I realized I was trans purely because it meant I got to discover this beautiful world and everyone that comprises it.
I'll have to ask my wife lmao. It's hers (she knows).
Whaaat you're the 2nd person to comment that on this post. Lol. I guess maybe there's something to it.
I A M G O A L S that is so cool lol. Thanks :)
K seriously I'm a wee bit drunk but if I haven't messaged you in like 2 days, hit me up, and I'll go into my closet and tell you what brand the dress is lol
Thank ya! I like the bright pink lipstick :) idk if it's ""in"" or not but idt being trans is really ""in"" either so who fucking cares lol
Awww stoppppppppp lol ^(but rly don't stop)
Happy Cake Day marksthrowawaynsfw! Wherever life plants you, bloom with grace.
Yup! My initial HRT consultation is in January. You can either choose a regular endo or a trans-friendly endo, and (surprise surprise) the trans-friendly endos are in high demand, typically. So yeah. The wait is longer. But I feel like it's worth it.
Yep! My HRT consultation is in January and I CANNOT wait. And thank you :)
Well I'm slowly eradicating my stubble one laser sesh at a time lol. 1 down, like 11 more to go! PS, facial laser hair removal is PAINFUL AS FUCK if you've got a thick beard. Which I do. lol. But it's #worth.
yo omg this is exactly what i was looking for actually, thank you!! 💕
Omg perfect lol
Cool, please let me know.
I didn't notice other people's comments hahah you're similar really though
My mtf girlfriend has being going through that and electrolysis! It sounds SO painful! Laser hair removal gets rid of more hair but she says it's way more painful! Proud of you! You're a bad ass!
You are hella welcome girly :)
Okay, seriously here: I am preeettttttttttty drunk right now. I'm serious. Fucking message me in like a couple of days if I haven't gotten back to you. I'll go straight tf into my closet and find the dress and tell you where it's from. Message me. I will forget.
I think it's the hair, but I'll take it!!!
Laser hurts a fair bit (especially if you've got thick, large-diameter hair), but it's over really quickly. Like, each ""zap"" treats an area about the size of a nickel. Hurts like fuck, but again, it's over sooo fast. Just grin & bear it. My aesthetician says it's a little worse than a tattoo (I've never gotten a tattoo but I want to someday). So that doesn't mean much to me, but it might to you.

I'll probably end up doing some electro to clean up stubborn stragglers. Maybe I'll have good luck tho and laser will take care of all of it. Cross your fingers for me :) Also shoutout to you for loving your MtF GF. Idk if it's what you signed up for but regardless, you're a beautiful person.

I used the women’s bathroom for the first time by myself!	I’m 14, and not out to most people, let alone anywhere near passing, however today, I was out with one of my transmasc-non binary friends, and we needed the toilet. However, the ones we went to were in this under-used car park, as they recently put in a massive shopping centre with massive car park, therefore no one else was using the toilets. Therefore, we both decided that we would use our gender-affirming toilets, rather than our SAAB. I’m just really happy, and I know I wouldn’t have done it without him! (Thanks moth!!)	"That is awesome! Congrats!
For a cis person, not familiar with much of the transgender vocabulary, would you care to enlighten me on what SAAB means? I can only think of the Swedish aircraft manufacturer 😅
OMG That’s amazing. Idk what to call the feeling you get when you do stuff like that but it’s so euphoric!
YAYAYAY!
🤩
Congrats! I did so myself for the first time just yesterday, it really feels like making progress with confidence.
Congrats!! 💖💖
Congratulations!! ^_^
Omg go you!
Congratulations!! And to Moth too!! :tips hat:
That's a powerful and reclaiming experience. I'm glad you had it in a safe space. :)
Congratulations to both of you! I wish you luck on your transition :)!
Fuck yeah your friends name is Moth? Iconic
YAY IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!! it’s way cleaner, as a transmasc i miss having a clean bathroom but love using the right one lol
Good Job! I used the men’s room once at school... NEVER AGAIN. It stunk, I was anxious as hell, and there was only 1 (one) stall so if someone came in and needed to take a sh*t, it would be awkward. It is sooo scary, I’m glad you got the guts to do it. (Also, tell your friend that I love their name!)

-Apollo (he/they/xe)
I remember using the men's bathroom for the first time and it felt like a huge weight lifted off my chest. Im happy for you!!!
Omg congrats!! Im 20 and pass well enough in canada (not great but a lot less TERFS) and I wish I had the courage u do cause im still to scared use the mens bathroom alone 😅
My mom always goes to the bathrooms with me to make sure nobody makes a big deal, but my dad... he just forces me to use the men's room
congrats!!! that's so awesome!! :) if there is one thing i miss from per-transition its those clean, clean ladies' rooms
I'm so happy for you.
On any other subreddit the title out of context would be a concerning declaration.  On here, something to be congratulated for! 😊
ahh congrats!! thats so awesome!!! :D
that’s great! I’m so glad you were able to do that, good job for working up the courage
Way to go girl! Hope you have much luck in future!
Im scared to do anything like this lads
Who ever would think we,d get so much pleasure from going for a pee congratulations girl💖✨🙏 Huggz Becky
That’s so awesome! I’m so proud of you for being so brave so young! I wish I had the clarity of mind to know I was trans when I was 14
HIS NAME IS MOTH?! THATS RAD AS FUCK
Congrats! \^\^  
Good decision. If you can, do what you feel is better for you. Not for others, for you. This is your life and don't let others ruin it. \^\^
i know a Moth, are you in Virginia by any chance?
Congrarulations! I wish I had this courage when I was 14 :P
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I’m so excited for you!!!!!
That is so amazing! Glad to hear!
wow you can be so proud of yourself!!!
You go I believe in you
Jesus Christ! 14?! The liberals are fucking insane. We have to stop letting them brainwash our children.

I’m so happy for you!
MY first time was in Kansas in 1998 or 9....
Lisa Cry was in charge of Ekdhal Dining on KU. She literally CHASED ME out of the bathroom, out of the building, and entirely off campus the first day I used the women’s. They’ve since entirely razed the building where this happened, and I feel glad.
I feel so happy for you, I currently lack the confidence to do thar my self
I'm good I'll just never use the bathroom 😌
**S**ex **A**signed **A**t **B**irth.
Sex assigned at birth, but I would think of the car manufacturer.
Or people use AGAB. Assigned Gender At Birth.
[deleted]
I haven't seen it used before but I'm pretty sure it would be sex assigned at birth.
As a trans woman who somehow hasn't heard the term either, my guess is Sex Assigned At Birth.
Don't worry I'm trans and didn't know what it meant till now
Sex Assigned At Birth!
It stands for sex assigned at birth
Sex assigned at birth.
Sex assigned at birth.
I believe it means sex assigned at birth.
i think “sex assigned at birth”! 

vroom vroom
from what I know SAAB is “sex assigned at birth”
I first thought of the planes and cars as well
They have acquired Saab grippen multirole aircraft
Gender euphoria is the term
I was scared out my skin that a cis woman would walk in, and call me a pervert, as I’m nowhere near passing, and the uk is full of TERFS.
Thank you. I wish you luck too.
It really was so much cleaner. Before I went here, I used the men’s toilet twice, in two more popular spots, and it was disgusting. When I went here, I didn’t even have to worry about wiping the seat down. On the other hand, my friend was complaining of shit-stains up the wall, and a piss-sodden floor.
So one parent is amazing and the other won't let you use the bathroom you're comfortable with
Honestly, when we both came out, the first thing my friend talked about was the smell, and the stereotype that men peeing faster being obvious, from the piss-laden floor
I know.
I still feel like I’m faking it, to fit in, especially as it turns out a lot of my friends are not cis, even though I didn’t know that when my egg started cracking.
Nope.
What’s disgusting?
What do you mean is ""disgusting""?
I feeleth so joyous f'r thee, i currently want the confidence to doth thar mine own self

^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)

Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`
That makes sense, thanks so much!
Is there a difference between SAAB and AGAB?
Gotcha, thanks so much!
We should start using this as code for “sex assigned at birth.”
Honestly I was reading it and I was like why are they peeing in their car or taking the car into the toilet with them?!

Edit: early morning, writing shit wrong lol
Whew! Glad I’m not alone, haha.
Yup, I only used a one person bathroom in a place with not many people, so not nearly as brave as what you did - I hope to be there someday. 

You, girl, are an inspiration! And jeez, only at 14, hurrah!
You're welcome :)! And thanks too.
YEPPP. my first time i used a men’s restroom i literally was at a loss for words. the floor was sticky and it was hard to walk, absolutely foul 99% of the time
Yep, women's bathrooms are sooooo much cleaner here too. I still wipe down the seat but I've never really had to. No piss on the floor or toilet paper everywhere either. I'm so glad I never have to use a men's room again!
Yup... one makes me feel hopeful and comfortable with letting me be who I know I truly am, and the other thinks I'm a brainwashed idiot because of the internet and TV (his evidence being that I believe in climate change and all the different covid guidelines) despite the fact that learned everything that I tell him in school. One of them helps me find underwear that I actually feel comfortable wearing, the other suggests that I wear boys trunks to the beach simply because he ""cant find a bathing suit that would work"" as if we can't just Google it and find one. One tells me every day that she wishes that she was allowed to just... let me take the hormones, but thats not allowed because of the other parent, who would need to sign a contract for it. He always reminds me that even if I do have the surgeries, I will still have a masculine body. He has me always do masculine work for him, he will say that if somebody complements me that they meant it to somebody else, its terrible. 

I dont know where I can like... go to say this without bugging anybody, but it hurts. For him to not be here for me for like... more than half of my life, and then the other half he barely interacts with me, meaning that he technically has only spent about less than 3 enjoyable years with me, where most of the time he was still talking with his dates one after another and not getting to know me. Not getting to know about how I was depressed (well, he knew I think, but he never seemed to get how bad it was, despite me having to take medicine for it.) I dont understand how somebody who barely even knows me,who has no interest in anything I love, or even respects me as a person has so much control over what I do with my body. I dont think he even noticed how much happier I am simply being alive since I found out who I am..

Sorry I hope this isnt annoying, I just.. I dunno where else to post this but once I think about this, it makes me livid. And guess who I got my anger issues from too?
You feel like you’re faking being trans to fit in with your friends? If that’s the case then I wish I was born when you were because that’s NOT how you’d try to fit in when I was your age lol. I feel like I’m faking it sometimes too, but then I remember how good it feels to be true to myself. My recommendation is to do your best not to alter your behavior to cater to others, and express yourself in the way that feels the most honest to you. Whether you fit in or not with your peers won’t matter in the long run, because we all have to live with ourselves. And the people who truly care about you will want you to be happy. If someone is your friend only if you fit their specific mold, they aren’t really your friend.
gotcha
To me, they're the same thing, but with different wording.

AGAB: **A**ssigned **G**ender **A**t **B**irth

SAAB: **S**ex **A**ssigned **A**t **B**irth
TIL gang!  I didn't know either 🤷‍♀️
Thank you. Sad thing is, this was an alternative for using the gender-neutral toilets they had down the road, which seemed to be closed off, despite no sign signifying as such.
It's not annoying, I'm glad you got that out! It's frustrating that someone who doesn't even respect you has that much control over your body. It's such a relief that you have your mum, she sounds very loving.
Ah, that sucks. And sorry your country is not the best place for trans people. I’m in the U.S. and lucky to live in a liberal state.
It’s okay. Would be so much better however if you didn’t have to wait for 4 years to get hormones on the nhs.
That’s such fuckin bullshit. My doctor was willing to prescribe on the first day, no questions asked, no tests, no therapy, no waiting. Informed consent should be the norm.
I wish we had informed consent. In the uk, for the entire trans youth population, there are only two clinics authorised to administer prescriptions of hormones, one in London and one in Leeds. For adults, it doesn’t improve much, with only about 5 I think. Therefore horrific wait times, and that’s before the year of “lived experience”. And this was all before the high court banned the administration of puberty blockers to trans kids. No wonder the s*****e rates are so high among trans people.
I’m so sorry, that’s horrible. It’s transphobic and hateful to have such a system. I hope things get better or you can get out, or whatever you need.

Woah, didn’t expect to find a comment like this in this sub of all places. 

This is something I do have strong views about, but at this point, I’m too exhausted to get into an internet argument with a stranger over. 

I’m not sure if your comment is intended to be some kind of “gotcha!” like it’s some impeccable logic that explains why minors shouldn’t transition, but nobody is really impressed with this argument, as it’s ultimately based on preconceptions of what being trans even is.

I’m sorry if this sounds condescending, but I’d rather just direct you to some other things than really engage here. It’s an argument I’ve had before in other inappropriate places, and while one could say a trans subreddit is a better place to have this discussion, this particular sub is meant to be more of a safe space for the trans community, not a place where we have to justify our existence and defend our rights from people who don’t really understand what it’s like.

If you want to hear my thoughts on it, I’ve argued this on Reddit before:

https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBrosUltimate/comments/mfyeoe/share_anywhere/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Yeah, it’s on a smash bros sub - but to be fair, I wasn’t the one to start the discussion.

If you want to learn more about the transgender experience, this was a good place for me to get educated:

https://genderdysphoria.fyi

It’s a bit of a long read, but if you’re curious about the transgender experience or community, I recommend checking it out; seeing as you are commenting on a trans sub about trans issues, it seems you are.

I appreciate your concern, but trans minors don’t need your protection from the treatment they want and need. They need your protection from hate speech, transphobia, and discrimination. Protection from people who would support LGBdroptheT (that sub got banned a while ago).

There is a reason the T is there, and always should be. The reason the gay rights crusade even happened, the reason gay men and women have the right to marry in the United States today, and the reason we have the Gay Pride parade is all because of the Stonewall riots and movement in the 70s, first started and led by trans women of color in 1969. Marsha P. Johnson is responsible for leading that movement that led to gay men and women getting the right to marry.

And yet, while homosexuality has largely been accepted, the fight for transgender rights has been a bit slower. 

Many people couldn’t wrap their heads around the idea of a man loving another man, because they themselves could not relate to those feelings. And we see ourselves fighting the same fight today. In the same way that a gay person does not choose to be gay, a trans person does not choose to be trans. 

You think I wanted to be trans? You think I want to be discriminated against? Why would anyone choose this?

That’s because it’s not a choice.

You probably don’t really care about my 2 cents - I’m just some random internet identity, a person hiding behind a silly name. In fact, that’s why I promised myself I wouldn’t “engage”, because while I like to think I could help someone understand, ultimately I’m probably accomplishing nothing, and looking like an ass doing it.

So I guess that’s all I really have to say. If you read this all, I’m actually really happy already that you were open-minded and cared about my opinion and the subject enough to do so. I respect that, even if we still disagree. 

If you’re still curious about transgender issues and experiences, feel free to PM me and continue to explore trans subs. I think that exposure is a good thing.

I’m going to bed now, thanks again."	mpftw9	trans	2263	0.96	2021-04-12 15:08:55

Call me “Good girl” or something…I need some happy energy		"Sweet girl, please tell her you ARE fixing your ""disorder"", it's called gender dysphoria, and she can either contribute something positive, or get out of the damn way.
Hey, Catherine. Sorry to hear about that. I really hope the rest of your day will be better!
Being a good girl is not a disorder. Being yourself isn’t a disorder. If anything you’re suffering a deficiency of good girl head pats.
You are a very good girl for actively working on the things you care about.
Don't listen to mom, listen to your heart. You're a good girl and your feelings are valid. I hope you have a beautiful rest of your day.
Awwws parents should love not drag down. Forget what she said and find a way to enjoy you for girly! -head pats- 😃
Hello Catherine! I like your wall of anime things and your outfit from previous post! Also your hair is very wavy and cute! Good girl :D
LOL!  Why doesn't she want to fix her own disorder?

You be YOU, girlfriend!  💋
You are a good girl, keep your head up! We are here!
Tell her you are, the ""fix"" (though the connotation of that words kind of feels icky) is transition. That's a proven fact.
Hey! Very cute name! ☺️ I have the same one lol, different spelling, I'm Kathryn, Kate to friends. Hope your day improves! 

Btw being trans isn't a disorder, it's just another human quality, like being left handed or having red hair. It may be complex but that doesn't make it unnatural!
U wish you tomorrow to be better, WAAAYYYY better❤❤
I know you know this, but you should hear it again.  You don't have a ""disorder"", you are beautiful, you deserve to be you.
You are valid!!! How is your day going otherwise? ❤
Hey Catherine. You being who you are isn't a disorder
You are beautiful. You are important. You matter. You are strong. You got this
it's going to get better, I know that to be true. You don't need to fix who you are as a person-- you're fine exactly as you want to be. Be you, and don't listen to her until she accepts that this is the real you. It's going to be better Catherine, you'll have good days soon, hun.
No matter what people in your life say, you’re an amazing girl, Catherine!
Good girl *pat pat* love you sis! 🥰😘
Catherine? More like CATHERINE PARR(History reference lmao) girl the only ‘disorder’ with being trans is the dysphoria, dont listen to her bc you are perfect! <3
A judgemental mother who doesn't agree with your life choices and is guilt tripping you into changing them?  Welcome to being a daughter.  You're just like every other girl that's ever existed. But hey, that's the point isn't it 😉.
Yo Catherine do you want a nickname?  

First couple of thoughts were Cat, Kit, Janeway, KitKat, and ""you there!"" 

If you do not want nicknames, that is cool too.
good girl cathy!!!! fuck ya momma
(but also rly sorry this happened)
Don't waste your time arguing with her, it only ruins your mood. She should fix her disorder
I’m sorry you had to deal with this. You deserve better.

You know who you are, and who you are is wonderful!
I’m sorry to hear about that Catherine, but you have the courage to come out to your family and that alone deserves some head pats you good girl! 💚
you are valid and awesome, don't let the negativity bring you down
You loved and accepted :)
I used to have that name. Twas a vibe but Rhea is more of one.
[removed]
You're an amazing good girl!
Catherine needs her pronouns respected. She is a amazing girl and nothing can change that.


(Did I get your name right?)
Catherine, you're a great girl and you ARE ""fixing your disorder"" by making your outsides match your insides.
Just say: i can curs my disorder, i just need

Feminine clothes, hormones and bottom surgery (optional)!

Also, good girl
Hey, where'd you get that name? That's my name! Come back here!

But in seriousness, your mom is completely in the wrong, and I hope you can get the care you deserve.
Hey Catherine, do you ever go by Cat? I always went by Kat. You’re doing amazing, girl. Your life is only disorderly when you aren’t expressing yourself—so keep it up.
Hi Catherine! I'm sorry you had a bad day girl, sending you lots of hugs! 

Couldn't agree more with u/cynopt \- you are taking the steps you need to help yourself. when you have the resilience, perhaps time to start asking why she's not helping you transition (but that's a big ask, and not always a safe one) - we stand with you xx (or sit, or kneel, or lie down!)
Just FACE IT, you will NEVER be a MAN..................

Just trying to draw from /r/AccidentalAlly in the hopes of cheering you up, you good girl. Keep on keepin' on! <3
I wonder do they realize, how harsh the words they spoke

Telling me I need to fix what isn't even broke

Why can't their narrow minds accept and simply let me be,

and respect my right to live my life, this life that belongs to me

&#x200B;

be happy and healthy sweet girl
Awwww... you seem like a great gal. Transitioning is the best, only and the correct way to truly fix your ""disorder"", just remember that whenever your mother tries to say stupid shit like this again. Catherine, you're incredibly valid.
i had a look at ur profile and i love your style so much!
I’m so sorry Catherine, you’re such a strong, good girl.  
Have a hopefully better week!
Hugs and love from this mum of a trans girl, lovely one ❤️
your mum can’t change the fact that you are an awesome person and a good girl :) hope you enjoy the rest of your day
Your a good girll🤗 *pet* *pet* Really tho my family doesn’t understand me or even the binary spectrum, either way it’s sadd but i’m still a woman just as much as you are and stay strong sis! i hope too god your situation gets better! Tell your mom your “disorder” is misunderstood by a lot and it makes you happy and is apart of youu hope this helped sending lots of luvvv🤍🖤💛
Hi, I'm sorry to hear what happened to you. You're a great girl, and you know that as well. Also, although it may be crazy to think now, but your Mom could come around. Stay strong baby girl. 💓
While I don't know you personally, I wish you the best day you could possibly have. You are a damn good girl and you have absolutely no ""disorder"".
Isn't transitioning the treatment for gender dysphoria
U don’t wanna fix it bc it isn’t a disorder! It’s something beautiful and to be proud of
Your mom doesn’t deserve you

As soon as your financially stable leave and block all contact
Hey Catherine! You’re a very good girl and you’re incredibly valid! 🏳️‍⚧️💚
Hey Catherine, I hope your mom gets more educated, and can be supportive of you. You're a good girl, and you deserve it Catherine!
Hey girl! Don’t fret. First off… Just tell your mother that first, and foremost , she needs to fix HER disorder. Yeah… 
Secondly, you are more than loved and accepted for who you are and how you want to live your life. Your truth is of the utmost importance. No one can live it for you. Believe me.. I understand the hills and valleys well, but it the end it’s your happiness that means the most. We LOVE you…❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋
Awww, babes ;----; I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you know that no matter what she says, you're a seriously good girl Catherine 🥰💜 get yourself some water cutie, hydration is important
Geez Catherine, I hope she comes around.

I'm otherwise very sorry to hear that is happening. You're a great girl and I wish your mom would accept that.
So your mom’s vision is clouded. 

Enjoy your life. Keep being happy. You do you.
Hai Catherine, you're a good girl and deserve all of the headpats!! *hugs and headpats*
Awww Catherine, I love you!
(Hugs)]

Very good girl! Do the best things you can for yourself! Shave your legs, wear your skirts (all at once for MAXIMUM gender euphoria!!! Lmfao). I accept and love you and your feelings are VALID!
Hey Catherine, beautiful name by the way, someday this will be better and you’ll feel safe and good with your body and the people around you.
Hi, Catherine. You’re dope. Your mom needs to fix her soul. I personally think you may want to fix yourself a tasty beverage or a nice snack.
You are perfect!
Hey Cat (if your ok with me calling you that), things will get better. Sure it will take some time, but it will get better, hopefully your mother and others accept you. Just remember that you have a lot of people to support you. And if you need someone to talk to you can always dm me. I hope you have a good rest of the year!
Hello Catherine, can't stand to hear about a fellow TRANS in pain... Although be it far from me, to question your mother's wishes, (she is after all) exactly that nor do I wish to create friction.But is my  belief that a girl who wants to be a boy, is Catherine s choice ultimately...btw Catherine, I was a boy, who wanted to be a girl, since 8! But it was my secret, couldn't let anyone know, was sure they wouldn't be understanding and would, disown me. They actually knew. So much I hope you can start, your TRANSITION early...as I did not start mine until 55!? At that point, 8 months ago there was NO question in my mind, (when I found out my medical insurance covered much of the procedures...THANK GOODNESS 🤭🥳) PLEASE feel free to text, whenever you like, if you want to chat Catherine...btw Great name👸
Colleen
No offense but f*ck your mother and anyone else eho says its a disorder im planning to be mtf myself...but as for you op""catherine"" ypu are a beautiful younf women your name is beautiful your art is awsome and i hope every bad or good day you have is filled with someone or a pet that will love you unconditionally because you are worth it you are worth that kind of love and affection and ik im only a random dumbf*ck on reddit but i wish you the best and if you ever need a boost or pick me up of happiness just dm me here or pm me and I'll do so for you😆
Tell her the truth, that the supposed ""cure"" for your condition, as approved by doctors and psychologists, is transition.
I'm sorry Catherine, I feel your pain.
I will do anything to make you happy, you are valid anyone who says otherwise is lying and they’re wrong, u gotta believe
I will do anything to make you happy, you are valid anyone who says otherwise is lying and they’re wrong, u gotta believe
Your such a beautiful girl you will break down the walls of gender dysphoria
You are doing great!
🧡Good Girl🧡
\*head pat\*
Oh no! Another Catherine! And I just dealt with the last 3!

Oh no not the nightmares again!
Daw, girl, thats so rough. I hope ur doing ok now
My favourite quote “It is okay to live a life others don’t understand”. Love and accept yourself that’s all that matters in the end ❤️
Hello fellow Catherine! After years of hanging around trans reddits, I've finally I've found my name-sister :)

Sorry to hear you've had a bad day, I work in retail and there's a lot of dumb going around that can't be blamed on the moon cycle. People are just getting weird. Just be mindful and aware of who's got the negative energy... Personally I just avoid those people. Hang in there <3 

If you need a chat or vent about parents (cuz I'd like to), feel free to PM!
You have nothing to fix, you are a powerful goddess. For it is YOU who is the secret power within your universe. Remember you are put on this world to kick ass and drink milk, so finish the cup already. Go get em, you got this! The force is strong with you 😘
Oh that mother fu....of yours. My partner is having the same problem with their dad. I am so sorry for you. She is missing out on having a wonderful daughter and a very good girl.
Good girl keep being your beautiful self (◕‿◕✿)
Oh God my doctor has the same mindset. You can't just like, turn it off or fix it. Glad my psychologist is leaning into it though and helping me explore it. Best of luck girl!
I’m so sorry to hear about your mother’s shitty beliefs, i think we all know how terrible it is to be around people like this. But you are beautiful and you are strong, you will get passed these awful times.
Be who you know yourself to be and tell everyone who tries to stop you to piss off :)
*hug*
Catherine is a very good name for a very good girl. Hope tomorrow’s better :>
Call me crazy; but I think we should fix your MOTHER’S disorder.
Good girl <3
wait my friend is trans and sometimes people with that name go by what he used to go buy (idk his legal name so theres a chance its Catherine)
Youre a good girl Catherine☺️. We are all incredibly proud of how brave and smart and beautifull you are.
Hey Catherine, cute name! Same as someone that's helped me a lot irl. Anyway you go girl, and hope you can move past your terf mum
Catherine my b you are the most beautiful girl under the sun
Good girl Catherine 🌸🤗
Head up, good girl. You ARE fixing your disorder. Keep your head up.
good girl
love ya sister
doing great girl
we love and support you for who you are!!!
You have unbelievable amounts of swag
I mean all you have to say is that transitioning is how you fix your ""disorder"". Because even in shitty archaic medical knowledge it is.
I’m sorry that she doesn’t understand. You’re a good girl and everything is going to be ok. Sending you lots of love today! 💕
Your hot 

Sorry if that's sound creepy
Explain you do want to fix it the only reliable way is transitioning
you are awesome, Catherine!!!
Hey, we learn to get over these kind of comments and people overtime, even if they come from a parent. I figured that out myself after 4 years. Glad you keep on expressing yourself, you go girl!
Hey sweetie I am so sorry yall are going through that. You're a beautiful young lady and no-one can take that away from you. They may try but be true to yourself and it will work out eventually
You are awesome, Catherine!

Being non-binary or trans doesn't mean you need to fix anything! You don't have to medicalise yourself to be valid. You don't have to pass to be valid. You don't need dysphoria to be valid. Transitioning is for you and ONLY you.
Being the coolest girl ever is a disorder now?
you are a gorgeous queen! you are loved and nothing is to be fixed. you are your genuine self and that’s all that matters. now keep slaying!
Don't listen to people who say that, also um where'd you get that pic made

I’m sorry about your mum. You’re amazing tho girl, don’t forget it
Your loved Catherine. We all support you! ❤️

I don't get being transgender.
All I get is that you're struggling with your identity.
But I know how parental disapproval can shake a person down to the very core of their soul.
Your identity isn't just yours, it's negotiated with the people around you. Any person disapproving, especially someone like a mother, makes your identity that much less secure and stable. And guess what, shaking someone's identity for your own comfort isn't exactly a good thing to do.
I don't know about you, so I'm going to assume that you're at the beginning of social transition.
Conservative people call young trans people gender-confused and in a certain sense, they are.

Because I can't imagine anything more confusing than not identifying with what you are, or maybe I should say, what everyone thinks you are. It takes strength to tell to people that you're unhappy with the identity they know. So congratulations, you passed your first character test.

You need counseling, but that doesn't mean your mother is right.
You're trying to resolve your identity. There is some chance that with time and proper counseling you'll detransition.
But don't let anyone tell you that this whole journey was worthless and you should have pretended to be normal and go to therapy quietly.
You're looking for support, and that's good. You don't deserve to struggle alone.
Wherever you'll end up after your journey even if you come back to your old identity, you're still much more of a person for having tried.
In the meantime, be a happy girl, if that works for you.
If your mother is convinced you'll detransition at some point, whatever. You deserve to take your time, as much as you need.


PS.
Detransition rate in the US is 8%. A typical conservative would be surprised it's not larger.
But I say, it doesn't matter. It may be 95% for all I care. 90% of startups fail, doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
Gender dysphoria is a medical issue, the only known treatment is transitioning, and prohibiting your child from transitioning is exactly the same as denying them treatment of any other medical issue. This is not said enough

These two said it better than I would've, but... Yeah that's what I wanted to say.

Keep doing you babe, you're doing amazingly well because you are doing you, not what and who people want you to be.
tbh, is not uncommon for parents to deny treatmemt for anxirty, depression, schizophrenia and ADHD as well.

And while autism is not treated and shouldnt be, diagnosis, accomodations and therapy in managing the life-impairing aspects and trauma is also often denied :/.
I saw this person's comment and had to look at your posts. They are 100% correct, your hair is beautiful! You're adorable and you have a lovely smile. The outfit with the black skirt suits you so well! 

I am proud of you. Learning about yourself and embracing who you are is difficult and scary, and I wish you much love and luck on your journey.
Vr project? Whats it about?
Alright, to me you are now KitKat.
Thank you for telling me

I’m sorry about your family, but I believe in you!
You don't need a family that doesn't love you. Because a family without love is no family.
I am so sorry your family isn’t supportive. You have to remember that it is them who have a problem, not you. I am glad that you are still happy!

Kind of rude all these people saying you're using faceapp like it matters if you are or aren't.  Glad you're happy though. Here's hoping you find a better one.
The arms scare me
The work you're putting into your look is excellent. Well done.
fuck their opinions sis, be the real you !!!!
Gorgeous
Oh, my god, you look so pretty.\~
queen you are so gorgeous. it's tough but you are valid
That's terrible about your family. If it's any consolation you look beautiful!
Oh my god you look amazing
You look Really Cute in Yellow.
I’m sorry to hear that. Families can be pretty mean sometimes. If it’s any consolation you are absolutely gorgeous. Stay happy and be proud Sweetie- you could be a model! 😘
You're gorgeous, I love your color palette.
Omg you’re so prettyyyy your hair looks so soft too omggg!!😭✨💗

Sorry they are not tolerant. You look incredible and be who you are. 🔥🔥🔥
It's pure jealousy, I'm sure, because girl, you are STUNNING.

You're beautiful, so at the very least you have that ❤️
You are gorgeous!! I hope one day you can find a family of non related people who love and support you, you deserve it.
Your a gorgeous woman now, give them time to adjust!
You look gorgeous!!!!!
That’s your family’s loss and the world’s gain. You’re absolutely gorgeous sweetie.
Well your our family now
U look so pretttyyyyy

Your family is comprised of fools and jerks.

You are beautiful, and deserve to be accepted and celebrated!
Your makeup looks like a filter

This isn’t ment as a insult btw
Screw them, we're your family now. I'm proud of you, daughter
it is common for people to hate women who:
1) are hot
2) do what they want

the hottest girls have had to transcend family limitations... this is key to the hotness

you are SO pretty, I see why your family is triggered, and sadly a lot of people here too lmao

babes are just controversial, cause a stir wherever they go.
HOLY SHIT YOUR FACE IS LITERALLY SO PERFECT HOW?
Not only happy (and I imagine you are also so courageous), but also you are unbelievably gorgeous!!!! Wow 💕😍
We love you
keep being you 💖
How foolish of your family to reject the divine grace that you are.

Beautiful babe😍Any Guy would love to have you on their arm 🥰
Thank you, I really appreciate that
Ring light and a makeup filter cuz I’m trash at makeup lol
So?? Who cares? I’ve used FaceApp to get that fleeting sense of euphoria to see myself with a beard. Like. We can’t all afford hormones and surgery. Let her have this, Jeeze.
Yeah you can tell if you zoom in
Isn't if you check their post history they have a video and pretty sure a gender swap filter aint work on a whole ass video [https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping-Advice92/comments/qgb47n/love\_this\_dress/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping-Advice92/comments/qgb47n/love_this_dress/)
don't you know ""I'm real when I shop my face""... get with the times
Lmooo thank you fr fr 💛
It’s actually a beauty and makeup filter and I have contacts in but it defs adds glow to my face…
Why be rude about it? So what if it’s filters or FaceApp?? If it validates her and gives her a moment of euphoria then let her fucking have it for Pete’s sake >:( there’s no rule about filters on this sub, and not everyone can afford surgery and hormones. This badgering is completely unnecessary and rude. We trans. We literally wanna be what we aren’t. Who tf cares?? If we wanna use an app to see how cool we’d be with the looks we wish we had, then that’s awesome! It should be validating, not something to be ashamed of! Sheesh.
Thank youuu💛💛
💛💛
lol it’s just a makeup filter and I have contacts but okay pop off ig
Idk tbh. Some self image nonsense lol
Whooo?
Ill have to pick one up cause you look amazing!
[removed]
I was about to say the lighting on the face was much different to the rest of the photo
You can tell if you have fully functioning eyes.
It’s not face app it’s just a makeup filter that covers dark spots. I also have contacts.
>We literally wanna be what we aren’t

We wanna be what we ARE. 

Also I agree with you^^^

**SILENCE,** transphobe!

EDIT: it worked. He was **SILENCED**
What is that Transparent thing under ur chin tho?

Edit:

UR PROFILE STATES THAT U USE FILTERS AND FACEAPP
I haven’t the slightest idea who that is
[deleted]
I do sometimes but not in this picture mostly my older pictures. The thing under my chin is how the filter reacts with my mask that I have on bc I tried to encompass my whole chin. Any other questions?
Nah I'm pretty sure it is just a makeup filter, if you look at this video you can see its the same person.

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping-Advice92/comments/qgb47n/love\_this\_dress/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping-Advice92/comments/qgb47n/love_this_dress/)
That ain’t my problem

My problem is that it is not stated in the post whatsoever it’s a subtle way of lying
Yeah… ur whole face and skull look very different if compared to older posts u made

Edit: German autocorrect ducked me up
[deleted]
I would blame that on the hair and bc in my older photos I did use face app so it changed low key lol. It is just a $10 dollar wig after all
I didn’t mean to sound… Calmed up?

I do not use any socialmedia except Reddit

I do not have anything against MTF I’m MTF myself

It just really pisses me of if people try to sell something as Real if it isn’t, and if that could harm people struggling with self doubts
So now I are using Faceapp and a wig

Why don’t u say that in the post title
Calling out everything you think is ""fake"" is at \*least\* as likely to be harmful.
Good grief *why* on earth are you trying to spread such ridiculous drama, negativity and awfulness.
I’m not using face app and a wig. Bruh how many times am I gon go over this😂 golllyyyy it’s a wig and a beauty / makeup filter. Yes as most filters do it does some shading and covers the mask. At the end of the day it’s still my face just with minor alterations.
It’s 100% fake and passing shit like this as real is bad for people’s self image. Selfish, inconsiderate thing to do.
I don’t wanna argue anymore 

Just be yourself okay?
And stand by yourself.
That’s my message
I’m working on it. Ion like how I look so I use filter. That’s it.
And that’s Completely fine 

Im sure you look good without a filter!
Just state it in the post. It gets ppl confused.

You look fantastic 🔥🔥
You rock that out fit so stunning
Absolutely stunning!
Your hair and makeup look perfect. And if this is your first time, you nailed it! What I find works really well for eyeliner pencil- just hold it against your skin for about 30 seconds. That warms up the pencil so the line comes out much smoother and faster. Also less smudging.
Giiirl you got shit on point 😘💅
the fuck how do you look like that teach me the ways
Oh my God you're so pretty, I wish I could look as pretty as you girl!
Amazing, awesome, and beautiful 🥰 I also love the results

I got it from h&m like 3 years ago and never wore it lol I was digging through my closet getting rid of stuff and found it today and was like I’m gonna make this a whole fit. It even has the cutest purse combo I’ll have to post the whole fit another time
Thank youu☺️
Omg yes! Practice makes perfect! Thank you so much!!!🥹☺️
😂😂😂
You have the facial features that i like the most.
Good to know! I definitely was on the side of caution when I did it since it’s my first time so I’m sure it could be more pronounced, but after a few hours of wear it definitly smudged out a bit and blended out
Oooooh that’s a great piece of information for the eyeliner pencil! It’s my first time doing this style before but it think playi g around with eyeshadow before helped me a ton
Na sis definitely not cis ☺️🏳️‍⚧️🌈🦄💩
I didn’t use a tutorial, but ill take a look and see if I can find anything that might help!!!
I get all my femme clothing from h&m it's like a godsend

Happy Friday!! I’m pre everything. This is my first time to dress as myself. Help tips are welcome. 💕		"No tips here, sorry. I'm just happy to see you on your journey!
You could try drawing your eyebrows on in a femme shape :)
Your smile makes me so happy and you have the kindest eyes. (Im ftx/m so not really good at the femme side for tips! )
Still to new for tips myself girl but good luck moving forward in your journey! And don't forget you aren't alone what so ever!
That dress looks so good on you!
ma’am your dress !!! i’m in awe you’re gorgeous !!! i have no tips unfortunately just admiration
You said you wanted advice? I'd say maybe try playing around with some makeup. Imo, eyeliner, eyebrows, and blush are some really important things in a makeup look. (Also, if you do this, make sure to put the blush up near your cheekbones, and not down on your actual cheeks) You look stunning already, so you shouldn't need much!!
Join r/translater and r/transtimelines. Also, as a photographer, I can tell you that if you want to look thinner, try to shoot from a higher angle down. Whatever is closer to the camera will look bigger and more emphasized, so just keep that in mind. You look great and I wish you all the best on your beautiful journey!
you look great! i'm so glad you're in the community! i love all of my beautiful people
nope no pointers no tips You looking fabulous!
You did an awesome job shaving! I can never get my body to look that clean.
You look lovely!
Gorgeous 😍
You could always invest in some false lashes or just mascara, making your lashes darker and visible or longer is kind of seen as a feminine thing and I think you look amazing!
I'm a trans guy, so I got no tips but you look so pretty aaa I'm so happy you're finally you!
Lovely!! Hope youre having a good night girly!!!!!
Wow! you look soooo stunning - love the natural look tpp! Can see you on the next front cover of Vogue!! Wish you'd post more!
i don’t have any tips sorry, just here to say you’re absolutely beautiful 🥺🥺
Ma’am I love your dress! You should try experimenting with make up and getting your eyebrows done maybe 

You look amazing
Just be yourself. Asking for advice helps a lot but just you do you! It’s a roller coaster ride out there but it’s fun and liberating! Go girl!
you have pretty hair and your super pretty and i love that dress on you, you rock it!!!
Looking great girl, keep it up.
definitely try experimenting with makeup!!! its so much fun to play around with and see which colors look best with certain outfits !! :"")
I’m a trans masc nb, but I’d say to just explore as much as you can. Don’t worry too much about what you ‘should’ be doing, just focus on figuring out what makes you happiest.
Also, YouTube is a great resource. I’ve found so many tutorials on how to contour your face to look more masculine, how to train your voice, body language, and the like. I assume there is an equally vast amount of guides for trans girls and trans feminine peeps as well
There’s one channel I found super helpful for my voice, and she has tutorials for voice feminization as well. You can find her channel by looking up Zoey Alexandria on YouTube
Beautiful and stunning!
Girl, you look amazing. Maybe try a bit of makeup, like around the eyes and lips and you'll be ready to model.
My goodness, that smile! So happy for you :) My only tip; try some winged eyeliner if you fancy it, it's been my go-to lately!
So happy for you as you start your journey! I remember back when I first started...I was terrified!

Reddit has been a really wonderful resource and part of the reason I’ve made it this far...everyone on these subs are just wonderful, helpful, and supportive.

Also, don’t limit yourself to just the trans subs. /r/MakeupAddiction /r/FemaleHairAdvice are both very trans friendly. Even if you lurk for a while like I did, you can learn so much.

Then don’t forget skincare and the wonderful people on /r/SkincareAddiction helped me develop a routine that was affordable and that worked!

Good luck girl...you got this! <3
Are your eyes hazel? Try some brown shadow if you're into make up! You have big beautiful eyes lids and can definitely show off some color.
You look gorgeous, love! Maybe start experimenting with makeup if you feel like that would help the dysphoria. Also, my advice is try out a bunch of different styles of dresses and wigs and see what makes you feel the most like you. Congrats on starting your journey! So happy for you.
An odd tip I learned as a trans male is men tend to hold their shoulders more up and women’s shoulders are more relaxed and sitting with like your legs crossed and together is a good habit to develop. There’s also a few apps that can help train your voice to be higher. A weird thing I’ve done to tell with mannerisms is to watch cid women and see how they walk, sit, expressions, etc to learn things. One more thing you look absolutely gorgeous and your tattoo is so pretty
You are just gorgeous! Im so happy for you.
Congratulations! You're aewsome!
Go get'em tiger ❤️
Looking very good, ma'am!
You're doing great! ❤️
i'm masc now but honestly a tube of mascara can never go wrong making someone feel better about themselves. Imo it's a small touch of elegance, yet noticable and very nice :) it also comes in multiple colors nowadays but black mascara is a classic!  You already look great, though!
1. I rlly like your hair
2. Your eyebrows are like faint and masc, so just do some makeup or smth idk.
3. Maybe a darker shade of lipstick? 
I'm not trying to be disrespectful or anything, I think you look great! But we live in a society so....
Good luck on your journey and I'm sorry if any of these tips are bad, I'm trying to use all my feminity on helping feminine people so hopefully there won't be that much left for me.
You look great. I am so inspired by you
If you’re interested invest in some good makeup and skincare. You can make appointments at the beauty counters in stores or at ulta and they’ll teach you how to do your makeup. Or there are a million tutorials on YouTube that have all the basics. Good luck and congratulations on being you!
Hey! You look incredible, and your smile is super genuine which is so special. 

Some tips: 
- A-line dresses look great on women who are wider up top than they are on the bottom, they’d accentuate your waist and hips really well. If you pair this with a flowing top (think pirate tops), and tuck it in, it would look SO cute. 
- I wear wigs a lot! I got some great tips from a cosplay friend. He said to spray dry shampoo on wigs and pluck hairs from the hairline to make it look more natural. It helped SO much. 
- heart shaped necklines would look incredible on you, and you can add another necklace to the one you have that hangs a little lower 
- not sure of your personal style, but I really like high waist sailor pants (they’re essentially wide leg flowing pants, SUPER comfortable) with patterned tops. that’s a fancier look but would look great out to dinner or just to wear and take pics in to feel fancy 
- for makeup, NikkieTutorials is an amazing makeup artist and has so many helpful makeup tutorials - she’s also trans and recently came out so she’s a really supportive and helpful advocate  

This is a lot, but you’re beautiful and if you want more tips, let me know!
You've nailed the hair so whatever you are doing there keep it up.like seriously, your hair looks great.
Here's a tip for taking selfies: hold your camera a bit higher so you are tilting your head slightly upwards. It generally results in a more flattering angle. 

For skirts and dresses, look for stuff that flares, it helps give the illusion of curves. 


Also squats. Do squats. All of the squats.
I don't know who you are, but sending my love ❤❤❤ (I suck at giving tips lol)
I get all my tips from queer eye 😅 you look great though!
A valid queen
This post made me so happy! Happiness is truly contagious!!
You need to start hrt ASAP. Orchiectomy will be very helpful
Unfortunately I’m an enby and I present more masculine so I have no real tips but you look gorgeous!
I'm not good in giving advice but maybe try a bit of blush? you already look absolutely gorgeous tho!
beautiful young lady. your smile is very radiant.
No tips but your hair is sooooo pretty
Aw sorry, i just find her body beautiful
No tips from me, but your smile is contagious!
Unfortunately you got some shadow from facial hair on you, I highly recommend learning foundation for that specifically as it can screw up absolutely any look you go for lmao
You look great!!! Also your smile is really contagious <3
I think you’d kill it with eyeshadow/top eyeliner and minimal eyeliner on bottom, help your eyes really pop! 

Can’t wait to see more!
Your hair looks so lovely wishing you the best on your journey :)
Absolutely stunning!
🥰❤️👍
You're beautiful sis!
I find it hard to believe this is your first time gurl, you don't need tips, you need to be giving them to others. This is gorgeous
You be you. Wishing you the best life.
We could all give you a hundred tips, but they all be useless if they are not in the direction of what you need.

Do when you look at the picture (/mirror) what does it make you feel? What do you want less of  what do you want to up? Want do you want to look like that is not the case right now? 

Itll give you much more guidance towards a look that yóú want to go for.

Otherwise people be just giving opinions and you know what they say about those...
dress and hair looks great and you look so happy!

i also haven't taken HRT or other medical transitional steps (personally don't want to, i love my body as it is,its other ppl that seem to have the problem with how i choose to live in it). 

as for tips what i do to help aquinate my femininity is try to bring attention to my eyes (masks being a thing pretty much everywhere has been a boon).i also use a lot of make-up tutorials that teach how to soften hard facial features for those of us that cant or dont have access to medical options.

hope this helps!
you have hair to die for, try putting it up and playing around with that, simple but effective, and honestly wear with confidence!!
You already look beautiful! I'd love to see you trying more outfits! There are so many other styles you could rock!
Looking beautiful and incredibly feminine considering you’re pre! I think you’d look amazing with some foundation and getting your eyebrows done!
Try not looking like a biker
Cheers to your health and happiness! You look great and happy!
seeing this gave me my daily dose of serotonin, you’re so sweet and pretty
Your hair is amazing!!!
No tips but I admire the lack of hair on your body! That will help! And that smile is great! I am pre but I haven’t posted any pics. Not brave enough. Good luck. You look great!
No helpful advice, sorry

But that dress *really* suits you

*eta you could pull off a really bold lip color btw
Just be safe! I live in a bad area for trans people, so I am just saying this to be friendly. Always be safe. Have a great day!
Just keep this same confidence.

No matter your age, appearance or size.. you're nothing without confidence.

I kinda like the natural brows, she reminds me of a really sweet English teacher I had as a kid. She has just such a kind face, I feel like the soft eyebrows contribute the look. 😊 Makeup is just so fun though! I'm sure she would look great!

A dress, too. It can be really hard for many trans people to be themselves, and thus to dress as themselves. There's lots of reasons for that - denial, fear of transphobia, etc
Thank you. I’m here to support you as well. You can can do this girl. Trust your heart 💜
Yeah I’m a firefighter and on our scuba team
Of course! I also draw— and would love to sketch this if that is ok with you? I sketch myself in ways that make me euphoric and I would be happy to the same for you. Let me know!

No problem. Good luck in your transition sweetheart!
I feel like a giddy teenager with you replying to my comment! When's the next post?
You’re very welcome
It suits your face so well, you look gorgeous with it on!
you did a great job putting it on i actually thought i was your real hair till you pointed it out, it really suits you and your stunning with it and your stunning in general
Blue is great, I have blue eyes too! Try some brown, it really makes your eyes pop!
I totally relate. I'm FTM in my early 20s and only began my transition a few months ago. I'm pre-everything and can't afford to buy the clothes I want to wear rn. Being trans is so expensive lol.
You look great 100% as is! You do not need work, you just haven’t been able to express yourself like you deserve!
Fuck those voices. 

With hormones and/surgery, and time 😪, feminizing will come. But courage.. confidence. That's important. 

And possibly a bit more helpful–often I get mistaken for a women by demeanor and body language alone. Next time you see an actress you like, or just another woman in public, study her posture. Adopt those subtle gestures into your own. And play with make up. For both; less is more.

Congratulations dm me please
Congratulations. My roommate is Transgender and she really wants to have the bottom surgery. Can I ask where you had it done? Also, how did you pay for it and what did it cost?
When you woke up and saw the bandages, were there any feelings of,” crap, what have I done “?
[removed]
Your such a lucky woman
Good luck!
Wow, what’s it like?
Congratulations!!! 🎉
Congratulations!!
Thanks 😊
Thanks 😊
Thanks 😊
Me too😆
Thank you, you are so sweet 💕
Thanks I appreciate it 💕
Nothing really, just make sure you don’t what they tell you to
Definitely ( the nurses keep commenting that my catheter bag fills up super quick)
Really, where are you getting it done, here in Montreal its required not to have electrolysis
aww thanks, but I haven’t washed/ put product in it in 2 days so its a mess
Vaginoplasty with cavity
It was only 6 months of waiting ( started the request aug 2022) and i didn’t need to pay for it as i am Canadian but ya I’m glad I don’t need to worry about everything that might stop me getting here
None, Montreal doesn’t require( and actually suggests not to) have and electrolysis done down there, there is a lot of misinformation about hair removal for surgery, I suggest reaching out to the place you plan on going to before doing any hair removal, they know best what works for there procedures.
So happy 😁
Had it done in Montreal, and as I’m Canadian, its covered through health care, so i only had to pay for home supplies and getting here
Not in the slightest, there was a feeling of “ its finally done”, but at the same time my brain keeps telling me I’m still waiting because it felt like the day was never going to get here, and now that its finally over, its having a hard time letting reality sink in. But I’m very happy that ive finally gotten to this part of my life😊
Get a life, spewing hate on the internet is a waste of everyones time.
Wonderful
Rest up and then take on the world!
Well thats good :3
I'm in California and they need it done before surgery so there's no risk of missed hair follicles growing on what is now inside my body. Expected to take 9-12 months but could be less if I can handle the pain.
Then your double blessed because that curly hair is hella cute! My nan called it the beach look, which I didn’t realize till years later just meant dirty! Lol. But seriously it looks super good! So I doubt your someone who “needs” the product, so if in future your feeling bad about not keeping up on the product and style side of things please know you do not need to worry about that because your hair pulls it off so well!
Oh, good for you!
Wow. I’ve been to Canada many times. I used to live across from Windsor Canada. My youngest daughter went to school in Buffalo NY and we drove through Canada to get there all the time. I wish the health coverage was the same in the USA.
Jealous…
I see, they just cauterize the hair follicles here so they want to be able to see them during surgery,
Thanks, but it really not much work to use product and also ive been keeping it in a hair bonnet to keep it from getting messed up
You will get there, i said the same to the luck ladies that came before me"	11l9ier	trans	2159	0.94	2023-03-07 19:58:50

Your mileage may vary but just make sure your hormone levels are right and you should be ok!
Thank you 🥰
Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️
Hahahaha well you are super duper pretty sooooo ya lol!!!!
lies! but I'll take it hehe, love ya Skye! <3
I’ve been on estrogen for 10 months and I really see no effects yet whatsoever but my doctor and I started out low dosage overtime the estrogen levels have been brought up to where they will start making changes in my body I cannot just walk into work one week with breasts and looking female I need to do it over time
of course! ❤️
Knowing your lighting and angles helps hehe
Thank you. That means so much to me.
i envy you girl, one day i’ll be able to get on hrt 😔
Hehe as you should!
Love you too cutey 😘
Ahh okay.
I started on a higher dose and the changes have been fairly consistent.
I’d say they haven’t been “fast” but it’s been fast enough.
I’m getting an Orchi I’m a couple of weeks to seal this deal for good hahah
Sure does babe 😉
Fingers crossed sis 😘
Wow I have not considered doing that yet but I guess one really never knows until One Comes to that point
Yeah, it just makes sense at a certain point.
Well I am so glad for you dear maybe one day like I said I’ll get to that point where I want to get rid of them it would make more sense when you’re trying to wear a bikini or you’re trying to wear a short skirt but at my age you’re not really we’re really short skirts lol
Well I guess older women can wear short skirts and show more leg it Just depends on how classy and elegant you want to look but with that being said I have to get rid of his beard and mustache I am so over having facial hair if they scream my doctor gave me doesn’t work then I will be going in for surgery laser hair removal"	q9w7hq	trans	2155	0.97	2021-10-17 10:31:12

It's so true and exactly what my Mom wanted! X
Thank you sweetie!! Xx
This is the most uplifting story, Sara! And i love your name! May i recommend this book to your adorable Mum: [Rebekah Robertson, ""About a Girl"".](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46201602-about-a-girl) I think your Mum might see a kindred spirit in Rebekah. It's the story of Rebekah's raising of her trans daughter Georgie. 

Funnily enough, i have a friend in the same position as your Mum, hence my hunch. Her son is questioning, and has been doing so since he was 10. He came out as gay a couple of years ago, and that seemed to help - he at least could crawl out of depression enough to go back to school. He was also extensively counselled by the Royal Children's Hospital Gender Clinic as his Mum - also a Sara - was concerned there was something and wanted it investigated before puberty. Those people's opinion was that he was not trans. Normally i'd be a bit wary of counsellors and trans kids but i have a great deal of respect for the wonderful people at the RCH Gender Clinic. Being trans myself some of the things her son says make me think, like his Mum suspects, that there is something more. But one can't push an egg to crack, but i think his Mum is nervous and i really feel for her. It could be a long wait, because we won't know for sure unless his depression really lifts if he really isn't trans.
Oops, Sara. My Step Sister's name is Sarah with an H.
That’s wonderful. I’m sure you stressed about it but in the end you worried for nothing.
Now you just need to find a sugar daddy to treat you like a Queen! 😉
Lol that's ok! I don't have the h because its easier to write in Japanese, which is where I live lol
Hahaha thank you and gosh I wish lol
I've always wanted to visit Japan. My friends Son lives there with his Wife.

Happy to announce my wardrobe is almost 100% girl's clothes!!		"Technically it is 100% girl's clothes because you own them. 😁
Yep, as soon as I came out my clothes were all girl clothes, mind you, I threw out all my guy clothes as soon as I came out
Awesome!! That top is wayyy too cute! 💕
Awesome and u look so good in them as well…. Think the only Guy things I’d keep is the hoodies since well I like hoodies haha
This is an certified epic
Ooh! That top is amazing. You look cute 😍
Your face is so cute! Love that hair style on you!
I am still incredibly jealous of your hair Jfkvkdkfk 😖😖

~ A pre everything transfem
clothes don't have gender! lol

so happy for you that your wardrobe is giving you all the gender euphoria!! love that shirt
Well I still like to dress like a butch lesbian so my 'male' clothes have a good place in my heart
I kept my band shirts and threw everything else out. I found an old pair of jeans the other day I must have forgot about, tried them on and they felt so weird...and wrong.

Pockets were amazing though.
You look so pretty!
Congratulations 🎊
Jealous 🫠
Congrats! May I ask how long it took you to switch from a majority-masculine wardrobe to a majority-feminine? Would you be willing to describe the process a bit, I.e., what did you buy first, discard first, etc.?
And you look gorgeous in them!
Wait you have closets, dang I have a dresser. Though that's pretty cool that you have that much girl clothes. I don't have any, or I think I wouldn't look good in them 😂.
Love this for you but please remember there is no such thing as “girl” clothes and “boy” clothes.
I remember throwing out like boxer briefs and feeling a huge surge of euphoria when I thought to myself “you don’t wear these anymore..”
You're rocking this shirt and it looks amazing, I wonder where you got form?







I wish if I can transition...
Nice 👍
Oh you look so good too! I can't wait to even hit the 10% mark myself. I've only got a few shirts.
Work it, girl! Ah-ooh-ga!!
Herzlichen Glückwunsch
Jealous of your hair and wardrobe hahaha but im really happy for you!!
Crazy thing, right, is that all clothes a girl wears are girl clothes 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
You look like you're trying not to smile you're so pretty and cute and wholesome and fashionable and and and--
So cute!
WOO! You go, queen!
There’s always some “boy” clothes in a girls closet! You’re beautiful and your wardrobe is perfect
Hell yeah sister! My wardrobe is now all my girls clothes only, now I just need to fill the empty space 🤔
:')
You go be your beautiful self
Yay! I’m so proud of you! 

I threw out almost all of my guy clothes when I moved a few weeks ago because fuck boymoding. (I kept some of the pants because pockets) 

It’s so freeing! I hope everything goes amazing for you :)
Mine too, because we're girls :)
you're so pretty i want to hug you so bad rn
yaasss gurrrllll!! im so happy for you!
Damn girl! You look beautiful! Dont let anyone tell you otherwise!
Yeah, but you're really pretty.  You can't not look good in either!
🥰
Cute 😍
That's amazing
You're gorgeous aswell
Wow😍
Wow! So pretty!
You are so pretty
Perfect decision 😍💯
Can’t wait for that day!  You are very cute girl!!
Cute!
Cute!
I wanna see your. Butt so cute
🤯!!!
There’s no way I’m getting rid of over ten years worth of collecting band shirts!
still need to boymode every now and then but soon!! 🙌
I can't find ""girls clothes"" work pants that are actually durable and most of the women in trades I know say to just wear ""men's"" work pants so... 

Which is funny bc my body is a VERY different shape than it was 3 years ago but I'm still wearing the same work pants and they fit me VERY differently.
Tip for anyone throwing out clothes: You can donate them instead (granted they aren't totally ruined and not underwear)
Tq!! Ruined me financially but had to get it 💖
Hehehe tq!! And yess hoodies are 4ever 🤘🤘
The secret is Chinese black bean soup, pass it along 🍲
Ey you're right!! And tq hehe
Sure! Took me about 2 years ish? I first bought stuff like jackets and sweaters to layer on top of my usual stuff, around the same time I started giving away half of my shirts (and kept the other half for boymoding). Kept stuff like jeans and hoodies, and now all it's just cropped tops and skirts HAHA
Too kind!! :')
💯
Literally me last year 🤝
From Hollister hehe 

And you defo can ✊
very soon 😈
vielen vielen Dank ✨
😳🤯
HAHA pls I'm usually bad with selfies and couldn't take myself seriously so I was stifling a giggle 😂😂
💖✨💖✨
Legit what they said, I've still got some old ""boy"" clothes just cause they're comfy, but they're still girl clothes because I'm a girl. :)

Hell I might even buy a guy's sweater sometime in the future if it looks comfy enough it's all about what you like and what you're comfortable with!
I have found a company here in New Zealand who have tradie skorts, Bisley I think their name is...I'm getting one for when I start my construction and engineering courses at uni (going back to uni in my 40s)...
I didn't throw them out, I did donate them, I only said I threw them out as a figure of speech
Worth it! Lol 😆
oh and your glasses! you've got a whole 🔥 look
Thank you.




I unfortunately can't transition (yet) considering where I live and everything surrounding me, so all I can do is wait for that day to come.
It's hard right now but I'll definitely make sure to live as my true self one day.

Same, i usually just flash a big ol toothy awkward grin like a shark lol

""How do smile, how do pose????""
So by this definition I have to be naked next time I travel through Tennessee. Since all clothes would be girl clothes and they don't like that
I just say they are my ""ex's clothes"" because I didn't specify what type of ex.  Ex gender, that is.
In my blind era 😎
Can relate, took me many years to get secure as well so please hang in there 🫂
Looks like Tennessee is in for a show. Lucky them lol

(CW) My dad has decided and now I will never talk to him again.	" 

I messaged my dad happy birthday trying to be nice and repair our relationship. But he ends up sending me this long string and this small tid bit that I'm about to show.

He said this to me. "" I don’t love you!!! I don’t know you!!!! Your a freak—a man that wants to use bathrooms with little girls!! A pervert beyond compare."" I just broke down crying at work and my makeup was running so I had to wash it off I'm just so tired of all this why is life so hard."	"That's horrible :(
OP, you have millions of people to comfort you here, we are here for you.
We will support you.
If we can help, we will.
I’m so sorry hon. I think it’s definitely within your best interest to block his number and try your best to forget about him. Anyone who would outright say “I don’t love you” to their own child is heartless. The battle of letting go of people you used to call family is definitely a difficult one. So surround yourself with people who WILL love you and support you, and stay strong sister!
That sucks. I'm so sorry. But at least you made the right decision and chose yourself and your mental health. Hope you can heal from this someday.
I am so sorry. I applaud your attempt. Shows how special and sweet your are. Love and hugs sister!
You deserve much more than your dad

If you need anybody I'm here to talk. ❤
He is not worthy of you being his daughter. You are the most important person in your life and no person in your past is worth a single thought by you since they want to hurt you with their words.
I’m truly terrified that this is what’s going to happen when I come out to my dad. Different wording, same end result…
Wow...I'm here if you need to talk. Just remember that you are beautiful, you are valid, and you are loved. _hugs_ ❤️
I'm sorry, any way I can help
I'm so sorry OP. I know it hurts like hell now, but you're better off without a toxic person like that in your life. I know it's far from the same thing, but there's lots of love to find here. If you ever want to chat, do some gaming, etc. Feel free to drop me a line. <3
This makes my hear hurt hun.  

You are so wonderful and deserve joys daily.  💜
That's terrible. It's his responsibility to be a better father and to treat you with the respect you deserve.

I'm sorry to hear he said those things to you. That was very cruel, and you deserve better than that.
Take my words with a bit of the skeptic's salt. I'm relatively new to this and to myself...

BUT,

I'm sorry. Your father doesn't deserve to know you. 

Maybe he rejected you -your identity. Some piece of work who doesn't know his own daughter called her a pervert. It sounds like he's the one in need of self-reflection. 

Don't let him make you feel bad. He has his entire life to come around and accept you for who you are, but that's on him and him alone. He isn't your burden to bear, so bear him no mind if he bears you no respect or recognition. Parents are supposed to try to understand their kids, to help them or help themselves to come around to who their kids become. He has failed. He may be a father but he's failed to be a dad. 

You on the other hand are still here. You've failed nothing. You showed yourself to him and you're still you despite that. Just be kind to yourself about it. It takes a lot.
he's just trying to manipulate you in a gaslighty way

he's not worth it

you're beautiful
Forget those people, I get it sounds mean and impossible. But life is not living for those that do not support nor love you. You should have love and support and find those that give that to you and not whatever he's doing that's the opposite.
I'm so sorry to hear that. if you need anyone to talk to I'm here for you. and so if everyone else on this sub. you always have support in other trans people. you aren't alone
I'm so sorry that this happened. I'm sorry to say this, but he's not worth talking to anymore. If you need someone to talk to, we all on Reddit would like to help anyway we can, or talk to a friend who cares and loves you for who you are. No matter what, we all, your friends on Reddit, your irl friends all love you. It's just your father is a jackass, and there might be a way for him to change his way, but if there is, it isn't happening soon. You're a beautiful lady, and you should be the best you that you can accomplish! We all love you, and there's nothing those transphobies can do to get rid of us! We love you, and hop you're doing your best!!
I'm sorry that someone who should be there for their kid wants you to live on their terms. You are absolutely beautiful, and you are worthy of the unconditional love a parent can have for their child. I'm sorry your father only loves on his terms. You are doing right by cutting that toxicity out of your life.
I’m so sorry :(
Family doesn't mean you share blood honey. I know the feeling of dealing with crazy/unwelcoming family members. Just keep being your true self and don't let anyone try to pull you from the path you've chosen to follow~
holy shit thats terrible
you dont deserve him OP, if someone cant accept their kids they dont deserve to be a parent
stay strong girlie <3
Cut him out!! I know it can be hard to do with family, but when they turn against you it can hurt the most. You don’t need that hurt in your life. 

You are a gorgeous and amazing woman in every sense of the word.
You deserve to be loved. He is in the wrong. I hope you feel better luv! He didn't deserve you.
As awful as this is, and it really is, this is an opportunity for you to mentally closure. You no longer have any reason to believe this is fixable, and you are free from trying.
One day he will be the one crying and realising what he has lost. 

Beliefe in you and your inner feelings! You're beautiful! <3
Your blood family is accidental, your found family is on purpose. We are here for you and you deserve unconditional love.
I’m sorry :( that’s really devastating. Reach out to me if you need ❤️
I'm so sorry. My dad did the same thing. We're here with you ♥️
I’m so sorry
I am so sorry you had to go through that. Your dad sounds like a hateful man who wouldn’t be happy with anything HE didn’t chose for your life. Sometimes even blood has to be cut off for your well being and happiness. He’s abusive to say the least.
Sorry, that really sucks. You deserve a much better father. I hope you feel better, and I hope you can take comfort in people who accept you.

I am also so confused, why do transphobes make everything creepy and sexualized? Has he considered that, by his logic, he is a man who wants to use the bathroom with little boys? Transphobes are creepy, and your dad's sexualization of minors is creepy.
Oh, fuck...

Rarely I have the urge to punch someone's face so hard. I'm sorry you had to go through all this.

 He doesn't deserve your love, you did all you could and was a genuine good person, it's his (and whoever spreads this bullshit) fault. You will be surrounded by people that love you for who you are in the future 💕 Cheers 💕
What a prick. Any father should except their kids no matter what. My son and daughter was gay and I was so proud of him
Parents who can't love their children for being themselves shouldn't be Parents.
Well last time I checked no “little girl” had problems with transgender people minding their own business
*short, angry, transfem screaming*
Aweee poor bean. Please be safe!
That person is not a dad.  That’s a sperm donor, nothing more.  You deserve so much more I’m your life and cutting out that type of toxic hatred is the first step.  You’ll find people who love you for the person you are, and I sincerely hope you never give another moment’s pause to that sperm donor.
There’s literally studies proving transgender people are born with the brain of the gender they resonate with. Your dad is fucking stupid and can’t even use the correct YOURE. You don’t deserve to be treated like that. Sometimes friends are stronger than family will ever be.
...God damn it, he's so harsh to you. He don't have the right to say that
MFers need to realise that it's never too late to die alone.
What a horrible and vile creature... You are a nice lady, I'm sure of it. It's his loss to be honest.
We're here for you girl, lots of hugs 🫂
I'm sorry this person is such an ignorant asshole. You deserve much much better.
Sounds like you did a very caring thing for your dad. I'm so sorry he doesn't understand. Much love going out to you darlin xxx
Posts like these make me wish I could reach through the internet and punch people. Someone like this doesnt deserve functional reproductive organs.
I am so sorry to hear this. As a CIS man and father there is NOTHING that any of my sons could do that would cause a reaction like this. We should love our children for who they are because they are part of us! Maybe over time he will figure this out.
You aren't a pervert you are just a woman you are entering the right bathroom and he was being wrong doing the wrong thing he's just a transphobic bigot.
I’m so sorry, sis—you deserve better. 

I usually offer r/beebutts at a time like this ❤️‍🩹🙏✨
Your Dad is wrong and life will teach him but by then it will be too late.
Get rid of this clown. He is not your dad.
It’s difficult with parents not accepting your transition I can understand your pain if I had came out as Pan when my father would have been alive he’d probably give a similar reaction thankfully my mom is cool with it. 

But I know many friends whose parents are not ok with their orientation and transitions. 

But it’ll get better trust me you just need to find friends and people who support your decisions in how to live life and be content with it
I’m sorry OP my father did similar things but there is a light at the end of the tunnel it just takes time. You can do this girl we all love you so much!!!!
We Love You!   We have borne your pain and tears.  We Love You!
Friends are gods way of apologising for family.

You DON'T need a dad. You DO need happiness. 

Go find friends who make you happy.

P. S. You dad's Fucking cunt... No insult intended to you, but every insult to you dad. Send me his pic so I can bitch-slap his ugly mush if I ever see it (joking... Honest)
Stop fighting for people who reject you. You can't win this fight. But you will suffer the emotional consequences.

You will make cuts from friends and family eventually (for a lot of reasons, that's just a part of life) and it is a good thing, because you don't have to deal with things that hurt you and that you cannot (!) change. Ending horrible things is a way to move on. Find a good therapist. It will save your life. In more ways than one.

I'm truly sorry. You don't deserve this. I hope you will realize this and I wish you all the best on your way to get there.
You took a bold step
What matters is you've come out. No more worrying about consequences or him finding out someday. He'll think about it too and you will be fine. We re all in this together. 😘 😘 🤗
Hey, at least if he never talks to you again, he can never say anything bad again! Just block him because not all parents are good parents
Only parents can say such cruel and hateful things. 

Some monsters seem to have a predilection to eat their offspring.

Stay away from this fucking cannibal. His words are unforgivable. No apology will ever cover the excruciating pain he inflicted on you. 

I am sitting here sobbing. I am soooo sad for you, sweetie!!!

I wish I could give you a bunch of hugs right now...
In my eyes, he isn't your dad. He may be your father, but he isn't a dad. No dad could say that. Only a father who is not a dad can. Fertilising an egg with sperm containing your genetic material makes you a father. Being a dad is different. He is not a dad. He is a terrible human being.
I'm sorry 💔
You have our support hun. I guess your sperm donor chose hate over love. Someday he will regret that decision.
Just wanna say as a 30yr old father I used to be homophobe but over the years and the tides changing and growing up and having kids i just realize I want nothing more for them than to be happy. It would hurt if I found out only because I'd know it'll be a hard journey for them in this judgemental world that i used to contribute to. What I'm trying to say is a good father will change his ways to love his children no matter what. You didn't lose a father, you gained insight that you never truly had one. Let it make you stronger and understand its because of the society that raised him before the changes took place, not because of anything you did.
I’m here if you ever wanna chat. That is a horrendous thing to say to anyone, let alone your child. Obviously it goes without saying, but none of that is true, and you truly are a woman(: Keep your head held high hun❤️
OMG...hugz
Oh the bathroom bullshit again. This isn't about you, this is American politics weaponizing transgender issues and you got caught in the crossfire.

Sorry for your loss.
It's okay. I can't tell you how it is from a trans perspective but ,as someone whose ""lost"" a parent through their views, you have to grieve but move one. Get support from those closest to you and never be discouraged for being your true self ❤
Yeah, some people are fed a steady diet of transphobic bs thinking that we're some mentally deranged sexual predator who want to peep on people in bathrooms.
Get away ASAP, you're worth so much more than your bigot of a dad
If he would ever say something like that then he doesn’t deserve to have a daughter like you why would he even think like that
Freak = telling your own child ""I don't love you""

In my experience the only way to deal with toxic people is to remove them from your life and only let them back in under your conditions. My dad never gave a shit about me but stayed away so it was easy for me to realize other than being screwed over it had nothing to do with me.
Your reddit family is here for you!! My PMs are always open
[deleted]
Your dad is a monster. 


You're absolutely fine and he's too stupid to know what he's talking about.
Dear dad you just confirmed my suspicions, you are an assh…e! Live your life because at the end you are beautiful you are loved 💕
So sorry to hear that. I eill never understand why people can be so cruel. But it'll get better.
I hope you are feeling better princess ❤️
[deleted]
So sorry to hear this
Girl you are better than this you are great and deserve the greatest life 
Don't waste your beautiful smile for toxic people even if it hurts sometimes at the beginning
Your father is a homophobic prick forget about him just remembered love yourself before anything else
Cut the extra weight and fly sis. We are here for you 🫂
That sucks. I’m really sorry. He doesn’t deserve to love you, you are too good for him. Me and everyone in this sub and so many other people support you.
I have no idea what to say. I can say that that is so fucked up that your own father would say that, especially after you tried to be nice. I can also say that it sucks and that although I haven't experienced major transphobia before my dad and I don't always see eye to eye, so I can understand what you're going through at least a bit.
I wish I could hold you in my arms princess
I agree this is not how you talk to your kid its sad but it happened . Maybe someday he will treat you with kindness and respect. Until then keep being you and leave the past hatred he did to you behind you
-hugs-
Hang in there and I hope it gets better for you not everyone feels the same as your Dad . Good Luck
That's awful! You know what, I'm your dad now! Just sign the adoption papers and you can message me instead of him anytime you need some fatherly guidance/love.
I will find him and then kick his ugly ass butt.
Be stronger sister ... hugz
First of all, *hugs*.

Second of all, DARN! Why do people have to be such arseholes? Especially to their goshdarned kids?

I applaud your attempt, but anyone who tells their child ""I don't love you"" is way beyond reasoning with. Hey, at least he's blunt and honest, so you at least know to cut him out immediately. Still, I hope you are okay, it must be shocking to hear that from your bloody dad of all people.

You are better off without him. Hopefully you have people you can turn to.
Sorry to read this. Family are the ones you need the most for support!
Oh my god, I'm so sorry for you... I don't know your dad but this honestly sounds like he isn't worth the effort. How can someone say such things to their own child??

Also, his argument with the bathroom doesn't make the slightest sense. A cis man who uses the men's bathroom is in there with little boys, too. And, I mean... as long as an adult person doesn't follow children (or other adults) into the bathroom stall, I don't see anything wrong with it. When you're outside, shopping or whatever, you're in one room with little girls or boys, too. Why the hell does it make a difference if that room is a bathroom or not? If someone REALLY is a rapist, I think they don't care about the surroundings that much. In a public bathroom, you can just as much be alone with another person or be surrounded by other people as in many other spaces! I honestly don't get what's the big deal with bathrooms and genders... ugh. (And, of course, you AREN'T even a man!)
I'm so sorry
Your dad is a POS.  NO parent should EVER tell their child that.
What happens to people’s humanity that they will betray their daughter in such a way.

You deserve so much better - you deserve a family that loves, accepts and celebrates you.

I’m sorry.
What man baby, you know you’re a failure of a man when you can’t even be a supportive father to your trans kid, and make it about yourself instead by projecting your own sick insecurities. You’re dads a creep, and I hate anyone that wants go out of their way to label someone as a predator because it has nothing to do with other people and everything to do with him and his sick, neurotic, immature hatred. Sorry you’re a child dad, sorry you could never be man enough to do your job and part as a parent, you waste of space, please die alone  with your bitterness and immaturity asshole. You have one job, loving and supporting your kid, you can’t control who they become in the end, and it’s not your decision to make either. You’re dads a narcissist, and I hope his bday was extra shitty with that text message. Also, I’m sorry you have deal with an absent dad, it’s not fun. I can surely empathize, but you’re strong, you’ll make it out better and stronger in the end. Keep on being resilient, keep on being your beautiful self and don’t worry about the rest.
do people's morals just disappear enough for a POS father to put down his own daughter like that?

I'm appalled and somewhat disgusted that people would do that

I'm so sorry you had to go through that
Sorry this has happened to you. Mine has spent the last year not calling me any actual name as his ""compromise"" between not using my no longer legal dead name and my actual legal new name.

I know if I pushed him he would come out with something similar to yours.

So currently I just don't see mine and don't ack any message and have changed his name to ""."" in my phone lol ..

Deep down though, it is not funny, and it is just a matter of  time (and me doing some actual contact) until he comes up with one of his world ""pronouncements"" on me .... and then I will be one more child out of his life ..

So big hugs to you .... you totally cannot be resonsible for how parents behave. I am a parent and would never behave like that, no matter what. 

Good for you for trying to reach out as well - again not you fault it got rebuffed.

In a vague attempt to add something happy - it did make me smile when you said your make-up ran - at least you are being true to you !!! And life can ask nothing more of that from you xx
1 thing to do rn... ghost him forever untill he apologises
i’m your new dad. i’m adopting you right now. we are going to go get ice cream and go shopping and play video games together, and you will be my fucking amazing daughter and feel fucking loved.
Your dad is an emotionally stunted and ignorant man child. I'm sorry for your loss
Did you respond??? I think I would respond saying how wrong he is and how indoctrinated he's been, and then I would never speak to him again.
If you need a replacement parent, hit me up, I'm always down to talk
Fuck him. Atleast we can be your family now :) and i don't get the little kid part, little kids go into the boys bathroom too but somehow you can only be a pervert in the girls bathroom?
So sad people actually think that trans people are predators :c We're just trying to live our lives in peace. So sorry you had to hear this OP 💔 You deserve so much better, I hope one day he understands and supports you
Oh honey. Idk how people can be so cruel. Know that you have support here. As little as it means, it's at least something.
Your dad will regret his words when he finds himself alone and no daughter to love him. Time will show him how wrong he was
Speaking as someone who hasn't had contact with their parents in almost 8 years, it sucks sometimes that you can't have them in your life, but once they're out of your life you can begin healing. I am the best, healthiest, strongest, and happiest I have ever been because I keep good people in my life and have cut out toxic people. If I were your dad, I would be thrilled to have a daughter like you, and I would be proud of you for living as your most authentic self, actually I don't have to be your dad to be glad that you have the strength and courage to be your best self. Sending you hugs.
Fuck him he doesn't deserve to have someone as loving as you are, as they say you can't argue with dumbasses just let them have their way, i understand how it is to have unsupportive parents i would love to have a supportive family but you know not all of us are lucky
I’m so sorry he is behaving that way. You deserve so much better. His inability to grow as a person and listen to your experience in no way reflects on you. You have outgrown him.
To that end, he’s the one that’s tormented. 

Needless to say, but anyone that attempts to tear you down is projecting upon you.
Hang in there.
if i were you i'd go full scorched earth on his ass in response to that disgusting display. Fully ruin his life.
I'm so sorry do you have to go through this he loves you he just doesn't remember please don't be hurt he will remember one day the only answer is unconditional love
I'm so sorry. It's bizarre people believe those things.  And then they'll claim we are sheeple.

I feel your pain.  My dad told me I was confused.  After he spent the majority of my developing years in prison.  I've thought about reaching out to him recently.  

It hurts to realize and give up but you don't need or deserve that.  Sending love 💕💜💕🍓
If he's like that it's really for the better.  You need people who will support you and love you for you. :/ I'm seeing this at an interesting time. In a couple hours I'm talking to my therapist about coming out to my dad. I've been thinking all week what will happen when I do. So thank you for sharing. It's helped give me insight on possibilities.
I wish I could reach through this technology and hold you and cry with you.  I was born into an impoverished matriarchal culture with a mother who supported me all the way.  My spouse was born into wealthy patriarchal culture with a very abusive mother.  My mother welcomed my spouse into her family as another daughter whilst my spouse’s mother only increased her abuse and tried to abuse me as well.  We banished my spouse’s mother.  

You can’t reach a closed mind.  You can find a loving family beyond the bonds of biology.  In my culture I’m considered a holy person because I’m a trans woman.  My spouse and I are in a lesbian marriage.  Although my mother has left this life, I carry her spirit and share it with my friends and family.

It’s healthy for you to banish the people who reject you and torment you, and welcome the people who honour you for who you are.  First, give yourself the opportunity to feel the hurt and know that we feel it with you.  Next, honour yourself and the people who support you with their acceptance of you.

Those people may evolve into the family who you truly need.
You can never fully not care about your parents opinion, but you can understand that their bigotry is more important to them than you and that it is more mentally healthy for you to separate from them. My mom made the same decision as your father, and while there have been good times, my mental health won’t be able to handle her when i start HRT and other feminizing procedures
Jesus, I'm so sorry... That is awful. The community is here for you. *Hug* <3

Makes me wonder what my dad would say. I haven't spoken to him in years.
That's awful how dare he mess up your makeup
Honey, as had as it is, you need to get to a place where you can accept that he has thrown away the right to be in your life THROUGH NO FAULT OF YOURS and let him go. He sounds like a very sick man, but it isn't your responsibility to make him well. Take care of yourself, and your heart. That needs to be the focus.

*Hugs*
It’s hard, but you made the right decision cutting him out, parent or no you don’t need heartless bigots in your life
This must hurt very bad...You were so kind and you shouldn't regret that. life is hard sometimes and I can't anwser why, but you sure have my biggest hug and support sister🌸
[deleted]
How about you make your dad meet my baseball bat?
[removed]
My biggest fear. Sorry to hear that but mabe he'll realize he's wrong someday.
I wish I could give you a big physical hug. I am so sorry.  You are valid.  Certainly not a freak.
That really sucks. Hopefully you have a strong friend network to lean on. I would still suggest going to a counselor.
🖤♥️ *hug* I'm so sorry
Yikes what a POS. Should’ve never had a child if he wouldn’t love them unconditionally. 

Well you’re better off without him.
Im so sorry honey, I wish I didn't understand and that this never happened to you. I am here for you if you need to dm
I’m so sorry. He’s not worth the time of day and that’s not your fault at all. I wish I was with you in person so I could hold you. But I’ll still tell you: 

It will all be okay. People reveal who they are in unexpected circumstances. Your sperm donor revealed himself to be a monster. He’s missing out on getting to know the real you. As for you, it’s better that you don’t have him in your life because that is not someone worth keeping in it.
I’m so sorry. You don’t deserve that. I hope you find your true family sooner than later.
O hun sending hugs 🫂
baby I'm so sorry <3
I am so sorry this happened to you. At least you were doing your part tho. You were the good daughter by wishing him happy birthday you met him half way. If he didn’t show up and do his part that’s on him. You are no freak and only time will prove to him his way of thinking is wrong. Big hugs and I hope you continue to shine and sparkle. Xoxo
I know it’s unlikely that we can make you feel any better but that sound like they are lashing out because they don’t understand. We’re all afraid of what we don’t understand. But obviously that’s not why you are doing any of this. Don’t let their confusion and pain dictate everything. Be strong sister!
I feel you… You’re not alone on this though. 
I’ve decided to cut ties with my dad just this Sunday. 

He came to my church between services (which I still actively volunteer as drummer and lighting director. The pastor also knows I’m in transition and still openly welcomes me to serving.) just to tell me how much he disproves of me “trying to be a woman”. And kept referring to me as (I kid you not he used emphasis on this….) a MAN. a HANDSOME man. Then quickly switched  into how would this screw up my kids? About how they’d be bullied because their *father* thinks they’re a girl?… 

I’ve never cried on stage before. Until this past Sunday. 

I’m sorry our dads are dicks…. Yours seems so much worse though FUCK him. 

* apologizes in prayer for swearing 🤣
Sometimes it's best to leave toxic, non supporting people in the dust in order for us to shine our brightest. Keep your head up girl ❤
I’m sorry that your dad sucks 😢
Had to give this a wholesome reward
What the actual fuck! That's horrid, he was never good enough to be your father anyways, you're so much better than him and if he wants to act like a child then let him, you deserve so much better than that pos.
As a parent I could not imagine saying this to my child, it's so cold
I’m so sorry. Hard day indeed. After you tried to be kind. I wish you well. 🙏
My uncle doesn't talk too me because I'm pan sending much hugs and love :'(
That’s horrible! But he’s not a dad if that’s how he feels he was just a sperm donor…

My not a dad was a dad when I was a boy but at 33-34 when I transitioned he called me disgusting, I replied “that’s not what the men say when they’re screwing me!”  I think I broke him back! I got the last laugh and cried…
Just because he's your father doesn't automatically qualify him for your respect. That has to be earned.

I'm not saying it doesn't hurt like hell to be rejected. It does. 

But you will find people who respect you for who you are, not who they want you to be.
I am so sorry, I’m not trans so I can’t even imagine how difficult this is, but if my dad ever said anything like that to me it would break me. *sends virtual hug*
Have a Great Sunday

Hey, you're showing your thing in front of little kids, don't you think it's not normal and something no one should do? Stop finding reasons for your sickness to be accepted.
No matter what He says He still loves you He will put this behind Him .. Hope Soon Have a Great Day

I‘m sorry but your dad is absolutely right, you should seek mental help.
I‘m sorry but your dad is absolutely right, you should seek mental help.
Does your mom know he said this?
Im so sorry. If it means anything my dad's a piece of shit that I assume would respond in the same way. I don't know though because he's a piece of shit and doesn't talk to any of his kids lol. You know what? It's better this way. At least it is for me. The thing with being trans is you get to see who the good people around you are.
fuck me that's horrible... what a fucking dick, such a shitty thing to say to your own kid. im so So sorry that this happened, just know that we are here for you. your father might not support you but i know this community will. its going to be ok, best thing to do is just cut ties with him. people like that unfortunately seem to never change there tune. 😔 

sending good vibes and much love your way 💗
If that's what he thinks, then he's right in that he has no idea who you, his own child, are. The rest of what he said shows his character, that he loves and values his daily hate porn more than his child(ren). For that reason, he's not someone that should be trusted around children. 

You stay strong. NC isn't easy, but know that you've done the right thing. No one will fault you for escaping such a gormless, hateful beast of a human.
What an asshole, dont listen to him he doesnt have a clue what hes on about and is clearly a scared sewer rat
No offence but your dad sounds like a total idiot lol
Don’t listen to him he’s just stupid
[deleted]
🙁😓🤬
that is a truly horrific thing for a parent to say to their child, i'm so sorry
2 words: his loss.
my number one fear, that's so awful. I wish you the best of luck dealing with your situation. remember that there's nothing wrong with you :)
So sorry to hear that. Hugs ❣️🏳️‍⚧️
you have family here now.
I’m sorry that man is a hateful loser and makes no attempt to hide it.

As a dad to a trans child, I can’t imagine how somebody could fail so colossally at the easiest part of being a parent, which is to love your child unconditionally.

If you ever want dadly advice, my inbox is open.
thanks Dad ... lol you have the same name but your way better than him :)

🤗
Sis, you're definitely not alone. 

We got ya girl! 

Much Love!💜🏳️‍⚧️
In my experience, Chosen Family is better than blood family.  Chosen Family has deliberately made a decision to be with me, while blood relatives are just there by default.   


\*>>HUGS<<\*
Yeah fuck that dude tbh. I can't imagine losing your dad like that but I have a brother my entire family has cut off because he was ""red pilled"" and it sucks. We miss him but we mostly miss who he was before his mind was corrupted.
killing a person that never existed is extremely absurd
You will live long whilst he mourns by the side of an empty grave of his own creation.
Yeah, the family you make will always be better. I’ve had to cut off my family before, but this one will hurt because for the first time in my life we have a decent relationship.
well then heres another (>•-•)>
Most of the multi-player ones have kinda been languishing because I've been hitting Cyberpunk 2077 pretty hard. That said, when I do take a break from that it's Lost Ark, New World, Warzone (COD is a guilty pleasure), or Civ 6, though I'm never opposed to checking out new ones or returning to a few classics. :)
Good! Sounds like you know what's up :)
Thank you. I try to be. But I will except anyone whose parents dont like them as my children
He's wrong, you're not a ""perverted freak"" or what the hell he said, you're a good person
He’s going to waste away his life on hating then regret it
That’s a very healthy thing to do
♥️
Oh fuck ya
No problemo, hopefully one day he'll reach out and apologize to you, and accept you as his daughter, but until then, we're here for you
I'm in my early 40's and my dad has the same level of understanding about stuff. Wish I could say it gets better but all I can say is heaven and hell are at your elbow and the choice is yours.
That’s a great way to look at it!

Family of choice is the strongest family their is! I hope you’ve found yours, or will soon find it!

(Also; I see the Savathûn body… love her, she’s excellent 😁)
Yesss girl<3
As it should be <3
he loves me in a fucked up way that is conditional ur right it isnt unconditional love at all
I agree. I try to. And thank you. I'm going to soon but I'm super nervous about it. 
💕
That's even worse I bet it was cute
[removed]
 🫂🫂🫂 yes definitely his loss.
My in laws are the same way. I’ve been back and forth through that Bible (I am a Christian) and there’s not much, if anything, on this. People don’t like Sigma’s because they don’t make sense.

Anyone who lives outside the normal structures. Be the true you!
I’ve been with this specific church for about 20+ years now that I think about it. I started as a drummer since I was 6 and kinda grew with them as they got bigger, then smaller. Then slightly bigger.. we call this place the worlds smallest mega-church 😂. But yeah the pastor has an understanding for the LGBTQ community and sees absolutely no reason why that should stop anyone from serving in the ministry. But hugs back to you sis ❤️
Np, don't worry, we all love you so much more than he ever will
Just keep putting positivity out in the world. ✌️ and your welcome. We all got to stick together

Was this not a joke?

Wtf me? Wtf you! I never knew it was a „thing“ people not „knowing“ if they are man or woman. Thats always been and will always be a kind of severe mental illnes.
aw thanks <3
It's like they say, ""the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb""
thanks Hugs\*
aw yea it can be tough
yes it is
yea i get that i was working on my relationship with my dad until i came out
:) <3
I play cold war but i can play some warzone
Aw thats sweet ♥️
Aw thanks ♥️☺️
thanks <3
he is a big baby afraid to look girly
thanks yea my dad sent me like a copy and pasted from a website and its like the bible doesnt mention trans people or intersex people so like
♥️
Cuz i dont like balding or cheat or back hair leg hair arm hair or masculine features
No it wasnt
Um no idk about u but i dont expose myself or try to look at ppl going pee
I dont like it the way it is so i have to change it to he comfortable and happy how would u like it if u had tits as a guy
Says the transphobe
Oooooh, I like that phrase! 💜
<3
I play minecraft if u play that? I'm trans mtf as well but only 14 🙂
Remember that you are a strong young woman and have the power to do anything you want. I will support you
Yeah, I know that might sounds low-key weird because we don't know but... I'll be there if you need some moral support, you'll always count on your friends to help you, don't forget that
You're welcome :3
[removed]
Oops
🤣🤣 whats that now?
Unfortunately, people have twisted it to mean the exact opposite by just saying “blood is thicker than water”
Thanks it isnt weird
Yea they do ☺️
You. You’re the transphobe
Yeah, super disappointing that people use that phrase that way. It’s so dumb.
Thanks, and don't forget.... Do ya thang
Nope, i don‘t have any issues with my gender.
I didn’t say you have issues with your gender, I said your a transphobe
Please read again, you are saying i‘m a „transphobe“ so you are implying i have doubts about my gender. You have severe issues man, get checked! Also some kind of attention deficit disorder i can see.
Someone doesn’t know the difference between transgender and transphobe
Wow this is really crazy, but well it‘s Reddit. Lots of crazy people here, hahaha. Next day i may find people who are not sure if they are dogs or trees 🤪
Still don’t understand the difference between trans and transphobe
I think you have adhd
And you still don’t know the difference between transgender and transphobe
Mate, they aren’t saying you are confused about your gender. What they’re saying is that you’re transphobic. What that means is that you disapprove of transgender people. It doesn’t mean you want to be one. We can all clearly see that by how you’re acting."	tjqyb0	trans	2113	0.98	2022-03-22 00:58:13
3 months on HRT, License changed to represent my true self, and a gorgeous (even if it is sweltering) week here in Seattle. 🌈 happy pride month 🖤🖤🖤		"Looking good, and I also love your tattoo!

(sad, sweltering fist bump from Seattle)
Glad to see you survived the heatwave! That was a nightmare!
[deleted]
UR SO PRETTY
[deleted]
You are literally goals 😍😩
Cute 🥰☺️

Age? I love what HRT does for us !!! 🙏🏳️‍⚧️
Congrats!! The weather isn’t the only gorgeous thing in Seattle today. Happy Pride Month!!🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
You look great!!
You look like the vampire lady from the new resident evil, thats awesome
Happy pride! Looking great 🏳️‍🌈
Absolutely Stunning!
Just to verify, in Washington you just declare your gender at the DMV right? My name change court date is end of July and I want to be prepared. The courthouse gave me a form for license gender marker that looks like it might have been out of date since it required information from a doctor.
Omg you are gorgeous ahhhh heat wave sucked, but I accidentally was in a park for 7 hours because a pride meetup descended on my meditation spot! Heat wave defeated by gay friendship!
MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤️💫❤️
YOOOO WHERE ARE MY WASHITONIAN SISTERS AT?... I'm stanwood
I just left Seattle on Saturday lmao
You look amazing!!!
Congrats
Woh! Girl you look AMAZING! I'm 4 months in but pretty much boy mode... Do you have some tips for me?
Hello goddess
congrats that’s awesome! you’re so pretty, goals goals goals 🙂
Ok you are absolutely stunning and straight up GOALS! also I love that dress!
You Look Amazing Girl!! keep giving us updates on your HRT. Kisses From Atlanta!! Happy Pride Month!!
Sure looks 🌡️😎❗Great for you...I recently did the same♀️on my CAID...so awesome! Been on HRT (5 months now) MTF ,Enjoy...
Thanks! I got it done at Hidden Hand Tattoo by Jeff ❤
Never noticed that until now it's my friends place 🤣🤣
'cause our community is in distress due to a wave of reactionary anti-trans backlash.
Hot Topic 😄
Dirty 30 😈
You're too kind 🥰
My friends say I dress like Im in AHS Coven 🤣🤷‍♀️
At least in king co thats all you gotta do. I was born in Arkansas so I gotta have an orchiectomy at min to change my birth certificate. 🥺
Good timing 😝
Everybody is so different that everybody's journey will be very different so what works for me may not for you.  Take your HRT, stay hydrated, wear the clothes you wanna wear, speak however you're comfortable. Most importantly remember that you are valid and beautiful.
Taking note for when I inevitably return to Seattle.
Gotcha, DMV/DOL rules should be state wide so I should be good then. I hear you about birth certificate though. I was born in Oklahoma so I gotta get a gender change court order but I'm struggling to find out how since it doesn't seem like Washington does those. I'm probably just going to get passport and SSA done to start with after my driver's license.
Seattle was a fun 2 week trip. Did a bunch of hiking, plus the pride flags everywhere were very heartwarming
Awww ty for this cute message <3 and you betcha I'll be taking my HRT! Cant wait to finnaly go trough life as a woman, but it's still proves to be quite a daunting task unfortunately. But hopefully as time goes on I'll be able to see the woman I am :)"	oakal2	trans	2105	0.97	2021-06-29 23:29:44
happy new year. i’ve now been out for a year but i feel like i’ve made no progress		"So cute ^.^
If this was truly what you looked like a year ago (I know it’s a now selfie, but you said you’d made no progress). You had/have an amazing starting point for E to work it’s magic!

What is it about your transition that makes you feel like you’ve made no progress? And, if it’s physical looks. How long have you been on hrt with cis female hormone levels?
IDK, you look pretty fem to me, do you have a pic from a year ago? Really, if I saw you on the street, my first impulse would be that you are definitely a woman.

Also, cool profile name, we actually raise ducks to sell the eggs.
Girl some of us would kill for a face like yours. Hrt would only further help you pass. Like I’m jealous! The hell is hrt doing for me cuz I’m 2 years on and still don’t pass
Damn girl, you're cute as fuck and have triggered the lesbianism in me!
No joke I literally thought you were afab before I looked into the comments section and your profile. You look damn feminine, ur really cute and your hair - girl, I can't. It's really amazing.
You honestly look like you could be a Chloe Grace Moretz impersonator, professionally. I would have assumed you were AFAB if it were posted in a different subreddit without the trans flag in the background.
Much love
Happy newyear ✨
Take further steps towards what you see a woman to be or the end result for yourself. Get some cute clothes or practice styling your hair and stuff. Even if you feel like you're doing it wrong keep doing it because you'll figure out how you like it done.
r/TransDIY
I thought you were afab going ftm, because you said no progress. You fr look like a cis woman to me. I know dysphoria makes it hard to trust our own appearances, but you are doing just fine.
I was mindlessly scrolling and didn't see the sub your picture was posted in but stopped and thought ""huh she's really pretty.""
im not one for fake compliments to make one feel nice, i only say things i truly mean in my heart

and girl, motherfucker, you are not only beautiful but if i saw you on the street i would assume you were a girl, like AFAB implicitly 

happy new year!!! get on hormones!! if you want that is. my doctor when i had one wasnt scary at all, i just owned myself. but i get it, i dont have a doctor anymore cus i couldnt afford it, so i diy. you should try doing it yourself mayhaps.

estrogen is literally magic like i dont pass and even if i never do i just NEED the estrogen to be okay like holy shit idk how i can even state this i tell all my cis guy friends they should try it cus its so fucking good for the brain lololol

<3
What kind of progress or are you talking about?
Looking good! Don't give up, you look great! Happy new year!
You're so pretty!! Hope the new year treats you well and that you make progress with your transition❤️
Happy new year you too. Keep going . Even if you not see any progress you are making one, I believe in you
you remind me of a classmate I once had, she was very nice
Happy new year
Your very beautiful 💕
You’re so pretty!!
Happy New Year. Stay strong
waking up everyday as yourself is progress <3
It’s okay to feel like you haven’t made progress… I saw you said you aren’t on hrt and that’s okay.. I’m actually in a similar boat to you, because I’ve been for over a year (august will be 2 years) and I am haven’t made any transition steps either.. it’s perfectly okay to make slow progress, especially cause we don’t know you irl.. but don’t worry I’m sure once you get there you’ll know.. and it’ll be one of the best moments of your life
Your face reminds me of Florence Pugh ! 💜
I'm so jelly how good you look. Crazy to think ur not doing hrt yet.
You look adorable!
You look gorgeous! 🥰
You look great though
Girl you gorgeous
Cute😊 i like your lips alot👍
You look like hit girl! Honestly, you could rock that cosplay!
Happy new year girl! Same here 1 year feeling no progress... you're not alone lol 😬😱😭😁
Looked up your earliest picture, and your title is somewhat right. You don't really look much different from last year, but that's not a terrible thing. You genuinely look great and it feels like you're trying to go from a 95% to a 100%.

If you're looking for a change, you might want to try getting your eyebrows threaded or waxed. The cleanup and shaping was a surprisingly big change, personally, and helped me out a lot in terms of dysphoria.
If it helps at all, I was looking at this picture trying to tell if you were MTF or FTM and I honestly can't tell. 

You come across as a teenage girl to me... But posting on trans. So either just beginning a FTM or after some time MTF.
[removed]
[removed]
made no progress?? if you call that making no progress im a girl
Cutie
You look really cute
Reshape your eyebrows into a more fem shape. Otherwise, I thought you were AFAB scrolling through. The eyebrows are, to me, are the tell. 

Then play with makeup and hairstyles and you'll absolutely pass, no question. Passing may give you the confidence to take the next step.

Good luck! This is your year!
Soooooo pretty 🤤 I wanna look like that!
Hey, you look pretty fem and great even without HRT. If you manage to get hormones, they are only going to make you look even more stunning.

I'm also a year in and I don't look even a  1/3 as good as you do. 😅
Happy new year beautiful.
You look perfect
Presuming you're transfem, um, you look great honestly? You're really pretty!
you can always get yourself set up with diy while you’re on a waitlist that way you can still get to legal stuff eventually but start making progress now:)
IDK I thought you were afab until I saw the sub ngl
U pass I would just say do your brows
you already pass imo. i’d definitely gender you as female if i saw you in passing
Says one of the prettiest girls I've seen...
Your hair is long and your face is more flushed. I think you made amazing progress.
Sweetie it will take time,just believe in yourself, and God will guide you every step of the way
Oh, you have... You're already very *naturally pretty*; I have Zero doubt you'll naturally grow into becoming effortlessly Beautiful!, and *breathtakingly* so!
If it makes you feel any better I started openly transitioning at 12. Im 27 now and yet to make any real progress with medical transition.
""An artists worst critic is themselves.""

You look bonny.
What progress do you need to make? You look gorgeous!
You look amazing absolutely amazing you stay strong and keep up the hard work and dedication
You look great 😊 as for getting on hrt …just do it. You’ll feel great once you do and never look back !!
You're doing great and your hair makes me jealous
I’ve been out for 2 and you look much further on than me.
trans flag!
Happy new year as well! I feel this. People here say the same as they said to me pre-hrt: about being pretty or not even recognizable as being transgender. And yes they are amazing words. But always I had the fear of letting the progress slip through my hands as I had no E yet. Fearing bigger scalps etc. Just for the reason of ending that fear, HRT has been amazing so far, and I wish you have it this year too!
Hey! Im ftm but anyways, don't beat yourself up for not making so much of a progress, it took me like 4 years to finally get a job so I could be on T. 
Keep fighting! You're gonna make it happen just not yet
I had to check the sub. If you’re mtf you absolutely pass, but if you’re ftm yeah I’m sorry for the lack of progress… really like the subtle eye make up! Also lovely long hair
You look like a beautiful women to me. I think you are seeing yourself much differently than everyone else! Dont worry girl u look so beautiful
what kind of progress are you looking to make?
assuming youre mtf? bc i would have absolutely no idea you were trans, you look like a woman
Why does everyone pass 100x better than me
Happy new year! I feel that, hugs!!!! 💖💖💖
Why?
I can relate
Hey, your picture is beautiful. To me you look like you were born female. I go for the natural look so to me, you already look perfect.

I'm going to offer some advice but I don't want to overstep. Please take what you like and leave the rest.

I would encourage you to do this transition now rather than waiting because testosterone is irreversible, so if you delay, the natural testosterone may change your looks, something that you may regret. There is no better time than now!

I don't know if this is too much for a public comment but just some wild guesses here, things I can imagine could be scary, may or may not be what's holding you up:
Are you afraid of the doctor's reaction? Are you afraid of your family's reaction? Are you afraid of the transition itself? Are there emotional aspects of the transition that are difficult? Do you feel that you deserve to be happy?

Maybe talking to a therapist can help clarify for you what the fears are about. But please don't put off your transition in order to see a therapist first, you can see the therapist while you are in transition.

You can do this. Wishing you all the best.
Very cute
You look like Chloë Grace Moretz- Like literally so stunning!!
You pass perfect
i honestly cant tell if youre ftm or mtf, tbh if this wasnt posted on a trans sub i wouldve just guessed youre cis
thanks
i’m not on hrt, that’s why i feel like i’ve made no 
progress. i’m too scared to see a. doctor
i basically looked the exact same a year ago
Yea... And they aren't even on HRT, which just stabs it in even worse lol
thanks
Me too
i’ve not seen any doctors yet about hrt and i barely ware anything other then a hoodie and jeans despite wanting to wear more feminine things. i feel like i’m just not doing anything
i’m not questioning my gender. i know i’m a woman. i just feel like i’ve not made much progress in terms of transitioning
i’m mtf
Ahh. Ok. Well, the good news is your facial structure is already very feminine. So if you do decide to go on hrt. I suspect you’ll be quite pleased with the results after a year or two. 

If you don’t mind the ask. What is it about asking the doctor about hrt that has you stymied? (Any answer is good. No judgments here)
Damn you got those cheeks and hair without HRT? Waouw, I'm kinda jealous tbh.
Not on hrt and look like Chloe Moretz' sister? I'm so jealous that's amazing!

What is it that you're scared of with the doctor?
It’s up to you! If what you’re wearing right now doesn’t make you feel feminine you can change up your style. Also I assumed you were AFAB at first! I also know you want to shape your eyebrows but I really like thick eyebrows, they’re pretty.
Well, I think everybody has their own process and what it looks like to go through that process. Because yourself, love yourself, and just choose to do what’s right I would not worry too much about the temperatures. What others of doing just do what makes you happy, do you
:o
i’m just really anxious and i just don’t know where to start with seeing one
Are you in the U.S.? If so, there are options in most states for informed consent care through groups like Planned Parenthood, some private medical practices, and possibly even your primary care provider. And if you live in decently sized city, your options potentially increase greatly. For example, my closest city of Washington DC trans care though the Whitman Walker clinics, most health insurers, as well as Planned Parenthood.
If you are in the UK, I believe your GP can prescribe HRT, in Canada it's the same, though they could refer you to an Endocrinologist, which is a specialist in hormone related things (mine also does diabetes I believe). Germany might be the same, but I'm not 100% sure. Friend of mine lives there and started estrogen like, 2 months ago. Really, your best bet, will be to either work up the courage to see a doctor about it and start the process, or go down a DIY route
i’m not in the US
Germany is quite different unfortunately
You could look into doing DIY HRT. I know a couple people in the UK that have to do that. Just make sure you’re being as safe as possible with it. r/TransDIY is a good resource.
Ok. Well, the best thing I can say would be to start googling what’s required to start hrt in your country. And, look for trans support groups in your country where you can ask those who’ve gone through it already to help answer your questions and point you in the right direction. 

Hoping you live in a relatively friendly place for trans care. And wishing you the best of luck in your journey. 💜"	100hraq	trans	2094	0.97	2023-01-01 11:27:25
13 months on E and I feel amazing. I have never been this happy with how I look.		"You look amazing, this is absolute goals right here
i always find it very interesting. A lot of times i have the feeling that when i look at pre transition pictures that the person is meant to be what they are transition too. Your case is awesome. it's like this lil tiny flower bloomed. You look gorgeous Girl! 😍✨
You look incredible!!
How old were you when you started, if you don’t mind me asking?
Powerful eyeliner. It's very nicely done. The hair is a neat style as well.  Very much so changed indeed. Congrats!
You’re so pretty! Your eyes are stunning
My lady that’s utterly impressive
you're  so beautiful!!!! also, i would've guessed years of E tbh
woah...just woah
Girl you look gorgeous and are absolutely glowing!!!! 😍 You are definitely goals for me 😅
How is it possible that you went on hormones 13 months ago when you have a post from a year ago that says you ""found out you were trans 3 days ago""? I know when reddit says ""1 year"" could be close to 2 years. But still, how did things go so incredibly fast? And it had to be during lockdown too.

Beautiful
Congrats sis!
Dam, you have every right to be happy with your looks, you look fabulous!
damn you look like a godess
Girl you hot 

Legit you look fantastic and I’m so happy for you, and these kinds of happy moments will just keep coming!!
quick question to all my fellow tranfemmes out there. does your hair swish, swoosh or swash?
If I had a dime for every time I saw someone and melted I’d be rich, you’re looking amazing
Wow you look so so stunning 💖
holy shit you look great! You're giving me hope for when I start to transistion.
May I say something as simple as  you are now ❣💕
Just WOW!! You look so beautiful. Congratulations on being happy and being an amazing woman.
Omg I'm so not jealous
These posts give me strength [pre HRT]
You look great!

Yesterday, i cried	" I had my FFS done last week. Yesterday my surgeon took of my bandages and i don't think i've ever cried so much before in my entire life.

Even though i still looked like I got run over by a truck, beneath the blood and the bruises for the first time in my life i saw myself in the mirror. No dysphoria, no judging myself, just pure Happiness. I never thought that I would get this far, and now that it finally happened i can't even begin to describe this feeling. 

Just wanted to share, and i wish everyone the best of luck with their transition. We can all get through this, life can be so great <3"	"[deleted]
whats ffs?
This is wholesome and inspiring. I'm so looking forward to my FFS for all these reasons. I know I am there beneath the mask ♡
I can't wait to get mine! I've only just begun this whole journey, but everything I see on this subreddict makes me excited for the end of it!
I'm so happy for you, that sounds amazing and I hope we all get to have days like this <3
I’m so happy for you. I can’t wait to start hormones and get top surgery too.
I wish you a speedy recovery!
So vicariously happy for you
I'm so glad I don't need major surgeries like this, because I'm afraid of surgery. I'm so lucky that I look just like my mom
That’s awesome! Congrats :)
I kinda wanna see your beauty now🥺👉👈
That’s so wonderful to hear! I can’t wait to get ffs some day. Right now I think it’s financially out of reach unfortunately.
Congrats!!!
mazel tov!! that is so wonderful!
If you google what FFS stands for it says “For Fuck’s sake”
Im so happy for you! 

My hair is starting to get long and although I have masculine hairline and I’m very afraid of loosing it I had a very feminine hairstyle and when I tried new feminine/androgynous clothes I no get I got tears too.. I was just crying l - out of happiness.. Irish you the absolute best, I bet you look incredible!
I just got FFS a month ago! Same feeling! I didn't cry myself, but emotionally I've been so high, everything looks so different, my face looks so much brighter and happier, I love it! I love it so so so much. I feel so much more put together
That’s amazing I’m so happy for you!
I am MtF but have look quite feminine as I am, would I still be able to get this surgery?
If you don’t mind, how much did it cost? Mind sharing the doctors name?
How long into HRT were you before you got your ffs surgery?
What's fss?
Lots of love to you 💞
In fact, now I’m crying.
Congratulations welcome to the first day of the rest of your life
I’m so happy for you!!!! I thought this would be a different story because I almost cried the other day when I looked in the mirror. Im pre hrt and have been transitioning on other areas and  I usually avoid mirrors and when I looked I felt horror so I’m soo proud of you
😎
I want to transition to a girl but nervous my family will not approve. I’m turning 21..I don’t want to wait any longer but I also don’t want to lose my family over it
I had mine three weeks ago Monday, and all the bruising is gone. I think all the swelling and the horrible pain for the first week was preventing me from appreciating what I’ve gained, but I looked at myself in the mirror today and smiled at my reflection for the first time in my life.  No tears of joy... just intense satisfaction for the results of all of the money, time, and pain.

Oh, one other tip I didn’t see - to get the bacitracin out of your hair wash it with conditioner. Only needs two rinses to get it all. Further, you are going to have a dismaying amount of hair loss... I struggle to cover the incision... so start using Nutrafol and minoxidil as soon as feasible. Also the horrible headaches mostly went away when the sutures and staples are removed.  Also get a good sunblock and wear it religiously.

Good luck girl... your life is really about to begin!
When you feel comfortable, (and if  you're comfortable sharing pre transition pics, totally valid if you aren't) I'd love to see the results!
That's amazing for you!!! I hope you have a speedy recovery and we get to see your smiling face soon!!
i could not be happier for u!
I have my consultation in August I'm so excited :) I've been waiting so long and it's finally in motion!!!
So absolutely feeling for you right now.  Love to hug you and give all the comfort and love you deserve.  Like a miraculous cure for testosterone poisoning.  I am so looking forward to my FFS because of testimony like yours.

Lots and lots of love to you 💕💕💕💕💕💕
Remember not to take grapefruit with antidepressants though. A lot of us are on them and you would be suprised how often they forget to tell you stuff and instead leave it in a dense jargon filled document
Thanks so much for the tips! So far I am healing very well, even the doc is surprised. Like you said only major swelling left is my nose and i still have some bruises under the eyes and on my cheeks but no pain at all, i've gone off the pain meds today and I am still feeling very good ! :))
Also- for swollen nose, running it under cold water / applying ice will allow you to breath. Witch hazel will reduce the bruising faster.
Facial feminization surgery, its multiple procedures in one 😊
For Fucks Sake.

Jk it's Facial Feminization Surgery
Thanks so much! I hope you can sit still, waiting for these things can be so tedious but it's definitly worth the wait :)) Good luck to you
Im glad to hear that! Surgery really should be a last resort, transitioning is challenging enough already 😄
haha, i was thinking about making a post in trans timelines but i still have some popped bloodvessels in my eyes making me look like a ghoul :D if youre still curious just dm me
Thank you! I really feel that, without the help of my family i couldve never afforded it at this point in my life. Being comfortable in your own body shouldn't have a price in the first place but i guess here were are. I sincerely wish that you can get it some day, you deserve it!
Very relatable, growing out my hair was the first thing i did and the euphoria that gave me fueled me for a long time! Thank you so much and best of luck to you aswell :)
Ohh thats so great, thats exactly how im feeling! Its just so motivating, makes you wanna go out into the world :))
Sure! You can always get it since it is a cosmetic surgery, but that means insurance often won't cover it
if thats something you want, absolutely. consultations between doctors will give you a sense of what you may need, but its all up to you :)
Sure can do since he did a really great job and would want some advertising! My operation was with Dr. Funk in Munich, Germany. The cost was around 28.000€ for a 7 hour opeartion including procedures on my chin, jaw, nose, brow, cheeks, forehead and scalp.
1 1/2 years on hormones at the point of the surgery 😊
Facial feminization surgery :)
I hope i didnt make you sad! :(
Beautiful way to put it! Thank you ❤️
Yeah, I also can't count how many times i've cried before when i looked in the mirror, but this was the first time it was from happines and not sadness or disgust. The pre hrt times are the toughest ones, but if you are making progress already thats great! I hope one day I'll see your post when you can look in the mirror without fear, you can do it! :)
That's completly understandable. I was insanly lucky to have a family that not only accepts me but supports me every step of the way. I wish you the best of luck and that you find a way to become yourself while keeping your relationship with your family intact!
Woah thanks for this lol I never knew that! But now I want grapefruits
Not only antidepressants is worth further pointing out. I would consult about each medication, and if you have been eating grapefruit regularly, keep in mind that you may need a dose adjustment if you stop. I am not a doctor.
[deleted]
ahh
i want this now
I can’t wait to get for fuck’s sake one day
I can barely wait. I have been for about a month now and hope i’ll get the appointment soon ;-;
But thank you so so much!
I'd really like to see. I'm looking into surgeons now myself
Thank you! 😊
Thank you so much!
Okay. Does this apply to the UK or are we taking about another countries health care?
Thank you! I’m very happy for you! Congratulations 🎉
When you were doing your consultation did they say anything about how long you should be on hrt before getting ffs?

When did you stop seeing changes in your face from hrt?

I'm only 3 months in and definitely feeling inpatient. Thanks for the replies - I'm hoping I feel the same way when it's my turn.
Nonono it’s okay I’m so so happy for you!!!<3
Thanks babe!!! Keep me posted I’ll send you a dm
Thank you sweetie! Hopefully with time they’ll be more accepting of this and I can finally come out and live my life as the girl I’ve known I am since very early on.
If you don’t mind me asking...How did you come out to your family?
And don’t eat grapefruit if you take Lipitor
You are way too kind <3 <3 I am already feeling so great, I cannot wait for it to heal fully! It scares me that this went over so easy, i thought it would toughen me up for SRS but this was so uneventful i dont think it really prepared me 😄 and great now i know how the stuff is called that was in my hair, also took me ages to get out, i cant really feel my head rn so that made it even more difficult

I am really overwhelmed by all this positive resonance, ive never shared anything about my transition before, and now all this positive reinforcement really makes me tear up. Thank you for your support, hopefully I can do the same when someone else here needs it 💖
It removes what male puberty did to the facial bones
Me too. For fucks sake I m looking forward to for fucks sake
All over the world! It costs more or less, depending on country, but most consultations are free unless you work with the best of the best in business. You will need to do a lot of research (there's a lot of doctors who botch surgeries, so be wary!). Most cost on average of 20,000-40,000 dollars for the surgery and recovery time.

&#x200B;

My wife and I are in the USA and hers is 30,000 with Regina Rodman out of Texas. :) Her consultations are free.
We talked about my hormone treatment yes, I dont think the changes in my face have stopped yet but its quite minimal, cheeks still getting more puffy and so on.

The surgeon will take into account where you stand in your transition since he is going of the structure of the bones in the face anyways. The surgery is then constructed in a way where further changes from hrt will only enhance it :) 

Best of luck to you, its a huge decision and I hope it will make you just as happy as me or even more :)
No problem, but it's a really boring story 😄 My sister is also trans, and she outed herself way before me. So when it was my turn to out me i just basically said to my mom when we were waiting in the car: ""mum, uhm it's me aswell."" She had to think about it for a second then she almost fainted but then we laughed and thats it!
I do take SNRI/Stabilizer/Stabilizer daily, propranolol and hydroxyzine as needed. I wonder if it’s bad for propranolol.
Ironically I felt like FFS was harder than SRS after getting both. The bone healing has been a lot more rough for me than the flesh lol
Thanks for sharing! That’s awesome that you have an older sister to help you with this. One of my lady friends from school kinda knows. I haven’t told her specifically but I get the feeling she knows. I will probably open up to her about it first. 
Would be easier if people in general were more understanding. I think transgender individuals are still looked at negatively by many.

I'm getting kicked out of my new home by my roommates in less than 30 days	"I've been living with two girls since I started my transition and while it was originally pretty nice one of my roommates was extremely religious and the more she researched transgender stuff and by researched I mean watch preachers talk about it the more hostile she got towards me tell me I was damaging my soul going to hell and stuff and now she is convinced I am just a monster and a danger to the point where I came home and they were yelling saying I had 30 days to get out and out of their lives and I have nowhere to go I don't have enough income to get an apartment I don't have the credit to get approved I don't know what to do I'm going to be homeless after finally being free of my own family and thinking I finally got into a safe place I really don't know what to do I'm so scared I'm going to lose absolutely everything after making the progress I've needed I went from 334 LB extremely depressed unhappy male had tried to kill myself multiple times to a happy woman just finally free and almost lost 90 lb so far and I'm going to lose everything I don't know to do

I'm going to go ahead and add that the house is legally my roommates she's the one who bought the house and offered to let me stay so there's nothing really protecting me she can kick me out I'm not legally a tenant I think she was purposely keeping it under the rug and while she looked into everything I don't know"	"+1 to the list of times religion fucks over other people who aren't even related to it
Depending on where you live and local squatters rights, if you've been there a bit she may not be able to kick you so easily. Search for local housing laws and see what your options are.
Hang in there. Can you post the country and state you're in, so people can suggest LGBTQ+ organizations etc. that might have more regional connections to help? If you're willing to, approximate location (e.g. nearby bigger city) might also help if someone happens to be willing to provide a couch to crash - don't count on that happening here on reddit, but you never know.
She has to give you 60 days, and she cannot discriminate against you. 

[Georgia Landlord Tenant Handbook](https://www.dca.ga.gov/sites/default/files/2-15-21_handbook_final_draft.docx)
Absolutely keep looking for a new place to live, but if you've been living there long enough to establish residence, they can't kick you out. If you hit thirty days and you don't have a place lined up, just don't leave. Your bigoted roommates may try to make your life as difficult as possible, but tenants rights mean they can't just shove you out the door if you've been living there for an extended period of time. Make them remove you by force before you willingly leave and become homeless. This is an absolutely fucked situation, but you have the option to just *not leave.* If you go this route, I would highly recommend getting a padlock for your bedroom door that you can use whenever you're not there. 

Do not roll over and let them make you homeless. If they try to legally evict you, you will still have more than 30 days. Good luck.
I shared this under a different comment but I’m posting it again to ensure you get a chance to see it. Georgia law protects individuals who are not on the lease who have paid rent in some form

If you have no lease agreement, and just pay your rent every month, you are considered a “tenant-at-will.” Under Georgia law, the landlord is required to give you a notice of at least 60 days before requiring you to move out. After that, you can be evicted.

Even if you are not on the lease you have rights that you can use to help you. Also The Georgia Fair Housing Act was passed to ensure all Georgians can compete for housing within their economic means on a fair and equitable basis.  It prohibits discrimination in housing and housing-related activities because of disability, race, sex, color, national origin, religion, or familial status. So do with this as you will but it sounds like you have strong case for discrimination
I would recommend saving any income you get towards apt costs. I just got a an apt of my own for $950 a mo with the same for a deposit. Obviously your mmv with location and other expenses, but if I could do it, you can, and I'm one smooth brained bi-pedal creature.
I’m not sure how far barrow ga is from Atlanta but I know lgbt centers and groups in Atlanta have a lot resources and could possibly help you out in this situation. I would post in a lgbt Facebook group in the biggest city closest to you with an lgbt center and tell them everything they most likely will know a lot more about the laws in Georgia and what you could do
You can always go to an Oxford house in the mean time if you do get kicked out or don’t have longer than 30 days. All you have to do is not use any drugs or alcohol, the rent is paid weekly and can be as low as $80/ week. 

Almost no one ever knows about this because they’re not addicts, but it has saved me on two occasions. You can interview and move in sometimes as soon as the day you apply. Both of the houses I lived in were nice houses that probably cost in the $400k range. They were clean and full of very nice people trying to get their lives together. Recovering addicts can be some of the most helpful, genuine, and selfless people you’ll ever meet. 

Obviously the catch is that in the flip side some houses can be dirty and full of very sketchy people, it all depends on the area.
Briefly read sone of this. You said you have been paying rent in cash, if you have pull all your bank statements showing you pulled xyz dollars out always at roughly the same time. Also if you were living there I am going to assume you are getting mail there. This is 100% the easiest way to prove you are in fact a tenant even though not on the lease. Assert your rights under the law of your state and make them go through the whole process in order to buy yourself some time to find a new place. It’s rough living with people that may make things hostile but it’s not as rough as being homeless.
You can't legally be evicted just because they told you to go please visit r/legaladvice on how to approach this.
Listen to everyone about your rights! What they are doing is illegal and if they want to evict you, they need to do it the legal way instead of harassing you. As of right now, I'm pretty sure they are also violating some Fair Housing stuff just from the harassment based on gender identity. An eviction notice is scary but also gives you some more immediate attention and access to people or services that can help you, like a local housing association or LGBT center. Start reaching out now. Research your local tenant/landlord rights. Use that knowledge of your rights to push back at them and bide your time until you can figure out how to get to your next place. Hopefully a safer one with plenty of other queer people around to support you.
I see a lot of people saying that you might legally be required to be given more time, but I believe pushing for that extra time will just expose you to more cruelty and abuse.  I don’t know how to go about finding another place to live, believe me I wish I did because I would be moving out myself (though for me it’s not that urgent), but I do recommend trying to get out as quickly as possible.
God or whomever: just be good people and don't hurt others.

Human: oh you mean just the ones like me right? Cuz I don't like x group

God or whomever: how the hell did you get that from what I said?

Human: well anyway I wrote a book said you wrote it and now the whole world is writing other books and we all hate each other for no reason.


This is religion at best... At worst it turns people against other for no reason....

Is there any trans friendly organization around your area that could help?
Do you have any text messages showing why they kicked you out? If you can get documentation you could have an open and shut case of discrimination in court. That may also buy you time
There has to be something that can be done. Stay calm. It's going to be okay.
Contact a tenant lawyer asap.

Edit: also gather evidence
Might be worth a read to see if it applies to you.

This makes my blood boil. I’m so sorry. My DMs are open if you’d like to talk.
These stories just break my fucking heart 😔
Very Christ-like of her. So glad she decided she would rather follow the preacher's that tell her who and how to hate rather than the ones who emphasize the understanding Jesus preached. /s

Makes me mad when people devote so much energy to being douchenozzles to others when they could just be chill
Is it my brain playing tricks on me or did I read this exact same story 8-10 months ago?
First definitely look into your tenet rights, if you have a landlord I believe they are the only ones who can evict you not your roommate. And on top of that you can’t evict someone for being trans, that’s gender discrimination and is the same as trying to evict someone for being Mexican or for being Muslim, it’s discreet and it’s illegal. You should still definitely find a new place bc this is a very unsafe situation so I recommend looking for rooms for rent. They are a lot cheaper and easier to find, you can look on Craigslist or on Roomies.com and you can find places as low as $400 a month sometime. I hope your able to figure things out and that your able to stay safe!
Are either of these girls the landlord? Because roommates can yell at you all they want but if they're not the landlord they can't legally kick you out. Also look into your state and see if it's even legal to kick you out for being trans.
They have to formally evict you. They can't just kick you out
What area are you in? If your comfortable sharing, are there any housing options with a shelter? Maybe an lgbt friendly resource (like a group/bar) that you could go to and find other queer people who may be able to help, even if your couch crashing for the time being it's better than being on the street. Do you have a cashapp? I'm sure if you put it on here and even just a handful of people send you 10-20 $ it adds up for sure, hell I'll start with sending you $30 myself.
I’m sorry this happened
Check the state and locals laws on what constitutes a tenant. In many states simply paying rent for over 30 days qualifies as an tenant and many many states make it illegal to evict a tenant based on gender or sexual orientation.
From what I'm reading, a lot of helpful resources were posted. Hope they're of use to you, my DMs are open if you'd like to talk it out. 
Situations like this can be overwhelming, even when aid is given.
Wishing the best!

Hope this helps, but many just deny the science
Are you on the lease at all? It is unlawful to evict someone on account of gender identity/expression so it’s not legally something they can do if you’re on the lease. 

In the meantime, since it’s not going to be a good living situation anyways, look into local lgbtq resources like a Facebook lgbt group for your community. State that you need trans-friendly housing at $xx-xx price range.
Religion strikes again....
Look for people who are renting out a room. They will usually include most or all utilities and it's MUCH cheaper than renting an entire apartment by yourself
im religious and yet even i know this is stupid.

god i hate my religion
Someone did something similar to me and gosh did it suck. Evil person tbh… if not really I stable. That being said I would look for a roommate in another place, there are probably places you can look up lgbt safe homes and find a roommate. Not every place looking for roommates will need as much and it’ll be easier probably. 

You’re roommate sucks big time btw.
İ don't understand those religious people who claim ""you are damaging your soul or you're going to hell"", if hell and their god exist I'm the only one who will go to hell, not you so stop trying to intervene my life, it's MY/OUR life. I'm so sorry for what you've been through i know it's hard and you feel scared that's normal Honey, idk where you live but try to communicate with LGBT groups there, I'm sure everything will be fine.
I’m in a somewhat similar situation where my girlfriend and her family had taken me in after a few bad fights with my parents but now after 2 years of living with eachother she’s kicking me out and I don’t have the money rn for an apartment either so am have too head back too my parents although me moving out has made it easier with us moving back In can raise for some problems so I know kinda what you are going thru and I hope you can make it out alright and you can get where you need too be
Ummm. Your safe.. regardless if your a tenant. There was an agreement that was witnessed that you could stay there. With that in mind. She cannot remove you without (generally 60 day notice) and can't force you out. I had siniliwr issues with family friends and they were breaking shit and emotionally abusive as fuck and loud. We called the cops after being threatened but since nothing had actually happened and we were actually in fear. They could do nothing. Didnt even remove them for the night or anything. We only agreed to let them stay for a short time while getting a job
Look into community housing! I am so sorry this is happening.
I wish I could help!
I wish, so much, that we had [Rainbow Ridge ](https://www.reddit.com/r/RainbowRidgeCO?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) already set up. I would give u a place to stay in a heartbeat. Unfortunately we are about $50k short of making that a reality at the moment. 

No, I am NOT asking for anyone to help financially because I know that we are better off than many ppl. 

What I am asking is for ideas and suggestions from the trans community on how to make it better. 

We are even building a trans inclusive, trans positive religion to give those who feel the need to have a religion and a god/goddess to honor. I am writing our holy book now to do just that. (Up to the story of Noah now). 

As a mom, I can't imagine turning my back on my kids, especially when they are going through something so emotional and potentially traumatic, as transitioning into their true selves. This is when kids need their parents most, not having to listen to their religious BS.
She is not a religious person. Religious person seek to go to heaven not to submit their asses to Hell. She spread hate violence and evil. She is not religious. 
She lick thé balles of satan while pretending a parlé necklace make her Christian. She won't fool St Peter, she'll go straight to Hell.
Why would you need to go
I think most people have  great ideas here. I would like to add another route option as well to try and extend your grace period. 
I realize how it sounds to say”have you tried talking about it?” Because they are clearly insane idiots.. but rather than just talk, 
you can try manipulating them. I know it seems like bad but it’s actually pretty common. 

let’s say you analyze your roommate who owns the house. 
Take a look at what she wants, what pleases her, and what doesn’t. 

She likes Christianity and doesn’t like transgender people.

Often if there’s a nasty manager I gotta deal with i see what they want, like this guy loves to talk and has a big ego. So my strategy is to let him run his mouth, pretend I’m interested and agree, and win him over. 
To be clear I’m not saying let her run her mouth and just keep Yelling bullshit because that isn’t working. 

But if there’s even a possibility to try to have any kind of conversation with her, I’d use that
Are there any studio apartments around you? I live in Houston, Texas so I can’t really recommend you places to stay, but I recommend asking to stay with another friend until you get everything together. You could try to offer being  roommates or find offers to be roommates from random people online as well. A shelter is your last resort, but that’s okay. Or, you could try to convince your roommates to keep you until you save up enough money to get your own apartment? Idk, but I wish you the best of luck
As someone who has practiced law, the legal points y’all are making are largely correct. Sometimes, however, real life has a way of transcending statutes.

The fact is, OP is a trans woman living with cis het women, one of whom is a religious maniac. “Christians” like her have no compunction against lying. 

If OP puts up a fuss, I give 5-to-1 odds that the Christian cis het woman cries rape (or any other crime, but given the current climate, probably something sexual) before either 30 or 60 days are up. In that case, OP is even worse off than she now is. 

Girl, stand not upon the order of your going but go at once, whatever that requires.
I’m so sorry girl, that’s awful and unfair, but you’ve got time, and I’m sure you’ll be able to find somewhere else you could live with roommates who aren’t awful, best of luck queen
Tell her to worry bout her own hypocritic soul, Jesus don't approve of bullying and spreading hate. 

Don't know what to suggest since I am from different country
All u have to do is have proof that u live there like a bill in your name that has came to that address like credit card bill or anything phone bill etc and they will have to go file for eviction and even if u don't have those things if they call the police they will tell them the same thing that they will have to file for eviction because I can't make someone leave without going through the proper procedure.
Yeah, I have no use for the imaginary friend, and even less use for the followers of the imaginary friend.  Not sure what state you live in, or if you are even in the us.  Many states have laws that prevent this sort of thing from happening.
You can find a new place to live, maybe you could do a whats app group of pepole in your city that is in a similar situation (or post here, maybe there is more trans pepole in this comunity that lives in your city), and thogheter you could get a new place to live, i suggest to find a new place because i doubt that its going to be good for you to live with the stress of your roommates. Good luck, you will find a new place thats for sure
maybe looking for people that would be interesed in living together could be nice. idk any resources tto help with that butt im pretty sure there should be some communities on reddit or other platforms where people try to get in contact with other strangers to live together etc.
if you were living there and receiving mail there you can fight them to buy time. it will cause more issues but it can but you the time you need to properly get out of there.  sorry you're going through this, religious bigots strike again 😔
I'm so sorry this is happening to you.

I know how it feels to be somewhere you believe to be a safe space, with safe people and things like this happen.

I would suggest that you do your due diligence and research what the law says, in your particular state, in regard to renters rights.  You may already have!  If you have, good on you!!

What I do know for a fact is, that if the owner invited you to stay, and you have moved your things in, you can't be flippantly removed.

I also know there is a tendency for State by State law to lean more in favor of protecting the tenant.
Did you sign a lease?
Check Craigslist or local newspaper for room for rent..go anywhere from 250 -800 a month. You can be safe again
What happened to ""Judge not lest ye be judged"" and ""love thy neighbor as thyself""? She isn't doing this because of her religion, she is doing this because is a hateful bigot and using her religion so she can be in denial about being a monster. 

You don't happen to live in WA do you?
It doesn’t matter if you’re paying rent or not, in most places once you’ve lived somewhere for long enough you have rights and cannot just be evicted
I'm so sorry to hear that. I wish I could just take in every one if us that ended up homeless for being authentic. I don't know what to do. Sometimes trans support organizations have resources to help with this or are able to help you access other supports. Have you been able to find a trans support organization in your area?
Try looking for a new place with roommates
I would be very cautious with yourself saying your not a tenant. 

A few things: have you paid rent? Do you have conversations on your phone regarding the circumstances of your moving in? You actually may find yourself more of a tenant than you think, additionally places tend to (but conservatives are working against this everywhere so check if you still have it or were ever allowed to have it:) protect living arrangements. Meaning if you were offered a place to stay, barring any violent threats from you the tenant, you have protections to that place. The tenant-landlord relationship can get very ambiguous real quick which is why it's very important to be aware of how you are offering room and board to friends and people in need. 

Now having said all of that, I am pretty sure you don't want to stay in that place long term, but the reality is that given the exact laws in place this acquaintance cannot offer you a place and then rescind said offer over protected grounds causing you to be left without reasonable living arrangements. Meaning that if she wants to get rid of you she needs to be following the requirements for landlords: serving the proper notice legally speaking which would then provide a ""reasonable"" amount of time for you to find a new place.
I wonder why we aren’t getting the support we deserve. I mean we do by people we trust but, they eventually cut the rope and shoehorn religion. I just don’t get why…
Legally if you get mail delivered you live there as well ... Your name may not be on the lease but you are considered a tenant ... I would look into the laws of your state and see what else you can do maybe reach out to the local LGBT community if you have one ... It's better to try and find a roommate who is trans as well or who is an ally.
Hope everything works out for you. ❤️🤞
In most places if you live there you are a tenant. Did she give you legal notice to move out? There is a process so check the law where you live, it might buy you some more time.
Try to make go fund me
Im sure a lot of folks would be willing to help you out if you explain the situation
If you are home and they aren’t one day change all the locks, then they legally can’t do anything because of Squatters rights
Religion is a constant blight on society that poisons people's minds and makes otherwise rational kind people do irrational and hateful things.

It needs to be actively dismantled.
Idk what town ur in, if ur in a larger city, check out the lgbt center, most have housing programs or r connected to shelters for this very reason. Some of the programs are age based so for those 16-24, idk if ur in that age group but if u are the center should have more resources for u.   I would also check out online websites like roommates.com and cirtru for quick housing w little to no deposit or credit check so u can just move in. Good luck and be safe, I truly hope this helps w this scenario as much as possible
And for no reason
Personally I'm Norse pagan and it helped me to accept myself as trans and also opened my eyes towards being better person, by showing me some of my bad traits. Honestly, its not about religion all the time in my opinion by more about people. I left Christianity when I was young because I knew how stupid it was and it made my relationship with family harder but I don't regret becoming atheist for those few years as I could learn more about nihilism and so on. It opened my eyes also in different way and from there moving to spiritualism in general, Buddhism and more of meditation techniques or Tai chi and different traditional traits toward many cultures.

 I think it's more important to explore each culture and learn toward being better rather than hate on them because of some people behavior. It's true, some people, fanatics, are a hard deal but it doesn't change the fact that many people find their own peace of mind and a chance to be better by that same religion we talk about.

Dont get me wrong, I don't like Christianity and some other religions, from historical, ethical and just plain logic I think Christianity is truly a bad religion. But that's more of my emotional hardship with them, Christians, as child. My parents, grandparents and generally all community in my village were all Christians and most of them bad and usually spend a lot of time bullying me so I personally have deep hate towards Christianity.

But yeah, op in this post met those who would one call... Bad people. I hope it gets better for op and well, that's kinda it. GOOD LUCK!
Yep glad I'm atheist I'm also getting a sign for the door next month that will charge people 50$ a minute to sell me something or talk about religion
We've all only been in this house for like 4-8? months
Yeah, I want to second this. In my state letting someone stay even as briefly as a weekend  can create a defacto landlord / tenant relationship.  Especially if there is no documentation saying otherwise. Source: am landlord. 

If you do any chores, cleaning up, pet sitting, etc around the house then that's an even stronger relationship.  It can show you're paying rent through work. 

[fair housing act info](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/fair_housing_act_overview)

This might be of some help. It sounds like she has an owner-occupied property with two current tenants. I assume you all have your own rooms? If there are 5 total bedrooms I'm the house, the the act would apply. It may apply anyway, assume it does.

Your state and local laws may have more protections.

If so, in addition to illegal eviction, she could face charges of sexual harassment.  

I'm not saying you should stay there. But she should follow the laws and that will take some time, maybe enough to get things sorted out for you. 

This is exactly why we have laws like this. But you have to proactively assert any right you have under most laws, and do that quickly. So don't 2nd guess yourself. Be clear, and remember it's up to her to prove the fair housing act does not apply. 

Most of all, be calm, write down everything you do around there, and especially if there are things she has asked you to do via text, keep those as proof. If you help pay for anything, also grab any receipts or bank statements showing that. 

Most of all, be calm, explain to her that you are exercising your rights as a tenant and under the fair housing act, and that if she doesn't stop sexually harassing you then you may bring action against her. 

Always and often, in writing, let her know you're willing to sit down, absent any harassment at all, and work to find a compromise that can work for everyone. If this ever gets to a judge, that will help,  but also, you should mean it. 


Best of luck love! I hope they come to their senses sooner than later!
In Barrow county in Georgia

And I've asked every single friend I know every coworker I could my family cut ties with me nobody I know is going to let me stay with them I've been begging even to let me sleep on the floor
You may be considered a tenant at will. If that’s the case, you have rights. [Georgia Legal Aid](https://www.georgialegalaid.org/resource/tenants-rights-brochure)
This
They’re not legally a tenant. This does not apply.
I'm not on the lease this is legally my roommates house she was buying the house and didn't have enough of a down payment new I was looking to get away from my family initially tried to help me or use me I use my tax return to help her get the house but I'm not legally a tenant she did everything under the rug just ask me to send the money to her and I've been living with her since March I believe and I asked her to draw up an agreement but she never did
I make $900 bi weekly apartments some of the cheapest I've found in my area start at $1,400 and I don't even have credit to get approved and my current job I got literally a month ago I don't even think I have enough job history for a lot of these apartments I couldn't afford

I've looked into extended stay hotels which would cost me over $3,000 a month not making them a possible option I am watching Facebook marketplace and replying to roommate posts but it's scary
I'm an hour from Atlanta
I'm straight edge not alcohol drugs smoking anything
Oh and it was a bit of a gamble for me, but I found a sublet that was affordable. Was in a student house, not the most hygienic, and I was pretty crammed with all my stuff in a small bedroom or in a garage... not a great situation but it was safe and I could finally breathe. It's really tough being in a hostile home. I used to live with a coastguard guy that would curse me out for random reasons every day... but I was ""lucky"" to have that room. I was... well it was kind of better than being homeless/living out of my car... but the abuse was bashing me back to not being able to work. So depressed, but it lifted a ton by finding a way out. And a little positive pressure+a few months to get on my feet again and save up was enough to find a new place.
She was staying there without contract, just giving money for the rent it, idk if she can do anything with a lawyer
Didn't Jesus said to love your neighbor, and to love others like you love yourself or am I confused? 🤔
It feels familiar to me too, now that you mention it
I live in Barrow county in Georgia I'm about an hour outside of Atlanta I'm not sure how ok it is to post but my cash app is $RebeccaMarie278
They’ve expanded that research, but I can’t find an abstract on it yet. Must not have been published yet.
I Identify as a Christian woman myself it's been pretty hard to actually I've lost my faith over and over more time than I can count in fact it's kind of weird recently I've been far more happy and far more faithful but stuff always seem to hit the fan when I am

I'm looking for other roommates at the moment honestly if anyone in Georgia is interested message me I desperately hope I can get out of this situation in the better off
Satanists are pro trans and pro freedom though, so if theres a hell run by Satan , her religious roommates wont be welcome there.
I do have time I'm hoping I can get out of this situation I really desperately wish I can find a fellow trans girl or a guy that would like to combined our money together and get a place because I am just getting so sick of this cisgendered agenda they always talk about how we are the ones with an agenda but who's the ones attacking who who's the ones trying to make whose life terrible and if we're talking about religion who's the actual one's going down there trying to convert people and just so sick of all this
No they kept everything under the table I think on purpose now that this is happening
I've been watching Facebook marketplace as there's rooms posted on there and I can start watching Craigslist I forgot about that one
I live in Georgia I swear it was whatever those preachers she was listening to I actually heard her listening in a one time and we actually had a bit of a fight because I was just trying to explain everything he was saying because he was saying like intersex didn't exist that trans people killing themselves like seriously the guy was talking about the suicide rate was a sign that being transgendered was something that needed to be corrected that the actual suicide were the cause of us trying to be transgender or something I wish I could find that damn video but it was the most bullshit stuff I've ever heard
All she did was when she was yelling at me told me I have 30 days to get out no official anything
I'm highly considering this but I've actually tried it before for my transition and got no notice
I agree.  I love atheism.  So nice to be free of the mind shackles of religion.  Break free and be free.
I wouldn’t say dismantled, I'd prefer strongly contained. As much as religious organisation are a threat to freedom and a poison to society in general, dismantling religions would typically require in turn authoritarian policies I couldn’t support. Also, you can’t change culture on command. People act and make sense of their beliefs in various ways and this has to be acknowledged too. But I think religious organisations should all be put under control, they shouldn’t be allowed to push any political agenda of their own. And proselytism should be strictly forbidden.
Bigots would just use something else to inflict their views upon others. Religion is just a handy excuse.

I absolutely understand how much it has screwed people, but the problem isn't religion\*, it's people. Dismantling religion would just lead to another thing that people flocked to so they could expouse their bigoted opinions.

\*Cults like the JW can go to hell, there's nothing good about them.
I don't think it needs to be dismantled, but it certainly needs to be reorganized and taught properly.
oddly enough I grew closer to my faith after starting my transition…? am I wrong for that previously I had no interest but can’t help but be interested now
Just want to point out this is the exact outlook religious people have on the LGBTQ+ community.
Nah we're just in a transitory state of figuring out our path as a species post industrialization. The old ways are dying and this phase of uncertainty breeds dogmatic zealots. Not excusing their behavior but it comes from a place of deep existential fear. You see people do similar things with political parties and economic systems. The world today is just in a real pickle. You're right Religion can lead people to do terrible things in the name of God, history isn't short examples, but people can be brought together by faith to do real good in the world too. The actual message of Jesus was unconditional love for all people, that's it, and I think that's a valuable message we can all get behind.
 (I'm not exclusively promoting Christianity or disavowing it. Every one of the old religions has positive and negative thoughts and practices Christianity is just probably the most relevant to readers)
Religion isn't bad: it's people who use religion as a scapegoat reason to be bad that are bad. Religion can be great for some, and help to give comfort for some. Just shitty people use religion as their ""Righteous Reason"" so they can either control others or hurt people. 

Mind you, I am saying this as a Hellenistic Witch who follows Dionysus as my primary Diety. Probably the farthest thing from what most religious people believe.
I have to respectfully disagree. There are a few religions that are not hateful towards others and are respectful of others' beliefs. I am a Pastafarian and part of the second ""I'd Really Rather You Didn't"" says, ""I’d really rather you didn’t use my existence as a means to oppress, subjugate, punish, eviscerate, and/or, you know, be mean to others."" 

I never understood why what someone else believes has to effect me. Go pray to your god(s), live how you think they think you should, and leave me alone.
I only caution this. Religion does not have to be this way and I and many like me are trying to change that narrative internally and make more tolerant religious people. Though I do understand your frustration.

Anywho peace!
I agree and disagree to a point, i would like religion being dismantled (im not going to talk about why, vecause this is not my point in this comment). But we need religion, why? Well because religion fills our needs in socety to work, what are those needs? Give pepole same belifes and a moral compass. If we want to dismantled religion we need something that can fill the same place. But i will point out that this is not a religon problem, because not every religion is hatefull
I mean from what I've experienced Hellenism is full of amazing people and everyone is actively encouraged to come up with their own conclusions. 

There's also a lot of trans and overall lgbtq representation.
I agree, it ruins so many lives by just existing, the benefit it gives is minimal to the huge amount of evil it causes, religion has been the cause of war, genocides and the extinction of so many cultures 

Honestly becoming an athiest has helped me a lot, but my family doesnt know that so I need to still participate in jewish tradition
Religion itself, I'd beg to differ. Now, narrow it down to primarily Christianity in modern times? I whole heartedly agree. Religion isn't in itself harmful. In fact, religion can and has done a lot of good, the issue is people not letting their religion evolve with time. Christianity as one of the most prominent examples is still largely the same as it always has been and never evolves with time and our new discoveries, because everyone involved wants it to stay exactly the same.
Disagree, religion isn't an issue, the people who practice it are.

Some people can't comprehend or don't want to accept the idea of everything being meaningless, and as such turn to religion as a way to feel they have meaning, which there's nothing wrong with.

Many people will use their religion as a means to do good, just the same as many will use it as an excuse to do bad. But it needs to be noted that religion itself is not the issue, how people express their religion is a reflection of themselves and not of faith in general.

Even if there were no religion, kind people would find ways to be kind, and sh*t bags would find other excuses to be sh*t bags.

Sincerely,
 - a fruity atheist
The problem with religion, especially in the US, is that there are basically all the fanatics and nutcases of any given religion, since there these people had the room to get a foothold in sosciety.

Admittedly we have some nutcases here in europe too, but they are way less and very unorganized.

Religion isn't bad per se, however the people preaching are sometimes.
I agree. We need to destroy any organized religion that tells people how to live.
Not all religions are horrid. Buddhism exists.
The same can be said about social media, the medium isn’t the problem, it’s the people
I think if you don't force your religion on people and treat others with respect, that's one thing. I'm pagan, and it makes me feel better about my life. But I by no means want to force you into it. Cults and other bullshit need to be dismantled
I think you commented on my comment instead of the OP
Just by letting you stay in their house, they likely have created a landlord tenant relationship with you. You almost certainly have some rights against being kicked out of your home. If they've explicitly said it is due to your being trans, additional housing nondiscrimination laws could apply, but that would depend on your jurisdiction.
That means you have tenants rights and she has to evict you. That gives you some extra time to figure things out.
I don’t know your local laws but in a lot of places it is 30 days. There is a high chance she can’t actually kick you out without notice. Look up the laws.
I hate that amongst all this great advice here the most important is to be calm. 
But tbh being calm against nonsensical people is also almost always the best rebuttal (I hate it it, these people are dumb and I want to tell them that, but god damn they get disarmed quickly when you don't ark up, most of the time)

I wish I could help you, but I’m in Australia (also I’m not an adult so I think my parents would find it weird if a stranger showed up asking to live in our garage. I’ve been wanted to help friends of mine as well but can’t help them since they’re a kid and their parents won’t let them go

Did you know that you have rights? The Constitution says you do, and so do i.
Is she a tenant at will?
If you have no lease agreement, and just pay your rent every month, you are considered a “tenant-at-will.” Under Georgia law, the landlord is required to give you a notice of at least 60 days before requiring you to move out. After that, you can be evicted.
Official lease often doesn’t matter to whether you are technically a tenant. She likely can’t kick you out with no notice either way.
Lease or no lease, if you have a record of you paying her in March, you have some level of evidence you've been living there for 5 months, which is plenty enough time to establish yourself as a tenant. You are legally protected from getting kicked out for 30 days beyond when you are presented an official eviction notice. I doubt your roommate has gotten that from a judge, so if you have nowhere else to go, I would refuse to leave unless she goes before a judge to get an official eviction notice.

Edit: a caveat to this is that cops don't have to follow the law, so I would do everything in your power to avoid cops getting involved. If cops do come to remove you before there is legal standing to do so, please be careful. Say what you can to convince them you are a tenant. Have copies of payment records, text conversations stating you're living there, any mail you've gotten at the address. Anything to give them second thoughts about removing you without a proper eviction notice.

Edit 2: my number of days may be off. My state has different laws.
Depending on where you are, you may be able to get a storage unit, and find resources at a homeless shelter.

I live in Seattle, and was dumped here, and ended up in the shelter system here. I eventually got put into a program for subsidized housing. I dont know of any other places like that around the USA, but if you end up in a shelter, ask the staff and case managers if they know anything. 

I've been homeless multiple times in my life, and have had to learn to navigate things, so I hope I can share my experience to help others.
That isn’t that far, I recommend connecting with an lgbt center or group in Atlanta. They could help you more than you even know.
Then you’d be welcomed with open arms probably, I wouldn’t disclose that you’re not an addict as that might rub people the wrong way, but sometimes you have to do what you gotta do to survive.
I would put that on the bottom of the list of absolute nothing else works out only because there are people who are desperately seeking that type of housing, that being said there’s usually at least one room open per house
Contracts or not she still has renters rights that are being violated.
Right? Like, possibly not the exact wording (though even that seems close) but the circumstances. I remember it so specifically because it pounded on all my triggers like Animal on the Drums. I even hoped his person lived in the Atlanta area so I could literally violently retaliate for her, but all my messages were ignored.
I would check the subs for your area, even make a post asking about lgbt friendly shelters, you don't have to explicitly state your trans because sometimes that doesn't get much sympathy here, but if you say your getting kicked out because of religious reasons because your queer I'm sure you'd get some people offering help/information. And idk the rules about posting cash apps, your fine tho because I asked for it, it'd be different if you had already included it in the post I think.
You still have rights simply because you have been there for so long. I would figure out what they are and maybe see if you can find a pro bono lawyer. You might want to reach out to the ACLU as well. They are blatantly discriminating against you, if you can catch them on voice recording saying the things you have said they were saying you will have legal grounds for a lawsuit. I would strongly consider it to be honest. As a landlord she can’t discriminate against anyone for this reason. You could probably sue her for the value of her house plus damages and that would put you in a very good position.
In most states she has to issue you something in writing, and then if you don't leave by then, there is an eviction process that can take a bit more time, so look this info up at your city or state level (rent board, renter's rights, etc.)
I agree with that also if your in a religion and its telling you an existence is a sin thats not a religion better yet most religions are trash spiritually is the way to go
It was founded as a means of social control. The reason the Old Testament is so fire and brimstone when compared to the New Testament is because it was written in order to convince people that living in a feudal society under a lord, as well as The Lord, was the only way to live free of sin and punishment. The Catholic Church, because the Romans were quite fond of having authority, brought that fire and brimstone back to the New Testament in their preachings.  
  
There’s a common misunderstanding in social sciences and politics, where people believe that belonging to a religion gives you power. In fact, the opposite is true.  
  
Following a religion does not give preachers authority; authority gives preachers a religion to follow.
Well it's not always harmful, it's just that it's lost its original message.
Its hate that is the problem. Religious hate is hate. Religion is not an excuse to hate.

Problem is, what do you do about the children? Do you support child abuse? Do you think people should be free to abuse children? Because lying to a child, especially about eternal punishment, as is routine, is child abuse. 

We shouldn't be free to abuse children. But almost everyone wants to abuse children by lying to them about reality / sex / death. Then those abused children will grow up to abuse others. What do you do?
Proselytization is protected by the first amendment, therefore ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...."" While not religious myself, I would never dream of trying to get behind a bill that ends proselytization of religion. Rather, I would simply request a bill  that reinforced the opening clause of the first amendment, the bit about ""respecting an establishment of religion"". That is the important part of the amendment in this case, it states that religion should have no effect on lawmaking, commonly referred to as the separation of church and state.
> Bigots would just use something else to inflict their views upon others. Religion is just a handy excuse.

An outstanding majority of people are bigots because of religion, not the otherway around. 

No one is born a bigot. Being a Bigot is taught.

And Religion is the largest source of bigotry.
Religion teaches bigotry. You aren't born a bigot. I was raised in a cult.. I taught myself to read..fuck all religion
There is no teaching religion properly because religion is based on ideas of things that are not real.

There is no way for any of the monotheistic gods to exist in our universe, it simply conflicts with the observed laws of nature.

Lets put it this way, in a context we can all understand here. 

Some people think being trans is a choice, despite all the evidence to the contrary.

Now how would you feel if a school, or federally/publicly funded entity was teaching that? Even if it was a really nice place and teaching people to be tolerate and loving, you still have something that is false being taught.

Gods are not real, they should NEVER be taught as real. They literally defy the laws of nature. They cannot exist.

Therefore they shouldnt be taught as anything more than figments of the imagination, no more real than Harry Potter or Stranger Things.

There is no way to teach religion properly because you have to teach something that does not exist as a point of reality. Which is not what education is for.

Everything positive about religion already exists in human nature itself. We can teach empathy without teaching about Jesus. We can teach humility without teaching about Yaweh. We can teach respecting others and differences without Allah. 

There is no need for religion, to teach human decency.

There are, however, serious problems with teaching people to believe in delusions.
You aren't born religious, don't even start to equate the two.
All things positive about religion are inherent to human nature. There is no need to teach about Jesus to teach people to love each other unconditionally. 

Religion is almost exclusively a negative influence, and actively teaches people to believe in delusions. 

All that is positive about humanity, can and does already exist without religion.
This is easily the most well informed and well thought out comment in this thread. We are taught from a young age that we need to pay attention to history because it repeats itself, while that's not quite true, history definitely rhymes, but doesn't repeat. Comments like this are why, although slightly inaccurate, the old adage is important.

As much as it sucks to be misgendered or discriminated against, the ideas your comment address are why it doesn't destroy me when someone hurts me because I'm not cis.
Where do atheists get their moral compass?
I did my bad ✌🏾
This! People need to know their rights!
Rules for tenants renting a apartment/house can vary vastly from rules where the “tenant” is renting a room. Especially if there isn’t a written contract. They also vary by region Texas and Florida will have very different laws compared to Oregon and California. Rural vs urban location will also have very different local laws.

I’d be very careful advising someone renting to force the owner to evict them. It’s a short term solution that can have significant long term consequences. Having an eviction can make it very hard to get someone to rent to you and when they are willing it will almost always cost significantly more.

A better response here is to recommend shelters and to work with her roommates to get more time. Staying beyond a date and claiming squatters rights without a clear understanding of the law is recipe for disaster. Including forceful removal by law enforcement.
Sounds like it may be unsafe to stay anyway. What if the roommate gets violent, or changes the locks when OP is out, or gets rid of all their stuff. Better to find someplace to go and get out.
Which she may not lawfully be able to do. You cannot evict someone on the grounds of gender identity unless you are personally renting fewer than 5 rooms in a home you occupy. So it depends on whether all 3 roommates are on the lease or whether one is the landlord for the other two.
She told me I had 30 days is that what you mean
I completely misread the THC acronym as meaning the drug, and took me way too long to realise you weren't referring to that
THC is on my... wait, what was I saying... Where are the chips?
I'm pretty sure she's been playing this for a while cuz she demanded I always pay her directly cash
Yeah, you're right, but I don't think that would be a good place to keep leaving.
I desperately want to be out before the eviction starts because it marks you and I'll have a harder time finding a home
How do you suppose you know what ""the original message"" is? Religion was made up by people.
This is very important to state. Else we become just like them with being in an echo chamber of hate and acceptance of such actions.
I was raised in a cult. It ruined my life. It took most of my life away and I'll never get it back. All organized religion needs to die.
I wish I had the answer.  All I can do is promote mental health care, education, forgiveness, and be there to listen to people that are afraid.
That's bad people using religion as a shield. I grew up in a fairly conservative religious town and everything we were taught in church was about tolerance and helping. I also know that's no the norm. But it should be. Those people believed in using religion as a Beacon of hope for those who were lost and that was it. We weren't told about all the hellfire and damnation. Probably why I find that teaching within religions appalling.
The problem isn’t religion or its suppression. Complotists do the same shit without religion. What you want is a well-founded, reliable public education system able to teach people an experience-based, critical relation to knowlege.
Nah, fuck it. If they're an organized religion it needs to die. Let people be spiritual and stuff not no organizations

You've got it backwards. Their bigotry would be learned anyway. Faith is not the source of bigotry, but the teachings of institutions of faith. If you were to do nothing but hand someone the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, bigotry would be the furthest thing from their mind.  It's the teachings of the Church, shaped not by faith but by millenia of its use as a tool of power, that have created Christian bigotry. The Nazis, the Soviets, the PRC, all atheist states that perpetuated cycles of bigotry based on things that had nothing to do with religion. In the early 20th century, there was _science_-based bigotry (pseudoscientific but still, there are people to this day who believe in that bullshit.) If we didn't have Christianity we'd just have something else being used.
Not religious myself, but the claim of “god is not real” is just as unfalsifiable as the claim “god is real”. Both have the burden of proof, and it’s just impossible to prove one way or the other
This is clearly something you've thought a lot about...

You've pretty much explained exactly why I think it needs to be reorganized lol. Religion and the belief in the existence of higher powers needs to be taught as accepting and optional.

However, I disagree with the idea that the existence of, or belief in, religion is an inherently bad thing or delusional. It's a shame that *fanatics* are given so much voice, and that there are so many of them, but the religious people in my family are some of the most accepting and kind people I have ever met.

And I never said that it should be taught in schools, that's just stupid. Religion and general education should be completely separate.
This is exactly correct.
I’m not equating being religious with being LGBTQ+. I’m comparing the outlook LGBTQ+ people have on religion with the outlook religious people have on the LGBTQ+ community. And obviously not all religious people are against the community. And obviously not all LGBTQ people are against religion. I’m making a broad comparison between two broad groups.
No that's just false. We are duality of animal and consciousness. Yes unconditional love is in us all but so is vitriolic hate and premeditated murder. Those aren't from religion but nature. We hunted and killed both animals and each other for survival. The primary motivator in humans doing good or bad is the external environment. Forgive my assumption but I assume you're from a western society? 2000 years of Jesus has permeated our culture to the point where we inherently believe things other people didn't or still don't. (Like even down to liner time it's crazy most societies had a cyclical view of time) I find a lot of atheists who think their goodness is inherently all their own (because no one wants to be bad it's ok) but it's actually thousands of years of culture before you that instilled these things into the fiber of your being. And I'm not saying you can't be atheist... I respect it as a world view, but you are incorrect about the total impact of religion. The Modern Christian particularly in the US I find to be rather regressive and intolerant but it's disingenuous to act as if there are no ages where Christians were the progressive force. And every other religion too for that matter has had many shares of progressivism and ridiculous stagnation. The only common variables here are humans, the undeniable duality of animal instinct and consciousness and Darwinian limitations.
it can be taught or they can make their own moral compass. But i dont get your point
Just be careful since she is religious and people do crazy things. The law can be slow and not kind to anyone even if you are in the right.
30 days might be enough notice but there is often a full process to evict someone that can give you some more time. And depending on local laws 30 days might not be enough notice. I don’t know all the relevant stuff about Georgia though. Look at your local housing laws and also see if there is an LGBT center or some other group you can reach out to that might be able to give you more specific advice.
they likely need to give you a written notice for it to be legit
I’d be very careful listening to people telling you to force her to evict you. Legal Evictions stay on your record similar to bankruptcy. And similar to bankruptcy they can make it much more difficult to rent a future place or even get someone to rent you a room. When they do it will cost more.

The legal protections that existed during the pandemic allowing people to stay rent free in their apartments and preventing landlord from evicting tenants do not exist anymore. I live one of the more progressive states and the last of those protections expired in January. 

If you don’t have a written contract your going to have an even more difficult time establishing a tenant/landlord relationship. Furthermore you’re renting a room in a house she owns and occupies. The rules for these situations give the homeowner even more protections in situations like this. 

Essentially it’s very likely that even in the most progressive states and localities the very most you have is 60 days after she’s given you written notice that you must move. Because you’re renting a room in a house she occupies it’s far more likely that you have 30 days. If you aren’t out by then she can have law enforcement forcefully remove you (although she does have to store your belongings according to local laws). If you have a written rental contract she will need to have given you written and dated notice. However, a text message will suffice for this in some locations. 

All of this is predicated on you having a written rental contract. Without that it’s your word against hers in many ways. Law enforcement isn’t the greatest when it comes to knowing the law. And in their eyes you aren’t likely to be the sympathetic party.

In short I’d highly recommend you look at local shelters, contact a local charity, and your cities housing assistance program if they have one. Talk to friends about couch surfing. As well as look for rooms to rent with written rental contracts. Your time is better spent trying to find another place to stay than trying to outstay your welcome in your current place.

I’d also appeal to her and see if she can give you a few more days beyond the 30 as you’d be homeless otherwise.
Another recommendation I have would be to message her with something baiting her into saying you've been living there since March. Something like ""when I helped pay the down payment in March, you said I could stay here if I paid x rent per month."" If she responds with anything other than full outright denial, that's useful in showing your tenant status.
Show your ATM withdrawals, your bank account withdrawals, any text conversations you've had about living there. You have more protections than you think.
She could sue for a big fat wadge of money tho. Or for other reasons like getting a restraining order. Having that lawsuit show up on the transphobic persons background search could help protect other renters.
Yes. Well, check at your local colleges for listings, go to your local LGBTQ Center and ask if they have any resources or referrals or know anyone that does. If you are told someone can't help, ask them if they know who can.
Well, by the original message, I'm mostly talking about things like what Jesus said and stuff like that. He only wanted the best for everyone. And the Bible originally never contained any bigotry. Only through translations was it made to antagonize gay people. To be honest, if you want proof that religion isn't all bad, look at the current pope. Popes usually get palaces and riches when they are elected, but this one refused because he felt it inappropriate to live in riches if Jesus was born in poverty. He praises equality and is an ally to the lgbtq+ community. Unlike other popes, he is very engaged with people. Usually, popes travel in a glass box to protect from assassination and stuff like this but he refused to do so to remain connected with people. He even actually accepted a drink from someone! Think about it, it could've been poisoned, lots of people could want him dead! The amount of trust he has in people is remarkable.
Yeah. It's important to remember that there are religious people in the LGBTQ+ community and saying religion should be dismantled is really not helping. Religion was never supposed to be bad. Heck, religion isn't bad at all. It's just some people within those groups that can be harmful. Most are good.
This isn’t an equal equivalence. Spiritual thinking is an active hindrance to the scientific method and any progress derived from it, religion always has and will always continue to be used to justify bigotry and violence against others.
[deleted]
Yeah.. they always teach that..but when it comes down to it they're only nice to people that act how they do or want to act how they do.
Were you told that when you die that you will continue on in some conscious form? Because that’s not true and it’s a very important part of life to get right. All evidence we have, which has been hard-won, is that when you die you’re utterly destroyed. If they lied to you about that then that’s very significant! Even without the hellfire. The main problem is the lying.
That's the thing, it really doesn't only effect Americans. Many other countries have the same protections in place as the first amendment does in their societies, just worded differently. I personally agree with you that freedom from persecution and of assembly need to be 100% universal, but religion is something people can be persecuted for, and proselytization being outlawed is religious persecution, as it is a part of many religious texts to do so. Religion is also not the problem, absolutism is.

I say all of this as a non religious person, by the way. I will never actively argue for or against religious belief, even though some points I make can be interpreted that way.
You can't prove a negative, like proving god doesn't exist. We can look at the observable universe and say god doesn't appear to exist because there is no proof. The burden of proof is on the person making the claim that god does exist. People didn't think germs existed, but then we found proof they did. People thought that atoms were the smallest things to exist, but then we found evidence that they aren't. So until someone can show evidence that things like gods, or ghosts, or an afterlife, or anything like that exists, we can assume they don't.
God is not real can be proven by the extremely large body of evidence that points to naturalism. If there is a god, they've done absolutely nothing of note for the past 13.7 billion years. The proof is that we see absolutely nothing verifiable to indicate there is a god. 

Sure, there may be a god that just does nothing, but that's for all intents and purposes identical to no god, so it's functionally the same result
Depends on the god. You can absolutely say any tri-omni god doesn't exist, because a tri-omni god cannot logically exist.
No., That's not how that works. The burden of proof is only on the ones making the claim something is real that can't be proven. Saying something isn't real that has literally no proof, doesn't need any evidence.
> However, I disagree with the idea that the existence of, or belief in, religion is an inherently bad thing or delusional.

All organized religions rely on believing in a delusion. An Ethereal being is inherently a delusion, because it is not real.

If someone believed in Harry Potter as a real person and presented the HP books as proof Harry was real... That person would be delusional. Imagine them trying to prove that HP was real because some of it happens in a real location somewhere in the UK.

The very same can be said about God and the bible, Allah and the Quran, Yaweh and the Torah, so on and so forth.

Religions are acceptable delusions. That is how they work.

But the thing about religions that are especially problematic is that so many religions actively seek to discriminate against and kill LGBT people and have done so for thousands of years.
Unfortunately thé lier will find another media to spread bullshit. Religion is infected because it's Big organisation, but you'll find stupidity in every organisation. Socialism is not a religion but you'll find weak human using it to (illogicaly) defend bullshit liké capitalism or patriarchy. 
Even thé belief in science Can be twisted to spread obvious bullshit. 

It would bé too easy to just admit religion is thé problem and you just need to fight it. Everything Can be a problem if we don't pay enough attention. 
I think religion need reformation, yes. And today's Big ""religious"" organisation have fall into evil hand long long ago. But let's bé carefull because it will happen in every Big organisation
By this logic saying something along the lines of “all cops are bastards” is just as bad as outright racism even though one of those things is a profession you choose and can leave and the other is an inherent trait of your birth
> No that's just false. We are duality of animal and consciousness. 

No it's not.

It's clear you have absolutely no background in Anthropology. You have absolutely no idea what humans are naturally inclined to be and do.

Religion is not a driver of human decency.
Why do we need religion as a moral compass when you can reach moral principles without it?
That's right, I didn't even though about that, but shouldn't she be thinking where is she going to stay first?
Nope. https://qz.com/511809/pope-francis-is-not-a-progressive-he-just-has-terrific-pr/
It's too bad that people somehow distort the message which is supposed to be about love and compassion for your fellow human being into one of hate and bigotry.
Religion it’s isn’t the problem, it’s the people who decide they don’t like something and twist their religion to justify their hatred then spread it
Yes, dismantling it is a bit too far

tbh it should just be reformed in some capacity, because there is no simple way in ending the bigotry and harm it can cause, even if the people who do it are in the minority
Exactly
Thank you.
I mean that's a normal tenant of all religions that there is some form of an afterlife. But that's more of a philosophical question since the only way to truly know is to die and stay dead.

All most all of my religious up bring was about being respectful and tolerant of those that are different.
That's kind of the entire concept of faith though. Believing in something you can't prove so... 

I mean it's cool all of you guys think you have it figured out. But like you said you can't prove it, but you can't disprove it either. 🤷‍♂️
You can prove a negative. For example, I can say “there is no milk in my fridge.” And we can go open my fridge to find there’s no milk. It’s not that negatives can’t be proven, it’s that we have no ways to go about measuring “god” or the “supernatural” however you wanna define that.
Proofs only exist in maths, in science, we have evidence. That said the absence of evidence does not equate to the evidence of absence. To say that the evidence of a hypothetical(in the scientific sense of the word) deity not existing is the fact that we have not found evidence is ignoring the point of science. I'm not religious because there is no evidence that there is a deity(or more than one), but I do not say there are no deities because there is no evidence that one or more do not exist.

Quick and overly simplified explanation of the scientific method:
1) a question is posed
2) a hypothesis is made based on observations related to the question
3) the researcher(s) organize(s) a study to disprove the hypothesis
4) the results of the study are analyzed
5) two things can happen here: a) the hypothesis is supported by the evidence -or- b) the evidence does not support the hypothesis
6) more studies to see if the results can be replicated, preferably by peers
7) again two mutually exclusive events: a) the results are replicated and the supported hypothesis is made theory(this is when something is seen as true in the scientific community, not like when a lay person says theory which is analogous with the concept of hypothesis for some reason) -or- b) the results are not replicated and the process starts over at step one.
We really can't prove that a god doesn't exist, there is no proof. We can only use our current observations of the universe as we know it to surmise there is no god due to lack of evidence that one does exist. It's not proof that there is no god, just lack of proof that there is one. 

And I agree, if there was a god, they created the universe then moved on, or they just like to watch the universe and see how it goes, like some sort of simulation or ant farm.
I've heard this said this way.
""If god existed, there would be proof. But you can't prove something that doesn't exist.""
If God existed, there would already be some sort of proof, but there isn't. 

I have yet to find a person whose life hasn't been negatively impacted by Catholicism or Christianity derived religions (the only type of religion I've met). My grandmother is very religious and has always been miserable for as long as I've known her because she says she's ""impure, bad and undeserving"". She spends her time reading up on how to justify her deteriorating and declining self esteem. My mother has forgiven and accepted toxic family members back into her life because of religion. My father is agnostic, so his only issues are his traumas, undiagnosed ASD and untreated anger issues. One of my mother's sisters, that was a single mother doing pretty well by herself even though she's always been a piece of trash, literally stopped having any agency when she married her now husband because of his religion, for which my cousin D (who is my age, btw) and her middle brother J (11 years younger than her) had to pay the price, while the youngest is a pampered little shit. My aunt literally has to sneak around to be able to visit her own fucking family. Her husband has physically assaulted her at least once. Not that I have any sympathy for her whatsoever (for several reasons), but my point about religion still stands.

I have never in my scarce 21 years of life and 17 years of consciousness seen any sign pointing towards the existence of the ""loving, caring"" and also ""omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent"" god I was raised to believe in. I have pleaded and begged for help from this supposed force of goodness, and have gotten no response, even when I had faith. Even when I clung to the faith I was raised in because otherwise I'd feel cheated and betrayed. I've never been given any indication that my faith was helping. I do not hate all people who practice religion. I love my mother. I love her mother. I love my father's mother. I appreciate the kind nuns that live in the church near my house that would brighten up my grandmother's face when she couldn’t walk to church. I like all my cousins on my father's side and they're all Catholic. I like my father's sister. I have a friend who is a devoted Catholic, just like the rest of her family. But I love them despite their religion, not regardless of it. It sounds bad, but I can't love a part from you that has brought so much damage upon my family and loved ones. D was like a sister to me and her mother's religion and decisions took her away from me. Religion prevents me from seeing my grandmother's smile. It almost killed my cousin's wife (they're anti birth control and my cousin's wife had SIX C-SECTIONS when the maximum tou can have is three. She nearly died).

If there was a God, there would be proof. But there isn't one. So there's none.
To play Devil’s Advocate for God (lol), They’ve done nothing we can measure is the caveat. God could be affecting us and our universe in ways we can’t measure with our understanding of the universe we live in.
[deleted]
What does the God being tri-omni have anything more or less to do with it logically existing? That's the whole point of God being God. Existing outside your rules of logic.
The burden of proof is on anyone making a claim period. If I say the Earth is flat, I need to give evidence to back that up. If I say the Earth is round, I need to give evidence to back that up as well. The ability to prove has nothing to do with the burden of proof
Ok I'm going to step in, I probably shouldn't but hey, whatever.

While yes, religion does play a part in a lot of people's arguments as to why they do one thing or another, what does it matter. It doesn't affect you whether they worship a god or not. The only reason that these things happen are because people hate new thing even if there is a reason to the new thing. People will use every reason they can think up of to oppose what they want to oppose so why should we dismantle something that does no harm
A big organization based explicitly on lies is in a worse position than one not based on lies. There really are unique problems that happen when the core of an institution is false.
Again, the ONLY thing I’m arguing about is the thought process/viewpoint. I’m not arguing towards or against this person’s point. I’m not saying they are bad or good for their viewpoint. I am not speaking of the circumstances surrounding the opinions of this person or anyone else. I am definitely not talking about cops. I am simply pointing out that I’ve seen Religious people who have this exact thought process towards the Community. At worst I’m making a value neutral statement, and I am drawing no conclusions from said statement.
Compelling argument. I see you're hard on the search for the truth and not mired in dogma like those darn Christians lmao
Who say we need religion as moral compass?
Well crap. My point still stands though. Not all are like this. It's an exception.
THIS. Imaginary friends don't hurt people. If someone decides their imaginary friend doesn't like me or something I'm doing, and then uses that to justify persecuting or otherwise harming me, the problem is that person, not their imaginary friend. Blaming religion for what people do under its banner is like if someone kicked the shit out of me and I blamed the shoes they were wearing while they did it.

Religion is a way to clothe hatred to make it look different.
Do you think the sun will rise tomorrow? What are the odds? 50/50? How could anyone know, after all the only way to know is to actually go to tomorrow and no one has done that yet. And yet, I would take a bet at a billion to one odds that the sun will rise tomorrow. It is in fact possible to have well calibrated beliefs about things that no one has yet experienced. And the death thing is about as solid as the sun rising tomorrow.

Just because the idea of an afterlife is a ""normal"" tenent of religion doesn't make it sane or not child abuse, or not lying. We know what happens when people die, dammit, as well as we can know anything in this world, and it's not good to lie to children about it!
But you can't prove lots of things definitively. The lack of evidence suggests that there is no god, and until someone has some sort of proof, it's safe to say there is no god. That's typically how science works. We come up with an idea, test it, and see what the results are. If more tests are done, say with newer technology, and new results are shown, we go with that. Religions claim that god exists, so the burden of proof is on them. If they can't prove it, they are wrong. 

And yes, faith is believing in something that can't be proven, very convenient. Science is believing in something that can't be proven wrong. I'll stick with science.

All Glory to the Flying Spaghetti Monster. May you be touched by his noodly appendages. R'amen.
That's completely true. My previous statements failed to address this properly. That's on me. Also I shouldn't have equated strong evidence to proof, though the colloquial use of proof is a synonym from my experience 

In this context though, there's two competing arguments: there is a god, and there is no god. In my opinion, naturalism would be the best contender for no god (natural events sufficiently explain things. For deism, they have no verifiable evidence to disprove naturalism, yet every piece of evidence points towards naturalism. With this, we can conclude that there is either a) no god, or b) a god that doesn't do anything observable. With Occam's razor, we can say that naturalism has less required factors. As such, naturalism is probably more likely. If naturalism is more likely, deism is less likely, and there's probably no god. 

Then there's all the other philosophical arguments that compound this to the point that logic and lack of evidence *together* point towards no god.  Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, but it can be a factor when the evidence is supposed to be obvious.

There's always the possibility of a god that doesn't interact with the universe, but then that's just like saying I've got an invisible purple dragon that's impossible to interact with. Sure it's theoretically possible, but it's completely useless so even if it's true, it's unfalsifiable and inherently unscientific since falsifiability is crucial to science
The only god that is possible given the evidence is indeed nothing but a first mover or casual observer. Which for all intents and purposes is the same as no god. I'd argue that that's proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

I'd say that if all presented evidence for a god is disproven, that would be proof by contradiction, as is used in maths proofs, but I can understand why that may not always be convincing.
So there's two options:

1. there's no god and that fits what we see
2. There is a god that does nothing visible, and so it looks like there's no god

That's like saying I've got an invisible dragon that rubs its socks on an invisible carpet in the sky causing lightning when people aren't looking. Sure it's possible, but it takes more assumptions to explain something that way than in a naturalistic manner
Dude something that is logically impossible is by definition impossible. 1+1≠3. logic is by definition objective. Logical missteps are the only subjective part.

On larger things like morality, logic may lead to multiple possibilities, but all logically coherent arguments are by definition objective
Did you read?

You do know that there are types of mythology without a tri-omni god, right? Christianity isn't the only religion.

They aren't ""my rules,"" they're basic ideas. Nothing can exist that completely contradicts itself. If he knows about evil and can make that stop without any new problems, yet he doesn't, he is not good. If he can't stop that evil, then he is not all-powerful. Either way, he cannot be all three.

Lastly, if the murderer in the sky doesn't confirm to what is possible, then you or any other person who believes don't get to make any claims about him. If I can't argue against your claim because it defies basic logic, you can't argue for him on the same grounds. A claim that can only be evidenced in one direction is not a valid claim.
That is what I said.
It matters because you can't THINK properly if you're lying to yourself about reality, and the existance of a god is a BIG LIE about reality. You can directly trace a lot of present-day dysfunction to people not being able to think about death properly, and a huge amount is because religion is constantaly lying to people and saying that they don't actually die when they die.

The person who doesn't believe in climate change? A lot of that is because they think that god is ultimately in control.

As Voltaire said, ""if they can make you believe absurdities, they can make you commit atrocities"". That's why allowing huge lies to fester is a big problem.
I'm LGBT+ and religious. 

I don't see thé problem. 

You'll just have to bé mature and use your brain. 


People with pearl necklace pretending to bé religious but spreading hate are not religious people. Just shitty people using religion as an excuse. It's blasphemy. Saint Peter IS not fooled, and I'm not either.
I'm a Biological Anthropologist. So yes, I am very much interested in how humanity really works and how we got here.

Anthropology isn't some sideways western ideal. It is a field of science, with an enormous amount of data that provides what is real about humanity. 

You can laugh as much as you want, but you cannot paint a science as an ideology, when it is a field of active ongoing and important research. One that has been one of the most powerful drivers of the breaking down of racism, discrimination, and education of peoples around the world.

Anthropology is the field of science that most celebrates human diversity, and is most interested in why people are different and yet the same. Without evidence that Anthropology has provided, it would be nearly impossible for people to combat systemic racism, and discrimination.

Anthropology is one of the biggest reasons why we have social progress and understanding of diversity.
…you did
It's really not an exception.
Yep this for some reason a good amount of some types of religions seem to have been corrupted for some reason no tho
Im saving your comment. Its way more eloquent than i can put it with the beautiful and perfect metaphor.
Maybe I should come from this tact. I have a child. She is about to be 7. She has not really attended any church services as of yet. She has been introduced to the concept of religion and she asks me some questions that I can't really answer, mainly because for me these topics are to abstract for her age and because I want religion to be a choice for her not an indoctrination.

The thing about my religious education is it was all at my own volition. I was close to about 13 when I decided to start attending service with my friends family. My religious upbringing before that was my Catholic Father teaching me about it. Mostly the history of religion and its effects on the world over the course of time both good and bad.

Lying is complicated. The truth is complicated. Lying to kids is not child abuse. Now gas lighting your kids by Lying is. But lies like Santa clause, the tooth fairy, the Easter bunny and so on aren't harmful. It adds mystery to the world and can entrench curiosity in a kids mind.

As kids get older you pull away the curtain but in doing so you reveal a better truth. Gratitude for gifts received. Memories of the joy spent with family and the fun of the events. If you have younger kids maybe get the older sibling in on the events so that they still can participate in the fun.

An afterlife is not a guarantee. I have never thought of it as such. But I take comfort in knowing that this might not be it. It doesn't de-motivate me from being curious about all things whatever they maybe whether its how quantum gravity works or the details of how life starts from nothing but a collection of proto-amino acids. I also live my life cautiously because I don't want to die.

I get your point that at a young age some of these teachings could be harsh for young children but I'm in no way advocating young kids be indoctrinated into church.
You can stick with your safe answers. If that's what you want to believe. I'll keep believing in God, thanks.
I'm not arguing for deism(not in a meaningful way, I don't have a dog in that fight lol), but I will say Occam's Razor and other shortcuts have no place in science, imho. Shortcuts have a nasty tendency of skewing data in or against favour of hypothesis rather than evidence. The most colloquial way I have heard Occam's Razor summed up is the hoofbeats in Central Park analogy*, and it reveals the inherent flaw in the principle. The universe is massive and ever expanding, so naturalism has a place in it for some form of divinity. As we have seen here on earth, 'zebras' happen all the time, in many different contexts where OR would have one assume said 'zebra' doesn't exist.

I happen to agree that the evidence shows us the extreme likelihood that no such entity exists nor ever has. I'm just saying, through a scientific lens, it is irresponsible to say there is or isn't one or many.

I personally like the idea of a world without morality drawn from religion. I don't think it is necessary for that to be the source of them and see all the atrocities that people hiding behind it have committed as evidence that it serves to undermine society when allowed to be public far more than it helps. I think religion should only ever be a private personal matter, meaning no proselytization, no churches, no religious schools, no books. Only private worship, that is done when alone. So basically meditation, lol. 

*For those unfamiliar with the analogy: When you hear hoofbeats in Central Park, you're not looking for zebras.
I suppose I just don't see the lack of evidence as a definitive ""does not exist"". God could exist, we just have never seen any proof. I suppose this is almost more of a philosophical topic than scientific. There aren't really any wrong answers. Well, there is one: an invisible man in the sky that no one can see controls the lives of humans.
I’m not saying it’s not ridiculous, but if a god IS interacting in our universe in ways we can’t measure, it does mean it is real, just that we can’t interact with it in any way.
That’s what I’m talking about. Religion is a larger concept where logic has lead to thousands of possibilities.
If that’s what you said then you agree with me
Nope, pls read the comment again, i say ""it gives pepole same belifes and a moral compass"" wich its not the same thing
Well my sister's gf has religious beliefs and she's one of the best people I know in the world.
Pretty much all religions have, at some point and to some degree. I mean, there have been Buddhist terrorists, ffs. People are people, and unfortunately, people often suck.
Awe, thanks -- it's so nice to hear that someone found it useful! 💜
Of course, please believe what you want to. I am not trying to argue that you are wrong, just what I believe based on what I and others have seen in the natural world. As long as you allow others to believe what they want, and you don't push your beliefs onto others, I have no problems. 

As a Pastafarian, I follow the 8 ""I''d Really Rather You Didn'ts"", the first being ""I’d really rather you didn’t act like a sanctimonious, holier-than-thou ass when describing my Noodly Goodness. If some people don’t believe in me, that’s okay. Really, I’m not that vain. Besides, this isn’t about them so don’t change the subject.""

We all have the right to our own belief systems, please just don't try and make me do what your god says.
I agree that Occam's razor isn't ideal in science, but it's also sometimes useful. I prefer the simplification of the most simple answer is *most likely* to be correct. For example, there could be rain because of natural evaporation, or there could be aliens injecting water vapour into the air and stealing water when nobody is looking. The alien thing is possible, but it's way more complicated with no more explaining power, so it can be dismissed until there's better evidence. In the same way, a deity controlling stuff perfectly to look exactly like causation is more complex than simple causation, so it can be dismissed unless there's better evidence. The less complex one is assumed true unless there's reason to believe otherwise. As such, there is no god can be assumed to be true as it's simpler than there is a god. That doesn't mean we should stop looking though
The principle of Occam's razor applies here. In essence, the most simple explanation is most likely right.

Example: Someone has a headache. The simplest answer is that it's benign and probably nothing. Assuming it's benign is the correct assumption as it's the simplest and thus most likely, but of course there's situations where it could actually be a tumour. Still, you shouldn't assume you have a brain tumour just because you have a headache. Doesn't mean you shouldn't investigate though.

In the same way, there's no proof for god that isn't better explained by natural processes, so it would be illogical to say god exists without any verifiable evidence. However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't look for a god, just that believing in one with our current knowledge would be irrational
Of course :) for all intents and purposes we should act as if there's no god. Or if you want to act as though there is a god, you'd have to worship the one with the absolute worst punishment possible to minimize your suffering in case you get it wrong since there's no evidence to show which one/ones would be right. Anything else would be illogical
Yeah but the tri omni god (omnipotent, omnibenevolent, omniscient) is logically impossible.

 If they're omnipotent and omniscient, they should know how to make a world with less suffering than this one and be able to, but since we live in this world, they can't be omnibenevolent

 If they're omnibenevolent and omniscient, they'd want to reduce harm further and know how, but clearly there's harm so they can't be omnipotent

If they're omnibenevolent and omnipotent, they'd want to reduce suffering and be capable of making a world with less suffering. Since we live in this world with plenty of suffering, they must not know how, so they can't be omniscient.

By definition, you can't be all loving (Omnibenevolent), all knowing (omniscient) and all powerful (omnipotent) with the observation of the world we live in.
Um. No. Any religion based on a tri-omni god (that is, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent) is a concept where logic being ignored has lead to people thinking of thousands of possibilities.

If something has self-contradictory traits, it is inherently impossible. A tri-omni god is impossible because if it truly has everyone's best interests at heart, is all-powerful, evil exists and it knows of that evil, that being is impossible. If it is truly all-powerful, it could solve every issue without any problems coming up. If it can't do that, it isn't all-powerful.
Now I doubt my own self and what I said and I'm too lazy to reread it lol
She can be one of the best people in the world even if she doesn't have religious belief!
Wouldn't dream of it. I respect all walks of life. Good can be derived from all types of spirituality even ones that don't have a God or Gods. And I agree. Not a single person is better than another based off beliefs.
This is the best possible phrasing, I think lol. Now we just need to tell a story, because as a race of storytellers that's how we learn change and grow. Science is beautiful and complicated and does not negate religion like many think it does, but until scientists become storytellers too, or work with them, it will continue to be difficult to have thoughtful discourse on scientific principles. 

We have to balance the logos with the pathos and the ethos, not just focus on one area, when that happens we have God vs No God and people don't like hearing that. They tend to shut down and produce circular, unfalsifiable, points to try and fuel their position and usually walk away either feeling like they were right or just resentful of the person delivering the information, and therefore not receptive to the possibility that it might be true.

It's also difficult to explain to a person that the concept we call nothing is a real quantifiable (no)thing *and* is inherently unstable *and* is likely the reason the universe exists. So any help here would be amazing, non horror writers of reddit, if you please? Lol
I agree completely. 

And if we do find god, say in the center of our galaxy, and he wants our starship, we should always ask ourselves ""What does God need with a starship?"". ^(Sorry, feeling a little bit silly tonight)
I’d say your right, but I wouldn’t tell any religious person they’re illogical, tends not to go over well XD
You exist, don’t you? And you’re actively fighting. I don’t follow any sort of god, but with all of us as fighting spirits it’s proof of good in the world. 

I’d rather not talk about this anymore honestly. This whole hateful comment section doesn’t do any good for my mental health, like you’d think a group of people like this would be able to separate the idea of bad people vs a bad institution, or be able to respect people they don’t understand. 

I’m met with hypocrisy in this community every day, but I think I’ve officially had enough. Like I knew being too deep in any community would get me here, but I wanted hope.
Then you and I are friends.

happy birthday, to the two cutest kings ever :3 /pos ✨🖤
Can I just say real quick how much I loved how the transition was done in Umbrella Academy. I rewatched it recently and it was just addressed, accepted, and the story moved on. No unnecessary attention was drawn to it. It didn't pull away from the story at all. There was no fuss. It just happened, and then the story just existed with the change.
Happy birthday to 2 kings 🔥🏳️‍⚧️🎉
Happy birthday!!! 🥳🎂🎉🎈🎇
Happy birthday!
happy birthday big bros

2 months into HRT and I’m still just happy to be… me!		"I love your hair and glasses 🤩, super cute!
Your hair is absolutely gorgeous; It’s so nice to see short-haired trans girls represented , and makes me feel way better about my asymmetric undercut
You are pretty
The. GLASSES. I love THEM!
As you should be. 🙂
Cute!
Lookin good sister!
❤️🌞😍
You have a very “Britney spears” look about you, especially in your smile. You’re pretty.
[removed]
Congratulations!❤️
You look Amazing.
I'm at a similar point, started 06/06/21. It's been amazing
You look like you'd be a really friendly nurse
rocking the hair !!!
Thanks so much!  
I wish my hair would grow faster! haha
I thought I was the only one! It’s one of the best for being distinguished between a gay guy, and a lesbian.
Hehe thanks 😊 
I’ll be honest it’s only this short because I am still trying to grow it.
6 months ago it was a short undercut so it’s growing fairly quickly ❤️
Naw thanks ☺️
Thank you!
I’ve never found glasses I loved so much.
It was one of the first “girl” things I got for myself and it really did step up my look I think 😇
Thank you 😊
😇
Thank you sweetheart 😍
😘😁
Thank you!
I try to look bright and sunny.
I used to be quite dark etc and I attribute that to my depression so I distance myself from that kind of look :)

Hopefully I don’t actually end up like poor Britney 😬
Bruh.  Being cis doesn't mean you get a hotness bonus or should expect to look hotter than us.  I know where you're coming from, but like, take about 10-15% off there bud.
Thanks sweetheart ❤️
Thank you 🥰
I’m really happy with my changes so far!
Right!?
Some days are hard to see the changes but you look back on “before” photos and it really opens your eyes.
I hope it is going well for you sis.
I won’t pretend it’s a walk in the park (I am soooo emotional now) but it’s definitely positive overall.
PM me if you need someone to talk to 😘
Hehe thanks!
Yeah… I could see myself being a friendly nurse 😅
Thank you! I am really lucky with my hair <3 :)
I just realized I am a trans woman this week, and I am only a few weeks into a fresh masculine hair cut 🙁.  Your hair looks adorable.
Also, I like it because it challenges the idea that long hair = femininity.
I’m in a similar situation; I guess since it only grows at a certain rate (even with hrt etc) it just helps to find some way to enjoy it before it gets into that awkward middle-length stage . But seriously sis, that style you’re rocking is criminally underrated and you are absolutely killing it
You look so good in them! Good eye!  (get it? glasses? good eye? heh)
Hey, at least things are looking better for her right now. Her dad resigned from her conservatorship. I hope things look better for you too <3
Thank you!! So sorry for being extra!
For me it seems like every two weeks I notice something. The first dose I felt in just an hour, then two weeks in my mental health and mood took a sharp and sudden turn upwards, four weeks and I noticed my skin was super soft, six weeks in the ol' nip pain started, and now eight weeks in I have titty bitty boobs, nothing to write home about but enough to hold the band of my sports bra down when I raise my arms. In two more weeks I'm going to have my follow up appointment and see about going from 2mg E a day to 4mg E. I'm very excited!
I was the same.  
Shaved sides...  


It takes a while to grow out...  
Best thing I did was get some blonde put through it when it started getting a bit longer. Does a lot to feminize my look :)
Just went through the same thing. I got a haircut in late June and then came out as trans at the end of July. Fortunately cancelled a haircut literally the day before my egg cracked. 

If you want my to talk I’m here. We are probably not far off in timing. Got my intake phone screen on Tuesday!
Thanks so much sweetheart!
I am doing the best I can with what I got and I think I’m doing ok haha!
Still can’t wait for some more length but all I can do is wait for it to grow 😅
hehehe  
Very funny xx ;)
Yeah I really feel for the poor girl.

I hope things look better for me soon as well ❤️
That sounds like awesome progress sis!
Nice work I am so happy for you!
My timeline is similar but the booby pain started at 4 weeks for me.
They are so sore and sensitive! They sting so much if I am cold hahah

My mental health is better but I think that’s more about being out, not from the E.
The E is making me extremely emotional which is something I am struggling with a lot.

I hope you are enjoying your journey sis.. it’s amazing overall but has its ups and downs ❤️
Yeah.  I like it 🙂
Thank you for the offer 😊!
So true. Can’t complain about extra length but can definitely complain about waiting!
Thank you! :)   
If you need someone to talk to, PM me.  
Navigating being trans is ... difficult. <3

Just had convo with HR. My Manager LIED to me about not being allowed to wear makeup	"When I was hired, after training he told me i can't wear makeup as it's part of the ""dress code""

i agreed as I really needed the job, and suffered a lot of dysphoria from it. A few weeks ago a woman on our team came in wearing full face makeup, so i texted him and said ""I thought we weren't allowed to wear makeup?"" - he didn't even REPLY.

So I called my union, and just had a conversation with HR and my union today. My boss made it up. He lied. There is no policy saying makeup is forbidden, only that makeup needs to be ""conservative""

so wtf. I could've been wearing my makeup THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME??? I see this as pure transphobia. This comes from somebody who couldn't get my pronouns right for over a month when he first hired me. Somebody who has been toxic and wrote me up for refusing to work overtime shifts (which HR also disputed and threw out). 

&#x200B;

I feel happy I can finally wear makeup but I'm just super annoyed this whole time he has been lying to me and disrespecting me. I hope he gets fired. It's to the point where I have had to block my own manager's cell phone because he won't respect my boundaries - he texts me and calls me at early AM hours when I work til midnight and typically don't wake up until mid morning yet he constantly is texting and calling me at 8am multiple times a week."	"Got receipts of your manager denying you? If so, let HR know you’ve got a potential lawsuit.
Don’t block him. 

Get those receipts and take them to HR. If HR doesn’t act, take them to your union. If your union doesn’t act, take them to an employment lawyer.
This should be a easy lawsuit, talk with your union and get a lawyer, I think many lawyers would love a case like this.
It's good that you knew to dish with hr/the union about it. Definitely document everything and keep in mind anything you do could be documented too, so think twice about being sarcastic with you boss. Don't say anything that could get you in trouble especially in writing or email. Cooler heads are the winners if you take this to the union or a court of law.
I hate putting on makeup but I'll admit I'm a lot more confident once I have it on. It's like our armor going into battle. What kind of person would deny us that?
That's textbook discrimination. Document every time he treats you differently from other employees with dates if possible. Save every text.  Do this at any job, even if you don't feel discriminated against. It's important to have a record of mistreatment if you want to build a case for discrimination.
This seems like a pretty clear violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as per the Bostock v. Clayton County SCOTUS case that ruled that discrimination on the basis of gender (including gender identity) falls under its prohibitions of ""sex discrimination"" in employment
Talk to your union to see if they can't take action against the company and/or your manager
And yes absolutely evil and it sucks.

But, girl, you just struck a blow for all the trans folk coming up next.

Be proud of yourself!
Wows… 

Idk what to say,.. 
in spite lol.. wear makeup to the court if/when you get a court date
Sounds about right. I had a boss who referred to me (trans dude) as “it” rather than the he/him I asked for, and my gf at the time (trans woman) as “he” constantly.
Document all of this and everything going forward because that's discrimination.
Sue them into the ground sister, all the love to you!
Put your phone on do not disturb. The phone won’t ring, but you can see the notifications when you wake up.
Number of commenters here confusing ""at will"" with ""right to work"" is...😖

Very different legal doctrines.
Yeah that sounds like harassment and a law suit waiting to happen.
Did he hire you??? I mean, why would they be so toxic AND hire you? You have advocates some place in that company. ""F"" that guy for being such an AH!! Good for you and your union and your HR.
That sucks:(:( what a control freak.... I never get why people even care 🙄.. I'm sure he lives by a long list of arbitrary standards 😆
Lawsuit time!
Glad you called out the hypocrisy! Extra glad you have a union that’s standing up for you. 

I went down a similar road with my very powerful union. It was years of stress and though I did win, the settlement was absolute peanuts compared to the effort I put in, but the union was very proud to have won a grievance and they said it would help protect other members in the future.

Sending you strength!
Since disphoria is a very clear mental health issue I could think of an argument in the direction of ableism. I mean he literally made you suffer more and basically denied you a pretty easy fix, that random other people use too. He caused suffering and he did it intentionally - that's so disgusting.
Mothrr fucker I can believe he did that to you
[removed]
Yes.
Don’t talk to HR, talk to your union rep.
See this is what baffles me.

Hate and bigotry aside, it's just terrible business to be transphobic. Why bother?
Blocking just puts his messages in a special folder and muted alerts.
NOO!!! If you have a Union, NEVER go to HR first!!! NEVER!!
This! Agree, unblock and document the shit out of all of it, download your phone bills to get dates and times and go to your union rep, there has to be something in company policy.  If not just stay calm until he power trips and document it
Never go to HR first.

If you don't live in an ""at will"" state, always go to your union first.

HR's main objective is not to help you to be treated right. Their main objective is to protect the company from lawsuits. If HR determines that it would be easier to fire you for a bogus reason than deal with your complaints, they just might do it.
Personal lawyer (if affordable) then Union then HR

Avoid corruption opportunities as much as possible, HR is just the “manage the serfs” division of any company and unfortunately a lot of modern unions are just an extension of corporate BS (shout out to the IWW keeping it real)
Union FIRST! HR is there to protect Corporate, Unions by law, are there to protect employees!
Chilllllll
Don't talk to HR about a lawsuit until you've met with a lawyer first.
It’s time to call Saul
Where is this folder located?
Yeah, don't block his number, but do put your phone on do not disturb while you're asleep, then you also have evidence of his constant harrassment outside of work and at unacceptable hours.
NO, NO NO!!! UNION first! If they think you need a lawyer, they’ll hire one for you!!
yeah i strogly disagree... corporations wouldnt fight unionization as much as they do if they were just ""extensions of corporate bs"", and they have done wonders for workers rights. Unions being ""corrupt"" is a classic conservative talking point cause of the italian mob in the 80's. If i was in this situation i wouldnt really truly trust any side and id probably get my own lawyer before i went to either side, but id definitely still get the union involved
I am aware HR is there to protect the company - and supervisor is likely breaking company policy and may be breaking local laws. Disciplining him does not necessarily have to do strictly with protecting OP but with protecting the company. 

I had one supervisor try to pull a fast one on me when I was early in transition but in violation of municipal laws, so HR moved fast to cover their ass.
102 
On the periodic table
I'm not talking to HR without my union present
Yeah HR 's ONLY FRIEND is the employer.
Transphobic douchebag boss? BETTER CALL SAUL!
...on my phone...
I’ve just had friends fucked by their union before when bringing up legal concerns so I’m hesitant to trust any hierarchical organization
Depends on the union. Some are shit
A union is still far better than no union, pretty much across the board. But unions today are very different and far less effective than they were in the early 1900s when major concessions were won. Striking made illegal, stuff like that. You do see some modern victories with teachers going on strike in the last like five years or some thing, then the thing with the rail workers in the last year (although it didn’t seem to actually get all the concessions necessary to prevent a bunch of people dying from preventable safety concerns)

I’m strongly in favor of solidarity unionism not hierarchical structures that reproduce the bureaucracy inherent to capitalism and the state. I hope I don’t come off as anti-union here, rather I think the unions that exist need to engage in far more radical & direct action in order to further workers rights and put an end to capitalism. I’ve had too many people completely balk at the idea of unionism because their experience of modern unions was regimented bureaucracy where their union reps wouldn’t even fight against literal criminal acts done by the corporation.

Need better unions not no unions.

https://www.iww.org/preamble/
Good. Consider talking to a lawyer for yourself as well. But the union is much better than nothing.
that is 100% the best practice.

HR isn't there to help you. They'll hang you out to dry if it's easier for them. Their #1 concern is to protect the company from lawsuits.

Always go to your union first (thank the gods you don't live in an ""at will"" state oof).
This is the way
Please do keep us up to date too!! Both individuals and companies NEED to learn this kind of hate just isn't acceptable.  Hope things work out in the best possible way for you <3
Sweet, how do I access it?
Wow, gotta love America... 😒
True. BUT unions are among the most democratic social structures we have! With a union, you can run for office, negotiate rules and contracts for workers, support political candidates. HR is there to protect the CORPORATION, not employees!
YES!!! Talk to your Union FIRST!! NOT an independent lawyer. Your union has access to union attorneys, or will hire one for you! Lawyers are rarely the union’s first response, for good reason! And READ your union’s contract! It will give you lots of information about your specific rights! Good luck!
gettin a little creepy i see
Jeesh guys, is it really not obvious I’m asking about how to access the folder on my phone?
Wtf
Lmao wtf
[deleted]
Op was being a smart ass by telling me it was on their phone; no one would ask about accessing someone else’s phone, I was talking about where is the folder on peoples phones in general…

I mean I’m somewhat autistic, but people here are on another plane of existence altogether—like what kind of people think such gutter thoughts in this type of conversation and think I’m wondering about anything but my own phone? Blows my mind, truly
before i read that you were autistic i was thinking your whole thread is what it feels like to be autistic and have people misunderstand you all the damn time lmao. 

anyway, on my phone the spam folder is inside the text messaging app. i'm sure every phone is different but you go into the menu (usually three horizontal lines) and one of the options is spam and blocked. hope this helped :)

I’m so fucking terrified	"I’m American. I’m transgender. I’m 15 years old. 

Please, please, just let me grow up. I’m not a terrorist. I’m not a pedophile. I’m not a freak. I’m not insane. I’m not psychopathic. I’m a kid. I’m a kid. I want to live somewhere where I can feel safe and happy. 

I’m a kid. And I’m terrified to go outside. I’m terrified to get older. I’m terrified to live. 

Please, just let me live."	"It’s scary but we’re all here for you, and plenty of people are working to change the world. There’s always major pushback before real change happens, the current powers are desperate for control and tightening their grip but we’ll never go away ;)
I promise you, the future is not as bleak as It seems.

Conservatives lost the war on blacks.

Conservatives lost the war on women.

Conservatives lost the war on gays.

They will lose the war on trans people too.

Historically speaking, legislatures tend to be more populist and reactionary than the judiciary. There is ample historical precedent for the judiciary to strike down unconstitutional and heinous laws designed to oppress an entire class of innocent people.

Conservatives know they are losing political power. The hundreds of anti-transgender laws are not a sign of their growing power, but a sign of their desperation.

Conservatives are literally trying to flood the legislature with all of these bills to 1) rally the base, 2) suck up time and political energy that could have been used to fight for fair wages, prohibit superlandlords from buying up single-family residential homes, fund public schools, and much more.

In the grand scheme of things, conservatives delay tactic will not work. Their heinous laws will be struck down, they will be voted out of office, and society will progress in spite of conservatives throwing a temper tantrum and stamping their feet.

Please do not lose hope. Fascists always lose.
Hang in there, okay?  It does get better.  Or at the very least, as you get older, you’ll have more resources (both social, economic, and psychological) to help you cope.
Dad of a trans daughter here. You ARE valid and you DO matter!  People who you don’t even know are fighting for you and your future.  Please know that. Everyday.
Things are really scary, I won't lie. But this hate isn't popular. Even among the GOP. They want to use us as a scapegoat, but this too shall pass. We're more normalized by society than gay people were in the 80's. We're out in the open. Hopefully, these bans will be challanged and reversed. And when the people pushing then try to push (AGAIN) om anti-trans beliefs, it'll be pushed back with (again). I have hope that things will be better.

Trans people are resilient, we've been around for as long as there have been words or people. We won't dissapear. Things are tough right now. 

There's an anecdote about a wise man. In good times he would say, ""remember, this shall pass"" and in bad times to comfort he would say ""this too, shall pass."" Nothing lasts forever. If we make it through the tough times, we'll live to see better days. In all things, this too shall pass.
Its so stupid that they justify hating and killing us with ""cause the fancy book says so"" 

Or calling us pedos despite the church being full of them
In that regard its hypocrisy 

It will get to the point where we will have enough and leave the country

Im a transfem from the UK and things arnt as serious here
Not, risk of life bad, more risk of loosing trans care and occasional bullying.


Lastly
I find it so stupid that we teach children to love and be kind but those adults in charge are anything but.
Dude I feel you. I live in Texas and just turned 16 last month. The feeling of being afraid to be who I am is awful. Can't legally get onto hormones until I'm 18 here. Thankfully I'll be moving to Illinois soon, so it'll just be a test to see if I'm able to ask my parents or not. I know you can get through it, man!
20 years LGBT people were facing similar attacks and we had much less allies than we do now. Today the situation is different, and it is dangerous, but there is hope with time. I know that doesn't mean much in terms of what to do right now, which is scary, but you are definitely not alone.
I promise it gets better. The world seems scary and some people are awful but there are a lot of good people out there, too! Most people I’ve met are really kind, even the ones who don’t support transness in general. And you generally don’t have to interact with anyone you don’t want to as an adult- it’s the best.

You know who you are 💕🌈

Sending hugs
Fuck, this is heartbreaking. 

Look I'm only a decade older than you but what I've learned so far is that conservative politicians in our country need a boogeyman to fearmonger about. Right now, it happens to be us but it won't be forever. We'll get through this and be ready to help defend the next group they decide to target.

Three more years (or less) and you'll be able to get where you need to go and do what you need to do feel more comfortable. You'll have a community to come home to no matter what bullshit is happening politically. We aren't going anywhere, just remember that. ❤️
Trust me kid. You get used to it. Find some close people and don’t use Twitter or tik tok. Most people are nice and the ones you see online, are just the hateful miniority
Oh kid,  I'm worried about you! You should show the post to those closest to you. It's so well said, and so on point, every adult who cares for you should read this
This is temporary
You aren't a freak, you're a person. Take it from someone who figured out they were trans younger than you but repressed it until my mid-20's: you're not going to stop being who you are, and the people who hate you for it are the evil ones.

I spent too much time hating myself for what other people thought. Find better people.
Dad of a trans 16 year old. You're loved. People think you're awesome. They admire your courage. Stay strong!
15. God, I remember how it felt in 2004. I wasn't out, being anything less than straight was bullied in my school, and even existing everyday felt like a knife was gutting me from the inside. You need to know that the reverberations coming off of social media and regular news don't mean shit. There are a bunch of hateful old (and unfortunately younger) people who are rooting against us all. Even at 33, (which probably seems like a lifetime away for you), I still find myself feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and honestly scared of what's going on in the country right now. You absolutely aren't alone. We're asking for the simplest of things. Not too much, not too hard, yet there are these new and seemingly impossible hurdles that we're being demonized over. Please please please don't listen to anyone, on any post, regarding trans or gender non conforming folx as pedophiles, groomers, etc etc etc. It might seem bleak at the moment, especially depending on the state you're in, but it's not over yet. If you see someone saying something hateful towards you or anyone around you that you support, it's because it's the newest tactic to shut you down. The hateful words they're using aren't new, in fact, they're recycling old slurs from the 70s. I know it's hard right now, especially with everything going on, but if I could advise you on something I never did as a teen, it would be to take some time for yourself. Away from social media, away from every other pressure you feel. Just to exist, as yourself, walking along somewhere in nature maybe. Listen to a lana del rey album (that always helps me calm down 😅) Whatever and wherever brings you peace. I know you feel helpless, but there are TONS of older folx fighting for you. Sorry it was a total TL;DR, but I hope this helps you feel more safe than you've been feeling.
Everyday I'm hating and wanting to leave this country
Don't worry, you're not alone in this fear. Im 18, only three years older, and I'm terrified. But I'm sure if we keep our heads up and don't back down, things will be okay. We won't let them win.
I wish you the best of luck, we are in this together and your never alone in this. I shall lend you my shoulder to lean on for support, and my ears to listen to you about any problems you have or want to talk about. This is unfortunately the best I can do for you though. But I just want to let you know that looking past the bleakness and see a bright light is worth more than all what people will say, have a healthy positive outlook and things will hopefully work out. Good luck and please do well in your life.
Me too. I live in TN.. The legislation and the shooting recently both made me terrified to be trans. Leaving the house makes me scared. It shouldn't come to this.
Elder trans here (still baby in that I transitioned recently) things do get better, and you WILL become your true self.  I started at 30, there is time, dont wait to become yourself top long, but you WILL get there. And I too just want to be able to grow old as my real self. We are here for you
I'm so so sorry you are scared and this is happening.  People do care, I care.  My daughter is trans, and I see what she is going through and it's breaking my heart.  You do matter,  and rational people know that, I know it.

I know it looks bleak and terrifying right now.  There are a lot of people that are fighting it.  But I can't stress enough to stay safe.

Many hugs and lots of 💗
Here's a link to rainbow refugee society who help LGBT people to claim asylum in Canada

I never thought that this post would get so much positive attention. Thank you to everyone for your kind words and encouragement, you are all... so, so amazing, it's honestly made me cry a few times how nice people are being to me. 

I'm still terrified, of course, but less so now, because I know how many other people like me are out there. 

We'll get through this together. Every one of you is an invaluable and precious human being. Thank you all.
They are losing and this seems to be a losing issue for the right. That's what my roomie who is more politically inclined is saying. We got this just keep your chin up ok :)
America is becoming more and more extreme and fascist. I’m so sorry you are apart of this. I’m especially sorry you’re a minor and can’t really even leave this mess. You will get through this. We need to fight for ourselves even if we are tired.
We just want to live is that so much to ask just leave us alone and let us live our lives
I feel you. Right now it feels like things are insurmountable. Just know that a lot of people have your back and it will get better.
Good to wrote about
Sending you lots of love and strength. 🩷💪🏳️‍⚧️
Hey hun, I’m 17 and under the trans umbrella (genderfluid w/o identifying as female). We gotta keep fighting okay? We got this, keep your head up. My dms are always open if you need a break <3
Sending you lots of love little brother OP. Glad to have you on this Earth and in this thread
jesus, this is exactly how i feel. with all the shit happening here, it's just not a safe place for us anymore, and i don't think it was to begin with. that's why i'm moving to ireland or canada when i can.
I'm so sorry that you're frightened. I'm furious that you have every reason to be. The RW politicians in this country have decided you're the focus of everything evil without a shred of evidence. Their evil will come back to bite them, but hopefully without too much damage to innocents like you.
i’m so sorry you have to worry about this right now. there are thousands of people fighting for you though ❣️
I’m rooting for you friend. You are important, your life has value. Please don’t let fear of the haters stop you from living your life. Take care of yourself. I know it’s scary, but it’s going to be alright.
There are many millions more people who want this awfulness to stop, but it's not as newsworthy/click-friendly as politically-charged scare headlines that make everyone upset.  The people that shout about it the most are really just signaling their fear and ignorance.

This moral panic crap goes a long way back in history, and it always turns.  The 'red scare' in the 1950s ended when Joseph McCarthy's own allies turned on him in disgust.

The hate for 'hippies' in the 1960s ended when Kent State happened and enough people in the US said, ""They're just kids.  This has gone too far.""

It will turn.  Look to the people around you who care about you and know that people here support you too.
Oh honey. The world is a scary and terrifying place sometimes. Know that there are good people and people who love you for being you. Never forget that. 🤗
this is fucking me. fuck i am terrified. i live in florida. and can’t get out for a year.
I'm twelve and trans
People are using the recent incident to hate me
They believe they’re the silent majority… I can tell you they are not. Whether or not some %age of people are indifferent - there are more supporters out there than there are Nazi conservatives trying to take everyone’s rights away. 

They’re the ones who should be terrified. 

They’re the ones whose worldview is ancient and based in intolerance. 

They’re a dying breed of old white people and stupid religious POS. 

I’d be scared to live some places - but there’s always moving up here to MA… Sure not everyone is on board but it’s a safe place.
I'm your big trans sister. The lady with a reputation for teaching the gays how to shoot. Nothing is ever going to happen to you
I know momma. I know. You’ve got support in places you may not think you do. Keep your head up & on a swivel. One of the comments said it as i was scrolling. 

Fascists always lose.
Listen, we are fighting for you. We will do everything we can to make sure you can grow up. You are just a person, and I promise you we will fight for you. We are fighting for YOU. Hang in there.
It may not help the anxiety, but there is hope for democracy and safety in America. Seeing the recent protests and success in Israel and Georgia (the country, not the state) against gov’t attempts to consolidate power there is hope. Hope, volume and being on the side of what’s right will win the day against would-be fascist dictators. There is a lot of rot in the institutions, but there is also a lot of good. We have strength in community and will continue to bring light to injustice. Allies will come. We are not the minority. Don’t let the loud voices screaming from the back of the theatre become the main attraction. They are the margins and represent the muck of our society. Trumpism has just stirred that muck up. It will clear in due time. The biggest danger is taking our eyes off the true threat to democracy and that is in the systematic attacks on the underpinnings of the country. Republicans want to tear it all down. Don’t allow them yelling “fire” distract from their real goals.
My sweet young friend, we will survive this as we always have. Stay strong, stay yourself until unsafe. We will make it.
There was a TikTok I saw not too long ago from a fat activist talking about how the reason fatphobia is so loud and intense lately is because fatphobes know they're losing the battle. The world is becoming more accepting, more open, more willing, and the people who have nothing to live for other than the sense of self-righteousness they get from hating others are screeching for the last breath of their bigoted beliefs. 

I believe something similar is ultimately happening with transphobia. There's always going to be bigots, and they're always going to try to make things worse, but most people aren't bigots. Maybe uneducated, maybe raised to believe a certain way, but not violent and not calling for extermination. You'll understand this more as you get older, but most people want to quietly live their lives, unbothered and without bothering others. 

And something you can work to understand now is that everything is in a fluid state of impermanence. Fear will pass. Pain will pass. Nothing lasts forever, no feeling, no experience. Things will change.
🫡 I’ll stand on the street corner so they stare and go at me first

Everything is fucked right now. Everything is so scary.
Also fellow kid (16) i would also like to grow up without fearing for my life and be able to happily go on t and have rights :/
Dude I'm also a trans kid in America currently and absolutely terrified... What are we even supposed to do at this point :(
Hi friend, I know how you feel, I’m in the same boat as you sometimes.  Whatever you do I want you to just keep living.  I know it’s hard and I know you’re scared but please know you’re not alone, and you are loved.  If you feel like you’re going to s/h or worse, please please please reach out to a helpline, a therapist, even family and friends.  I know coming from a stranger on the internet this might not seem like much but I have to try my best to help.  We love you.
Im like a pin prick away from going scorched earth on the GOP... like I get it, that is what they WANT us to do, but damn if I ever felt like a group deserved to be torn down.
I am 64 and post op. I am just as terrified as you are. My gender dysphoria is kicking my ass. I never expected to feel that again. The world is broken. Pray for guidance and strength. Stay to yourself be invisible. It's all you can do. Trust no one. You are only a kid.
Hey man, I get it. I’m 15 and American. I’m scared too, but we should try to stay hopeful. I think it’ll get better.
Hugs.  See if you can join us somewhere like Seattle when you turn 18, and also get your passport.  You shouldn't have to always be strong, but we are in that world, and we can all help each other remain strong.
Do you want a hug?
Bruv me fr
That broke my heart ! This is America, where our children are supposed to come first,to live their dreams. Whatever their dreams may be. Since when did their dreams come with censorship? And these kids are so brave, they have more heart than any of their adversaries. I want to make it all better for them. Because this is not what America is supposed to be. I don’t know the answer but I believe with all my heart they must be loved and given every opportunity to live their lives to the fullest. I may be saddened, however, I am not broken. I’m not willing to lay down and let them do this. God bless everyone.
This world is still horrible, I’m not gonna deny it. But we’re working for a change, a big and permanent change were we can be happy and live with no fear. You’re not alone. We are strong people.
*hugs*
We got you 💪
Please be brave get in touch with a local helper or helpline, best of luck hang I there
I’m currently transitioning.  I’m 35 years old… so 20 years older than you.

I’m male to female but consider myself a non-binary woman.

Transition is always emotionally painful (yet freeing) but worthwhile.

I’d do anything to go back to being 15 and transition, even if I had to wait until 18.

I’ve known I’m trans since I was 5.  I was born in the 80s.  I knew vaguely of trans people growing up but never met one until I was in my 20s.  

My mind was blown “I never knew I could do that” was what I thought… working as a 23 year old.

You’re wise beyond your years.  I can tell from the post.

I’m older and can access gender affirming care pretty easily in a safe blue state.  Still, the fear is always there to some degree.  You learn to live with it.

You will survive
You will make friends
Found family is family
You will be loved for who you are
Radical love of yourself is enough
You are trans enough
You are valid
No one can take your gender from you

You will not just survive, but thrive.

Do not give up.  It’s what they want from us.  Honestly I was just sobbing on a flight thinking of all that’s going on.  The news, the politics… it’s too much.

There’s also never been more “out” trans people.  We are unstoppable.

I buried my identity for survival to the point it took me until 35 to fully come out….

Do not give up.  This darkness hangs over everything and sometimes I just break down and cry.  Especially for kids like me who had to hide who they were for so long in a world that didn’t understand them.

Today I’m married, I’m sober, I’m happy.  Transition has been hard and continues to be hard….


As many other posters said don’t give up.  We need you in this world.  You belong in this world.
Yeah no intelligent person believes you’re a threat, they’re using trans people as a scapegoat when the market crashes like the British did with refugees
The politicians will find another scapegoat eventually for their failure to address real problems. It’s just our turn in the barrel
That doesn’t matter to transphobes. There’s really no other way to put this and not sound alarmist. But they are coming for you! They are coming for all of us and we can either run and never gain rights or make out stand. Violence WILL NOT be our first response but a reaction to theirs. I will not stand by and have my fellow brothers and sister shot down . I will and hope you will too, fight until the last muscle twitch, last breath, last light leaves your body
My heart aches for you. I’m scared too. I’m scared for all of us. I’m scared for my child. It’s all I can talk about in therapy. It’s not fair. It makes me just want to stay inside and hide.
We are here for you, kiddo. My kid is trans. My husband is non-binary. That’s why I’m here. To learn and to support. Keep yourself safe, work hard on your grades, apply for scholarships, and go to college in a blue state! I’m in a red state but you bet your ass I’m always looking out for any queer kids who might need protection/support. We are out there and we are here for you.
I'm 15 as well, I feel the same way. I just want to live as me.
take it from someone like me, who feels the exact same way, but is 20 and has had a bit more experience in life- this isn't the end. this is going to be a dark moment, and we're going to have to suffer being the scapegoat for some more time, but the future could be bright. 

you'll only get to see the brightness of that future if you stick around, so by that logic, it's best not to give up. hang in there. it'll be alright someday
I'm so sorry you're going through all of this at this age 😔 We are trying to fight for you 💕✊ We will win our safety
im in the exact same situation. im 15 and also terrified if u ever need to talk my dms are open. i wish u good luck and stay safe brother.
There is nothing wrong with you, not one thing. You are a human being, and deserving of all the love and care and freedom in the world. We’re living in tough times right now, I know, it’s terrifying. It’s so easy to give way to fear and pain, especially in times like these. But it will get better. You will see the day when all of this nonsense is done away with for good. You will see these clouds clear. It’s so hard, so so hard, especially at your age, to hold onto hope for the future when it feels like the world is against you. Trust me, I know. But if you just keep going, just one more day, and another, and another, one at a time, eventually you’ll realize that it has gotten better, and you’ve made it so much farther than you thought you would. You may not believe in yourself, but I believe in you. You *can* survive this. You will. The sun will rise again. I promise
I know you're scared, I am too. We just need to hang on throught this scary time. It will get better. And as soon as you turn 18 be sure to VOTE.
You can really tell that the conservatives are ramping up those election “activities”. But I feel like a lot of this anti-trans propaganda will be over soon enough. They just don’t want another catastrophe like the midterms.
Know that your are loved
Just remember it’s ultimately about their hate, their insecurities, their bullshit, and it’s not your problem. 
At the end of the day, a large portion of the hate is because they probably have some kind of repressed gender identity or sexual orientation stuff and they see you as someone they wish they could be.

Conservative religious people and their values and religion are stupid anyway, who gives a shit about what a bunch of goober religious conservatives think anyway?
i understand that completely. i'm a trans 14 year old living in america and it's really scary right now. I believe in us, though. i'm proud of you for having made it as far as you have, and i believe that you can survive and get through this!!
I'm 16 and a trans-American and I feel you. I'm terrified of how our rights will look by the time I'm an adult. I'm considering Canada for college.
Being 15 and trans can be a terrifying prospect. Beleieve in yourself.  That age was a particularly hard time for me. Fortunately for you there are a lot more resources available to you than there were for me 25 years ago. I got past it and am happy to still be here. Use them. And keep giving yourself positive affirmations. Just take out the negativity. Youre ARE sane. You ARE unique. You ARE a beautiful person. Fuck what anyone else thinks, it's what you think of yourself that counts. 
I wish you the best... Things WILL get better... 
Depending on where you live in America, be grateful for it. The US and Canada are much more trans friendly than other places in the  world  💛
I’m in canada, if there is anything I can do to help you come up North let me know.
Take it one day at a time, brother. Focus hard on the building blocks that will give you freedom: your education, earning an income, staying away from bad influences like drugs and staying out of trouble. These are the weapons available to you right now. Fight for your freedom with them. Stay safe. 

You will graduate, you will turn 18, you will look back at yourself and thank yourself for making the right decisions. It will come sooner than you think. Take it one day at a time. 

Try to avoid the news. The news can crush you when there is nothing you can do to stop what is happening. When you turn 18, register to vote. Do it long before any election--do it as soon as possible. You'll be 18 in 2025 or 2026, right? So you should be able to vote in the 2026 midterm. You know how powerful a voting force Gen Z turned out to be in 2022? You can be a part of that in 2026. We will need you, and it will make a difference. 

I promise we are fighting for you. Take care of yourself Tristen. I hope you will stay safe.
We’re going to be okay, it’s terrifying but I promise you it’s going to work out. I’d try to avoid the news for a bit and focus on your mental health
I’m with you, 16 and trans and I could not be more scared for our future. We have to support each other, if the government won’t we will. I plan on moving to a country that’s less risky to go outside and just exist, but for the time being as much as I hate to say it there won’t be much progress for a while. You’ll be ok, just make sure your safe where you are for the time being. We’re here and we won’t stop fighting but it’s gonna take some time
It's bleak right now especially with the dementia ridden president we have in office but there's millions of us and allies ready to fight for your rights no kid deserves this stripping of their identity
OP, just know that if I could, I would find you and give you the biggest hug.
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. I vow to ALWAYS be an ally. Especially when nobody is looking.
Hang in there kid.

Times have actually been worse and hopefully soon, they'll be better.

I remember being your age and being terrified, you actually have it really good compared to people born 20 years before you. Either way, we're a in it together and we all have each other 💕 

I honestly think we're right on the border where people born trans are accepted as normal....maybe 20 years away before we're considered normal boring everyday people. Let's hope....and until then it's nothing but a diet of selfies and supporting each other on r/trans.
I’ll shout from the rooftops until I’m blue in the face that this was never about “protecting kids” these bills are killing them, but they’re not going to win. The blood of our children are on their hands, and I’m not going down without a fight. Stay strong kid, we’re here for you.
I’m not saying your fears are unreasonable and I don’t know exactly what your situation is but these posts that are just freaking out that lead to more freaking out in the comments- I don’t think it’s very healthy for anyone involved.

This is the reality of the situation. A lot of things suck and are bad and I know tensions are high with all of the bills that are appearing and the shooting yesterday but panicking so much about this is not helping you or anyone.

I’m a bit older than you and I’ve had thoughts like this before that have propelled me into a deep depression. You have to remember that that’s exactly what these people that hate us so deeply want. They want us to be depressed and kill ourselves. But you, living your best trans life, giving it your all in despite of everything is the biggest fuck you to transphobes. It’s cheesy but you have to remain optimistic as much as you possibly can, and it breaks my heart because you’re so young and it’s clear you’re already having trouble with that.

Please please hang in there. Find joy anywhere you can. Dms open if you need to talk about anything.
I can relate. This is why I want there to be gun laws that prioritize us above others. Don't get me wrong, the support for us is bigger than you think and still growing exponentially, but things are truly dire right now. Transphobia is like a highly efficient fuel; the small group that blindly hates us has a disproportionate amount of power and too many of their spiteful proposals become oppressive laws. In my opinion mental health checks should be mandatory for everyone in the US trying to buy a firearm except for people who identify as trans, even if just for a few years. This is the endgame. Republicans know it, we know it. But we must win.

so settle down and let your parents/role models or whomever is positive in your life guide you to a place where you can make sound choices on life paths

&#x200B;

lets not forget when you scream to be a kid..well act like  kid!\~!!!

damn thats crazy but i dont remember asking
Statistically speaking trans people are killed at the same rate everyone else is.  I really don’t think living in fear is a good idea.
You need studying German
Fuck anyone that stands in your way. There are so many people out there that Want to help and love you. Find them. Other than that, just try to stay safe and ignore bigots. 

What state are you in?
Don’t forget that conservatives are trying to wage a war against people with disabilities through dismantling the education system.

I sadly know this because I have multiple disabilities (if you are curious about what disabilities I have, you can DM me if you want to talk about my experience with this issue, I’m more than happy to talk about it) and seeing how poorly other states are handling kids who have disabilities and need all the resources and support they can get, but sadly tend not to get access to because of these idiotic Republicans who don’t care to understand what the Americans with Disabilities Act says alongside the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975. These politicians clearly don’t understand how they are taking our country backwards.

Privatization of the education system is a poor idea as these politicians have no plan to improve the system for people who have disabilities who can’t afford private education. This is why the war on public education will ultimately cost conservatives a lot more problems just as much as their war against the transgender community.
This trans hysteria is unique in that transphobia as a scapegoat was picked randomly. We had most of our needed basic trans rights already for years, it’s literally being actively taken away, stripped away lawfully. Transphobia wasn’t as prominent as it was abt 4 years ago, at all. People didn’t have an opinion on trans people, supportive or neutral. This propaganda drive shows the reality of how people are actually brainwashed. Transphobia also worked pretty well in riling people up, brining even libs and conservakunts together. It will get better for sure, but we also need to work together to make that happen
>Conservatives know they are losing political power. The hundreds of anti-transgender laws are not a sign of their growing power, but a sign of their desperation.

Thankyou for saying this. I hadn't thought of it like this and was down about it, I'd imagine a lot of people are the same and need to hear this. It restores faith we are actually progressing as a society and not going drastically backwards as the media seems to indicate
""Conservatives lost the war on women.""

And then they stripped away Roe v. Wade and more than half of the states in this country banned abortion with some now seeking to ban emergency contraception and birth control.
Thanks /u/gamergirlpee69

I really needed this reminder
>Please do not lose hope. Fascists always lose.

I really hope you are right. But they take rights from woman and gays away, already.. 

Sometimes the light at the end of the tunnel is a train. Please stay safe...
This is correct. They know they are losing. They fear it. The way they lunged at yesterday’s news goes to show they are leeches looking for an opportunity. But everyday people aren’t idiots. Out of the 2000 + mass shootings, the average citizen knows trans folk don’t pose a threat
Conservatives are losing conservative voters too. My brother said he refuses to vote for Trump now. Not sure why exactly as there seems to be more than he's letting on. 
He just really doesn't seem to like the hate at all.
Hello. I am around the same age as the op for this post and i would just like to say that i have been very very anxious right now. Things are very very very scary and i am still a kid. However, you have brought such peace to my heart that i have not felt for a long long time that i am currently crying while writing this. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your words. I love you. Be safe friend.
Everyone knows conservatives constantly fuck up our system making things worse over and over again and yet they're still allowed to try to push their shitty ""policies"" through again and again. Nothing is gonna change unless they're stopped for good but obviously that won't happen.
This feels like cope but I still don’t wanna deal with things getting even worse than this before they get better. All it’s gonna do it leave us with even more traumatized trans people assuming we’re not all dead.
They will only lose the war if we actually fight them as hard as we can. The Weimer republic was one of the most progressive states in Europe before the nazis rose to power. One of the first gender affirming surgeries happened in Berlin. Enough of the public voted for the nazis for them to get into power anyway

Saying that we won the fight before the fight has actually ended is dangerously complacent. Never take progress as a given thing which happens over time. Rights are a social contract that many people have died, protested for and fought for before they were enacted. We must always remember how easy it is for those rights to be revoked at any time. 

If you told somone 8 years ago that january 6th would happen?, That roe vs wade would be repealed and that drag bans would happen. I bet they would be surprised.
Oh buddy you are so out of touch

Quit using the word Fascist.  It doesn't mean what you think it means.
Conservatives always win!!
Thank you
As someone whose dad would never say something like that to me, that means so much. thank you, your daughter is lucky to have you.
can you be my father please
Damn I wish my dad had this attitude!
What's funny is *the book doesn't even fucking say so.*  There's no ""men lying with men is an abomination"" wrt trans people.
I don't hate you and I don't wish you were dead. 

I hope you can live a full and happy life :)
Yes. I'm 25 and your post almost has me in tears. I love you, kid. I love every trans kid growing up in this mess. It wasn't so long ago that it was me. I wanna give you a big protective hug and tell you it'll all be okay. You'll be okay. Just hang in there, okay? Don't keep living for me, or for anyone else, but for yourself. You deserve a happy life. And you'll get it, dude. For now I agree with other commenters and stay off negative social media and news sources. I love you. You got this!
Boogeymen are good distractions from real issues like failed health structure, pitiful social infrastructure, economic inequality, etc. Politicians pointing the finger of deflection.
I'm definitely trying to use Twitter less haha
I hope so
Thank you <3 your kid is lucky to have you
Thank you so much <3
Unfortunately it may not be much better other places, but at least in other places depending, it's not such a national conversation so it might be easier to get by.
Come to California
Thank you  so much <3
We’re always here for you OP ❤️
Wishing you luck, hopefully you find happiness there (: anywhere is better than here haha
Thank you so much <3
Where do you want to go?
You’re missing a very important “period”, after the word ‘trans’, & before the word ‘people’.

I’m not trying to be insensitive to you, in any way. It just makes it read like “trans people are hating me”.

It’s very scary for us right now. I’m so sorry. No 12 year old should be made to feel such things, just for existing.

You are loved. You are valid. You are not alone. We will get through this, together. Stay safe & stay strong, baby. 

Big hugs, for you. 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗

Thank you <3
Let me also add: the VA may not be paying disability to veterans that need it anymore. Believe me, you have more support than you may think. (And the military is more open minded than you may think) 

I swear to you. The Nazi’s are fucking in over their heads this time.
We just have to beat it back under the rock, where it belongs, & weather the storm.

Trans people exist. Always have. That’s not going to change. Society will eventually come to terms with it.

We are here. We are the future. We are inevitable.
I hope so. Thank you <3
We hang in there and keep on living.  It’s incredibly hard right now but that just means it’s even more important.  We’ll get through this.  If you need help please please please reach out to someone.  You are loved, and the community is here ❤️
[removed]
There's nothing I want more haha
Thank you. Thank you so much for sharing your story. It really means a lot. I'm so happy for you that you're doing so well now (:
Thank you so much <3 this means a lot to me.
IMO I think that everyone who gets a gun should have to have a mental screening first, no matter if we're trans or not. I don't think that laws should prioritize anyone; I think we should all just be able to coexist equally without some psycho running rampant and shooting kids while simultaneously giving groups new reasons to hate us
Funny thing. I've never once in my life been offered them, and I know damn well that it's legal with parental consent where I live. No one is randomly handing out puberty blockers or hormones. Do you have any idea how long and painstaking of a process that is? It's honestly inhumane when you think about it, especially for people who are 16+
Not sure how to respond to this except to ask you to please do your research on how many trans people are murdered every year, how many trans people are attacked every day, how often we are verbally harassed and called horrible things and told that we are terrorists. And that doesn't even count the amount of suicides that happen due to all of the constant hatred, both external and internal. 

That person was fucked up. But not because they were trans, because they were, plan and simple, *fucked up.* And their awful decision - I wish there was a stronger word to describe it, but I literally cannot put it into words how terrible it is - put all trans Americans in jeopardy.

So, yes. My life is in danger. My life is in danger every day. And I am terrified to live it.
That's so helpful thank you (this is sarcasm)
The girl, Brianna Ghey that was stabbed to death for being trans was 15.
People will try use this to fuel hate against trans people. Fuck off. We have every right to be scared.

Bro, if you don't get off this sub
what did you mean by this
No, they aren’t. That’s why we go through what we go through, & face down such discrimination & hostility, to be true to ourselves.

It’s so far from “a trend”, that to say otherwise is laughable, & the height of ignorance.
You really didn't have to leave this comment

I'm actually taking it as a language next year. Is Germany a safe country?
Georgia, unfortunately
true
I remember those days and I don't even know how we got here tbh. It's absolutely insane.
>""Conservatives lost the war on women.""And then they stripped away Roe v. Wade and more than half of the states in this country banned abortion with some now seeking to ban emergency contraception and birth control.

And then they lost the midterms because a large majority of Americans support roe v. wade, as do a large majority of Americans support Trans Rights.
And it's already fallen so flat. Over on r/conservative the whole response has basically been a collective ""Seeeeeeeeee it's not JUST straight white guys now will they stop PICKING on us???""
I said Conservatives, not Republicans.

Conservatives used to call themselves Democrats. Now they call themselves Republicans.

Conservatives have always opposed racial equality, women's rights, LGBT rights.
Not sure where you live but I've been volunteering with a pretty cool summer camp for trans kids! Called Camp Lilac. https://www.camplilac.org/  They heavily subsidize the fees for people who can't afford it so worth looking into! It's in Ohio but kids fly from all over the country to be there.

I hope you can find some community wherever you are! ❤️
Virtual - sure.  You can do it kiddo!  

We've already got two of my daughter's friends living with us as they didn't have a place to go.  I'm willing to support people as best I can.

Sending a virtual dad hug and lots of bad dad jokes....
Same goes for you!
Even that is a mistranslation (apparently). The Bible says nothing about being LGBTQ, and somehow being homophobic and transphobic goes hand in hand with being Christian.
And the world is lucky to have you - remember that! No matter how hard it gets.
No problem. I really wish the best for you and want nothing less. I can't possibly grasp how hard it must be for you with things like social media existing and every sort of news story/opinion being thrown in your face whether by phone or your classmates but I swear to you it absolutely gets better. I'm not referring to the politics and whether or not creepy old white dudes control the government. Unfortunately, that doesn't change 😂 but living in general as you are, authentically, does become easier with time. I feel for you on such a deep level that you have to even hear half the things people are slandering us with. It's absolutely unacceptable.
Me and my wifey have been thinking about moving to Illinois at least if anything Canada
somewhere like colorado, and once i can i am getting the fuck out of this countru
OHHH

Thank you, I thought I did put a comma. Thank you sm for correcting me <3
Wdym
I use the GOP in the sense of its entire organization, I intentionally held back from saying republicans. Wanting for the destruction of a system is not the want to eradicate all those assocaited with it.

On that note any one who sits back and lets these things happen, yeah go fuck yourself, I have no kindess for those people.
Virtual hugs.
*gives hug*
Thank you!

There will be good days and bad.  Hold on tight.  Transition is a lifelong process really with many ups and downs.

Try to ignore the hate.  Some healthy distancing from social media sometimes doesn’t hurt.

You’ll be okay.  I wish I had your level of self-awareness about being trans at your age.

It’s cliche but it does get better.

Eventually you just get through enough shit in life that you know you’ll survive.  Just be safe and be yourself.

I really weep for what’s happening in this country and how trans youth must feel.

You win by retaining your identity and will to survive.

You’ve got this.

❤️
I mean it if the kindest possible way: don’t be afraid. 

If you take your own advice and look at numbers, you’ll see you are way less likely to be murdered than your average cis black man, your average cis latino man and even the average cis white man. In the whole of 2020 (at that point “the most violent year”) the TOTAL number of trans and gender non-conforming people victims of deadly violence was… **44**. That’s in the same ballpark as lightning strikes. And most of those 44 deaths are actually not because of transphobia: most are either common crime or intimate partner violence. I’m not saying that you don’t face disproportional discrimination or your life is easy, I feel your struggle. I’m just saying, don’t go around scared some random person is going to kill you because you’re trans. It doesn’t happen. Live your life. You’re going to be fine.
Bro you wrote this like slam poetry lol
Probably that they don't want kids medically transitioning. I won't be doing so until I turn 18 at the earliest, and I do mostly agree that kids shouldn't be able to medically transition before they're at least 16, but honestly, all situations are different, and some people need it to keep living. 

Please don't speak on things you don't understand.
sometimes  written words are left open for the reader to form their own conclusions

simply that
Pretty safe as per what I know
Damn that must be tough in some ways. I’ve heard certain cities are good though?
Propaganda. And the fact that transphobia was almost collectively agreed upon by everyone to be ‘the scapegoat’. That includes MANY people, organized or even orchestrated to keep this going. Including dems, repubs, conservatives, gays/lesbians/trans people (yes), leftists, corporations, etc. it’s extreme cus of how sudden it was. Suddenly it’s all over the internet. Shits pathetic
We're gonna need a bigger majority.
[removed]
I’m so envious of trans camp. That’s so awesome.
wait what?? you are also taking care of other people like your daughter? thats so cool, it restores a bit of my faith in this world that there are people like you. Your daughter must love you a lot and rightfully so!
The bible is rife with absolutely awful stories and it's a shame that ""christians"" choose to bypass the stories of rape, incest, bringing on a ""concubine"" to produce a child which entirely goes against the concept of marriage to them, yet they still cherry pick to find some absolutely irrelevant verse to somehow define us. I'm not religious, just was brought up in the whole mess🙄
You bet.

Much love 💕
That's like trying to say the German Werhmacht weren't as evil as the SS.   


Different colors, same uniform.   


All the same enemy.
is that last sentence directed at me or them i can’t tell
I don't have a Twitter but decided to do a little public digging recently just for personal research, not realizing that the platform is now just a wasteland of bigotry since musk took over. I can't believe half the shit I saw. You have an entire circus that you mentioned; obviously conservatives and far right radicals, but much more dangerous is the ""LGB without the T"" movement, Gays against Groomers (I'm sure I'm late to that party), and straight up passing trans women who have been fortunate enough to be able to pay for transitioning in various ways yet absolutely shit shame people who can't, all while inadvertently betraying their brothers and sisters to suck on the republican teet. I was blindsided tbh.
The beauty of conservatives is that they're a self solving problem.   


Usually they keep on digging until they're 6 ft under, then their opinions don't matter and nobody ever remembers them.   


It's a waiting game TBH and none of those people are getting any younger.
The left wants to raise everyone's wages and give kids free school lunches.

The right wants to legalize child labor, ban black history, overthrow American democracy, and eradicate transgender people.

Both sides are not the same.
Yeah - some of her friends moved out east from AZ and TX and the place they rented had no heat and the carbon monoxide alarm kept going off (this was in Jan last year) so we took them in.  They're full time in college now but live with us even though our daughter is off at college.  We're happy to do it.
Sorry, I can see how it's unclear - definitely directed at them
Yeah the LGB drop the T is literally riding the trans hate train, hoping it would finally lead to ending homophobia from right wing. And it’s actually working, conservatives are accepting homosexuals now if they appear against trans people. But it still further increases transphobia. That’s why I wish the trans community would just ignore them, fighting back is what they want. Us being outraged and divided is what they want, they’re using us and we’re taking the bait. Please PLS ignore lgb drop the t /gays against groomers, pls. But other rightoids yeah f them lmfao keep trolling, fkcing with them, they’re horrible miserable POSs and never let it get to you, ever. I understand but pls don’t have high expectations that LGBT won’t be transphobic, they will. With this trans hysteria lgbts proces they’re willing to betray us. The best thing to do is literally ignore these LGB drop the T, their community doesn’t even have a base. All they do is portray transphobic shit, and get right wing approval. Like they’re not even centered around said Lesbians, gays or bisexuals. And Gays against groomers is so vague and pathetic that they’re fighting the narrative of wanting to be included as ‘groomers’ and it’s only us bad trans people, yes it’s that fkcing pathetic lmfao. Even tho I’m reality, they’re literally calling gay people groomers/pedos as well. I’m in my first year hrt but still not fully out publicly cus of my family, and live as a gay guy barely, and lemme tell you, homophobia is alive and strong, I think worse than transphobia, cus my trans friends who started passing barely reveal they’re trans cus they don’t need to, but being out with my ex bf always resulted in a bigoted encounter around the corner. So let them fight air, reality will get them.
They're an active threat *now*. Waiting them out isn't going to do any good if we're all in camps.
I legit one day a few weeks ago was like, ""well, let's just see what Twitter is like these days"". Don't know why, and like I said I don't have an account, more like I've been inspecting the scope from my browser. Even so, it's been a wild ride. I definitely noticed what you said about the lgb/t movement stepping away from issues entirely. That entire movement is nuts. Like I'm sorry but gay men don't give a fuck about lesbians, just like lesbians don't give a fuck about bi people, so on and so forth. But for there to be some call to separate the entirety of the community is batshit. I can't say I'm surprised but like they like to say we ""hijacked"" the lgb, the lgb, and also t have been hijacked by a bunch of scumbags that want nothing more than to appease a horrible lot of political asshats for the clout. Gays against groomers is a whole other story lmfao I don't even know what the message is there other than stupidity. And that org is STRICTLY clout that panders to conservatives that like you said will vouch for gay people as long as they're trashing trans folx, conservative gay men, and ""I was trans once but now I'm not so my bad judgement should fall on an entire group of people who actually want to transition"" celebrities of late. And I'm sorry but the founder of gag totally gets the society pass because she's femme, so why would she have to worry about being called a groomer in the first place? It's all for good reason, and definitely with a very obvious purpose and it's just mind numbing how these pages, orgs, ""movements"", whatever, even exist. Not entirely surprised, like I said, I'm sure I'm late to the party. Have I thought about reactivating my Twitter account just to engage in conversation? Absolutely. But I can't and won't. It'd be a waste of time.
I blame Abigail Shrier, author of ""Irreversible Damage."" That book did incredible harm.
The only one doing irreversible damage here is her, ironically enough.

(her work has singlehandedly ruined discourse regarding transmasculine people, or at least the little discourse that there is)"	124phlz	trans	1977	0.93	2023-03-28 13:53:30

Feeling happy at 41 years and 10 months of HRT 💜🤍💙		"41?!? You look in your 20’s!! Wow! You are absolutely gorgeous and I’m so glad you’re happy!
41!??? You look 18 shut up:)
41??? Girl you are aging backwards
Such a cute picture!
You look so young, HRT is amazing
I'm about 4 months behind you in both age and time on HRT. And you look amazing!!!
[deleted]
Wow, your so pretty!
Looking stunning!
Do you mean you are 41 and it's been 10months with her? Or it's been 41 years and 10 months with hrt?
you look amazing for 41, you genuinely look mid 20s at most
Wait I thought after ten years of hormones your body starts to produce the one you want and you don’t have to keep taking them am I wrong?
Thank you so much for posting. I mostly see young people on here, and then I wonder if I started too late.

Seeing this makes me feel like I can be pretty too.
Beautiful
Gorgeous ❤️
Note to self: estrogen = 20 years younger.
21?
It’s okay the 2 and the 4 are pretty close together on the keyboard 😘

You look great sweetheart, go you! 😍
How long did you go without hrt?
I swear we age backwards on HRT.  You could pass for over a decade younger!
41???!!! Excuse me but either you found the best anti ageing cream or you’re an Immortal Vampire or smth!
NO WAI UR 41!
Absolutely adorable
Stunning 🤩
If you didn’t say in your title, I wouldn’t have believed that you were 41. You look at least 18.
You're 41????!! HOW???
Shiiiiiiiit you are like the definition of forever 21
Legit wouldn't have guessed you were trans if I hadn't seen the sub name, you look more feminine than me! (and I'm a cis girl)
You're super pretty :)
you go girl like the other comment's say you look AMAZING for your age.
Always great feeling happy <3
i'm gonna need you to drop your skincare routine right now
what does HRT mean?
41?? Ma'am, your aging backwards-
You look fabulous, Darling!
You are so cute!
Happiness suits you, be well friend!
HELL YE!
There's no way you're 41. I would have guessed mid-late 20s haha
You dont look a day under 55
And you look georgeous
Damn you look like your in your late 20s your hot af!!!!
Lovely 😊
EEEEE you look so gorgeous!!!
Hun, you look like an absolute queen, keep that beautiful smile!!!!
Well if your ever in canada look me up and I will take you for dinner
You look great ♥ Thankyou for sharing your progress. 

Your posts inspired this 37 y/old to finally great her first trans reddit account. And, hey, to refer to herself with that pronoun for the first time too 😅

I'm still way way early-days, pre-HRT, dealing with all the Fear, and trying to work on courage / learn & experiment more with hair & makeup. Your before's remind me of myself, and afters... Just. If I could be so lucky. It's inspiring. ♥
You are a ray of sunshine. It makes me happy to see my angels happy.
41??????? girl im 33 and look young i hope i still look young at your age
The hell? I’m 24 and I would have guessed you were my age
My autistic ass interpreted that as you had been on HRT for 41 years
pretty!
Congratulations
Best wishes for a safe, happy and healthy future!
Now I get it, I thought you meant you'd been on HRT for 41 years and 10 months🤣 I was calculating like crazy in my head! And it didn't help that, like others say, you look like you're MAX 30-35!
WHAT, 41??!!!?? i thought you were 21
You look absolutely stunning gorgeous and so beautiful
Do trans people just not age at all?
Wow you look amazing
41 years of hrt is possible????? that’s amazing!!! look at you go!!! i can’t wait to be there one day too!!!!!
Aint now way youre 41 im 23 and you look my age 😭💜
You look absolutely amazing!!!
41 WHAT

I legit thought like mid-late 20s area
Okay WHAT I hope I age as good as you
Bitch shut up you look 20 wtf

S/
You're very welcome
YOU ARE SO CUUUUUTE AAAAA
41??? Honey what is your skin routine!? You don't look 41!
Beautiful I’m 44 hit me up

Awwwwwww thanks 😘😘😘
Agreed! I was just about to say you look like you could by my 26 year old girlfriend's twin!
Haha no way
Thanks

That is not a thing, although that would be cool if it did randomly start happening.
I'm just 10 months on HRT and the hormones are not forever can't stop because our body doesn't produce estradiol like a cis woman and so we're like a woman in eternal menopause who needs to replace hormones
It's never too late. Never too late to be yourself and never too late to start down a path that you may have once thought impossible.
it's never too late to go back to our real life it's never too late to start our transition we just have to be extra careful with our health don't smoke don't drink and exercise take HRT medications regularly and don't miss any day and take care of yourself be happy 😘
Hahahaha
40 years without
Hahaha
I’m vampire lol
Yes I’m 😢
Thanks 😊
😘
Yes I’m really 41 😢
Yes I’m 🤷🏻‍♀️

Awww thanks sweetie 😘
Awww nice I wish lol
awww thank you so much for the words i feel honored to be your inspiration and well i'm at the beginning of my transition yes it is a slow process that we have to live day after day and learn from ourselves who we really are and don't worry accordingly as our body absorbs the agent estradiol becomes safer and more aware of who we are HRT helps us become safer!  did my pre-HRT in July 2020 😘😘😘
Awww thanks sweetie
Do you on HRT too?
Hahaha thanks I’m 41 old 😭😭😭
No Im 41 old sorry about that
🥰😘
Thanks sweetie
Awwww thanks I wish this for my life ❤️
Hahaha sorry writes in my confused way but yes I am 41 years old and I have been doing HRT for just 10 months
Hahaha thanks I’m really 41
Awww thanks
Hahaha right
No Im 41 old and 10 months HRT only
YES WAYYY!!!!:)))
Seriously, what is your skin routine?!!!
I'm just 10 months on HRT and the hormones are not forever can't stop because our body doesn't produce estradiol like a cis woman and so we're like a woman in eternal menopause who needs to replace hormones
Yes perfect u alright
How have you lasted so long with Gender Dysphoria?
Omg, you look so gorgeous!!
I mean your skin looks really good! What products do you use?
You're very welcome!
You're very welcome!
The real OG starting HRT 41 years ago must have been though!
I would treat you like a queen
yes like 3 months
a little cream every morning and night and I don't get the sun
Yep! Even post-op you can't stop.
<3
Awwww thanks 😊
well I use a lot of moisturizing sunscreen and acids to clear the skin
it's not that!  i am 41 years old and i am 10 months in transition
Awwwww you want make me in love ? Lol
Love you I would give it a shot
Nice, never stop please, the beginning is hard is when testosterone is low and you can feel depressed and discouraged because your body will go through a big change and the brain feels it the brain will fight the HRT and will try to make you give up so i say never stop and never give up it's your brain fighting HRT and your body will adapt to the new hormone that will predominate and then the brain will stop fighting it and it will start to feel happy is when you will feel happiest and that's when all depression and triateza drops away and when you get to that stage it's just to continue day after day your HRT
Yes never
😊
i think my brain accepte it fast. im somewhat in the emotional period qhere any happy movie or show makes me tear up lol
stay calm because it's like that and everyone goes through it check your hormone levels testosterone has to drop to almost zero at this moment the brain fights"	pknn6r	trans	1962	0.97	2021-09-09 01:19:26

HEEYYYOOOOOOOOO"	zwz47w	trans	1924	0.98	2022-12-28 03:32:40
My dad texted me a YouTube link to a Fox news story about a person who detransitioned	"I'm not even gonna state all the obvious implications of that. 


Does anyone know of a good video of a trans person talking about how much happier they are now transitioning? I'd like to text a link back. He didn't say anything, just sent a link. I'd like to do the same and send some trans joy back in his face ☺️



**EDIT:** I thought I already had an edit to this post but it isn't showing up? Rip. 


Anyway


I did some thinking and decided to give my dad the benefit of the doubt and treat him like he's coming from a place of genuine love and concern and linked him some of the stuff you guys suggested. Worst case scenario he doesn't watch or read any of it and continues to be an ass. At least I know I tried and that he can't play the victim and say I was in the wrong.



I suspect I will get a lengthy text within the next hour or two about how I'm still wrong and not trans cause of course he knows me best (🙄) at THAT point I will just ignore him and say nothing. The nice thing is my dad takes ignoring as a ""win"" and doesn't pester or bring it up ever again usually



Also some info for those who might not have saw in the comments: I'm an adult in my mid 20s, my pronouns are he/him, and I'm a safe distance from my dad (we live in separate states) thank you all again SO much for your advice and concern. ❤️❤️❤️



**EDIT 2:** Well I woke up to this text from dad this morning. I don't even know how to respond 😐

""I am glad you understand where I am coming from. Am am glad you are happy. If it ever turn to not being so great and make you unhappy don't to afraid to change back. You have a good head on your shoulders and you think things thru. So if it make you happy then I am happy. But I am still going to refer to you as my little girl [deadname]...... unless you want to take the name we would have given you had you been born a boy ....... Travis James.""

**EDIT 3** Okay so I constantly forget that reddit doesn't know my backstory lmao I'm so used to posting on less anonymous sites. 

**Travis is NOT my chosen name. My name is Bucky**

I HATE that name. He KNOWS I want to be called Bucky. He is saying he will only call me my dead name unless I agree to his ultimatum and take the name he wants. It's just him still trying to control me"	"This is a really good summary page that can be handed off easily to people who try to push transphobic ideas:

https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/
Eh. Ignore it. But send him 10 hours of cat parade (Mitchiri Neko) https://youtu.be/eBPfnj8_4W4 and don’t say anything else

You’re welcome 💕
tbh id just ignore it. He seems to already be twisting logic to fit the narrative he wants, so sending him back a text isnt going to change his mind.
[this is](https://youtu.be/YAHaVixgqew) a video interview with a detransitioner who isn't regretful about their transition experience. 

Really insightful imo
Or even just something breaking down the actual statistics around detransition. How rare it is - and how it’s often about societal pressure more than true regret
https://youtu.be/AITRzvm0Xtg 
let Abigail speak for you
I think Jammi Dodger (idk spelling sorry) has talked about it on his youtube channel. hope it helps :(
send him an article on the high amount of divorce rates from straight couples compared to queer couples
I think there’s a statistic out there that most people who de transition do so bc they aren’t accepted by their community. If you can find that or a video that has ghat statistic w the source it might help
Well I made a YouTube video for my mother when she sent  me a fox news de-transion video.

I called it Transition Sabotage.

The only person who knows your gender and your needs is you. Some people do de-transion, and there's no shame in that. Most do it for social or economic reasons. Some are more happy in  between. Ash Hardel has a great YouTube on why they are nonbinary and has some nonbinary guest speakers who de-transioned a little.

This is hard enough for anyone to do, if you can, isolate yourself from anyone who would hold you back. That seems to be the best strategy.


https://youtu.be/5VylOdHBel0
No such thing as de transition, that’s just transitioning twice. Maybe your dad would like it if you changed your gender very often 😂 worth asking
No one who sends fox news to someone is going to change their mind from being showed evidence that they're wrong. It's all about feelings regardless of facts which makes the whole ""facts don't care about feelings"", bs that much more ironic
Go to pubmed and send him a scientific article about the likely hood of someone  wanting to transition. Mabye ad the suicide rate of unsupported trans to drive the point home
My dad was listening to it in the car and it was about this girl who transitioned for clout points and then detransitioned because she obviously wasn't happy and mocked trans people and gender dysphoria and I wanted to tear my hair out. 

Then it went onto how masculinity levels in america are dropping and that you need to testical tan to solve this problem
Look up Ryan Cassata (may have spelled his surname wrong), he talks a lot about transitioning & his journey & his family's journey, he does a lot of public speaking & raises awareness about a lot of stuff & he's got a very ""this is Trans Stuff but phrased in a way that cis people can empathise with it if they wanna start understanding us"" type of vibe with most of his videos. I know he's got a spoken poetry thing where he addresses his dad & talks about how gender dysphoria feels for him, and he writes a lot of songs too.
""I've made my choice and don't need your input into my life, "" I would say to him.
I'd just text him back, ""thats great! I hope they're as happy as I'll be when I'm fully transitioned!""
My mom did the same, except it was a YouTube link on how TikTok makes mental disabilities a trend and attached to the link was a long message on how i couldn't be trans because she ""took classes on psychology"" and she ""would've seen the signs""

I saw you already sent some links, and i honestly might do the same. Maybe when I'm a bit older though, LOL
My dad printed out an article by a detransitioner and left it on the kitchen table with a note saying ""very interesting read""
You know, subreddits like this are usually ""drop the abusive bastard now and never talk to him again"".

I'm going to say what I've said before - if there's a chance his transphobic ass will turn around and respect you and love you, it might be worth waiting for. You're on your own and safe in your own place, and can text him from a safe place and not dig in deeper than you have emotional energy for.

One of my brothers used to be transphobic, but all I'll say is now he's the only family I have anymore, and he's a damn good ally.
Sam Collins, and Jammiedodger are one of my favorite trans YouTubers. This should help
Nice, just got it
I've found an interesting video of a person who detransitioned but is really happy that they had the experience. They really considered it two transitions vs. detransitioning, IIRC. Depending on the theory of gender that most applies to you, nothing to say that you might decide to transition again in the future. Or continue one long transition. Or do stops and starts.  I think all of that should be okay to do. I'm genderfluid so I think about this stuff lol. I'll try to find the link.
if the possibility of detransitioning makes it too risky to allow a child to transition, you would also have to prove that it isn’t possible to prevent the accident transitioning of non-trans people. unfortunately for people like your dad, this really doesn’t seem to be the case.

most detransitioners arise from a very specific set of preventable circumstances. if you don’t want your kid to accidentally think they’re trans but really aren’t, the best thing to do is love them and then get them the best possible trans healthcare from some real experts

I think I may have seen the same article. Screw Fox. I find that with trans issues, they always go with half truths, twist the facts, don’t say all the facts, lie, create an emotional narrative against trans rights, and/or blow things out of proportion. They always try to find a way to make being pro-trans a bad thing and they spread so much misinformation and hate. Unfortunately my parents listen to Fox a lot.
Faux news.  Best thing you can do is to set the parental controls to block that lying ass channel.
This is a brief comedy clip from Robin Tran that after coming out to my mom, I sat and watched with her so it was easier for her to understand.  https://youtu.be/xpnba-l3qfc
I know I'm a bit late, but here's a study you could link (sorry, not a video, but arguably better). 

[Factors Leading to “Detransition” Among Transgender and Gender Diverse People in the United States: A Mixed-Methods Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/)

> Of those who had detransitioned, 82.5% reported at least one external driving factor. Frequently endorsed external factors included pressure from family and societal stigma. History of detransition was associated with male sex assigned at birth, nonbinary gender identity, bisexual sexual orientation, and having a family unsupportive of one's gender identity. A total of 15.9% of respondents reported at least one internal driving factor, including fluctuations in or uncertainty regarding gender identity.

Feel free to read through it for more understanding, but what it mostly comes down to is that people detransition because of pressure from family and/or society. My math might be wrong here, but it looked like the total number of people in the study that detransitioned because **they** wanted to, is something like 2-3% of the trans people they surveyed.
I heard recently that most people who detransitioned were pressureed by those around them and how poorly treated them for being trans.
If your dad is a fan of some sport or has a hobby, send him a link of someone disliking the sport or hobby for some reasons.
Honestly just look at so many trans people online or im documentaries. I'm trans, ive been out since i was 12 and now im 18. I love being called a man, or being seen as a male. The euphoria i get every single time is unreal. I would transition in a heart beat if travelling and funds weren't so difficult for me
Just text back an image of a middle finger
I'll call your dad up and tell him about how my life is so much better now.
Say that most detransitioners do it because they aren’t supported or even assaulted for being themselves
It's not a video, but if he's a ""facts and logic"" type you could send him [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/) comprehensive defense of trans people that debunks just about every transphobic argument with primary sources. It's even sorted by topic, and there's a section dedicated to detransitioning!

Full credit to the OP of course, I just share it whenever possible :)

I stopped transition for several years (although I didn't consider it ""detransitioning"" more like just a pause) and within a couple years I looked more or less exactly like I did before hormones. My voice was a little different but even it kind of went back to what it started at.

So even if someone DID regret transition, it is relatively easy to reverse everything with a little time. Surgery is a little harder to reverse obviously, but that's why you should always do so much soul searching, therapy, and research before taking those steps, as pretty much every trans person does anyway. The pearl clutching of conservatives is tedious to watch because they can't even be bothered to actually educate themselves on the whole process in the first place or they would know that their fears are utterly misplaced and emerge from vitriolic propaganda coming from the christofacist media. 

This talking point from conservatives about ""transition regret"" is just such blatant concern trolling. The facts are clear that 99% of people don't regret it, and of those that do its almost always because of the increase in transphobia they then face. Transition related surgeries have a MUCH lower regret rate that knee replacement surgery, but you don't see fox talking about that.

Potential regret is simply not a justification for keeping people from life saving medical care. I'm sorry you're dealing with a non-accepting dad!
I’d take a few
Minutes and maybe find something from Dr. Z. I’m sure I’ve seen a video she’s done that talked about either family struggling to accept or even how much happier once you’ve come to terms with who you really are. Maybe even one where she addresses how you know if you’re really trans… 

It’s not hateful, and she’s a licensed psychologist with a specialty in gender.
I hate people like this.

I understand thats your father and stuff, but seriously dude, you should put that man in his fucking place even tho he's a relative, because thats some insensitive shit.

Remember that you are your own person and that you don't need to conform to other people whether they are relatives or friends.

And Travis James is such a shitty combination. Tell your father to acquire some taste, lmao.
Philosophy Tubes coming out video was artistic and also makes me feel insanely happy for her.
my mom does that last thing sometimes

""ÿeah, well, let's find something we could both agree on, (deadname) has a neutral version like (deadname but changed by one character)""

my identity isn't negotiable like what
[removed]
what your dad did wasn't wrong, he was trying to show you how actions also have consequences.

denying the reality of detransitioning by not listening to their stories, isn't that also invalidating their experiences?

you really should consider your transitioning and what that means wholly to you, your environment and the people around you in all sphere criteria.
Unfortunately if he can send you something like that then whatever you do won't change his mind. The best thing I can think of is let him know about the cold hard facts about life expectancy of trans people depending on whether family members provide an accepting and safe environment, compared to those that don't.

Also mention that if there was a medical treatment that had a 99% success rate it would be fucking worldwide good news. But hey, if your dad can only think of the <1% that detransitioned, possibly due to societal  pressures, then that's his problem.

Sorry for the rant.
Ignore him. He's being an ass
I de-transitioned for a few years because I couldn’t get the healthcare I needed and I regretted every day of it I mean I got some of my life together again but the dysphoria as well as the sense of shame and alienation from myself and my past was intolerable and I have decided to re-transition. De transition was not a solution but accepting myself was.
About 2% of the people who [detransition](https://fenwayhealth.org/new-study-shows-discrimination-stigma-and-family-pressure-drive-detransition-among-transgender-people/) do it because they question their transgender identity. De-transitioning doesn’t improve quality of life for most people. Ask your dad if he cares about your happiness and quality of life or if he cares about how people might view him for having a trans child.
I mean you could be petty and if he is still married to your mom you could send him any news article about people getting divorced.
Check out Charlotte Clymer on Twitter, FB and Instagram. She is an advocate for the trans community in DC. She speaks openly about her time in the Army, a member of the infantry. She is also a Christian…which may help when dealing with someone who watches Fox. 

[Charlotte Clymer](https://www.upworthy.com/i-m-transgender-and-christian-here-s-what-i-did-when-evangelicals-tried-to-pray-for-me)
Jesus christ my mom sent me that exact video yesterday
Plenty of detransitioners have retransitioned. Often the detransing is due to social pressure such as stories like this in the media. BUT the point you can use from this is that anyone can detransition if transitioning doesn’t feel right, including you. You’ll know it if you need to, but haven’t yet.
Weird suggestion, but maybe Blaire white would be a good bridge. While she talks about people who detransition, she also emphasizes how much transitioning helped her and how happy she is living her life as a woman. My opinions on her are very mixed (she’s starting to really show a lot of her right wing true colors and I’m increasingly bothered by her covid denial and worried her beliefs could shift from genuine concern for children to qanon level conspiracy) but she speaks to people with his kind of perspective and shows as an actual real life trans person that trans people aren’t the pedophilic boogeyman they’re made out by the right to be.

Literally anything out there, you can find something to back up a specific narrative. Even if 99.9% of people who transition are thrilled with it, there's always going to be someone for whom it wasn't right, and fine, good for them. 

I know loads of trans folks, none of whom have de-transitioned. 

I had to stop at one point because it was 20 years ago, and I just didn't have the support or the money to continue, but it didn't mean I didn't want to. For people who have de-transitioned, they all likely have their own individual reasons why, and that doesn't translate to your experience.
[Jamie](https://youtube.com/shorts/rQo5IEKRED8?feature=share) just posted a short!

If it helps, I'm sitting in the waiting room for my orchi right now and I'm so excited. Seriously. No man could possibly be half this excited about losing their testicles. Seriously giddy.
I came to this sub to see if anyone else was talking about this video. My religious mom also sent me this video this morning.

I am not trans so I can't give her any personal experience but I just want to give her the tools to see it from another perspective. Obviously, her info is coming from Fox, so that says a lot right there. But I know she is open to hearing about it.

She lives in her bubble but the conversation started last week because she just found out my brother's girlfriend (cis female) does drag. That was a whole lot for her to process but it did open the door to lots of questions for her. She thought only men did drag and I explained all kinds of people do. 

Based on our conversations, I don't think she's anti trans, but more so anti starting kids too young on hormones. I'm not going to pretend like I know anything about it because, like I mentioned, I don't really have a lot of personal experience. Every trans person I know (that I know of) transitioned socially or medically as an adult. I think every situation is unique and so personal.

I wanted to bring the question here. I know other people just say to ignore it, but I do want to send something her way. If she wants me to watch what she offers up, I want to give her something too.
Studies vary but I found this one https://www.ustranssurvey.org/informes#USTS . They have a section about detransitioning and found out that about 8% detransitioned, of that 8% only 11% detransitioned because they found out it wasn't for them. Other reasons were social stigma, pressure from parents or relatives to de transition, financial problems and or work problems, others detransitioned but planned on continuing in the future. If you look at other studies you will see similar reports. No treatment works 100% of the time but it doesn't mean we should discourage people from transitioning just because a small percentage deteansitioned for whatever reason.
Oh boy, the Christmas after I came out my parents gave me Gay Girl Good God. Talk about cringe. Anyone have good rebuttle books that I can start being petty too and send over?
Literally any trans youtuber
So. As much as you’d probably want to ignore him, or say something smartass…maybe educate him. Send him a quick article or link. There are a TON showing that trans members of society who aren’t allowed to transition are at a much higher rate of suicide. Is your mental health worth his pride? Theres also a lot out there showing that the rate of people who regret transitioning are lower than people who have common procedures, such as knee surgery. Nobody goes around telling people, “ahh Mike, I know your osteoarthritis is bad in the left knee, but there’s a 20% chance you’ll regret the knee replacement!”
It might be helpful to inform him that fox news has an obligation to entertainment, not news.
Jammidodger and Sam Collins both make YouTube vids . Jammi does seem to go into more detail though.
Alternatively you could ignore it.
I dunno if this would help but heres a ted talk from a father about coming to terms with and then celebrating his trans son.

https://youtu.be/GW8Plf_IXGs

Edit: its been a couple years since i’ve seen this and i forgot that he uses she/her to refer to his son pre transition which is 😬😬 
Some if his takes are outdated but I think the vid stuck with me after I watched it bc I’d never seen a conservative parent be ok with their trans kid like that
Tell him that divorce is like ten times more likely to happen than someone choosing to detransition. Lmao
Send Never Gonna Give You Up :) 

If not, maybe PhilosophyTube? https://youtu.be/AITRzvm0Xtg

You could always dump some Contrapoints stuff.
\[Here are some excellent statistics on detransition\]([https://www.gendergp.com/detransition-facts/](https://www.gendergp.com/detransition-facts/)). It may be worth pairing this with anecdotal evidence of trans people who have been positively effected by transition - good examples are Ashley Adamson and Rose Montoya (vloggers that focus on positive aspects of the trans experience). There have been lots of studies on how conservative people are more swayed by anecdotal evidence.

Hey, can u dm me a link to this bc it will be rly helpful for anyone who questions my identity. 
Also sorry you had to go through that, it's so horrible (btw this is for the original post incase u r confused)
OMG this is exactly what I need. I’ve been arguing with my parents about beginning HRT for the past year and GNC for the past 2. They say they just want to wait till I’m older but all my friends have started and Im feeling left outtt!!! 
Maybe this will finally convince them!
Tysm for this!!

Rofl yeah. I second this. Never respond to trolls with logic. Either don't respond or troll right back. But if you do troll, do it the trans way: *gayly.*
Omg oli love that so cute
Seriously. Because apparently they are trading things that are very irrelevant and silly. Least that's how I view what he sent em as lol
**I love you!**
Omg I might just watch it all

This is true. It's frustrating because when I initially came out he WAS watching vids of successful trans people who are happy being trans but now he's suddenly getting all his sources from fucking fox 😭 wtf happened
Exactly. He doesn’t care
Thank you! ☺️
I do have a pic of a break down of statistics that show the actual percentage of detransitioners that simply regretted it was the smallest amount. Maybe I'll just bombard him with a ton of links and info 😂 I know he won't take them seriously but it would get a point across
Just watched the whole video and it was amazing wow 🥺 I love that she acknowledged how people expect you list all the things you did as a kid that indicated being trans because my dad keeps jumping all over me for not acting masculine enough as a child to justify being trans now
Thank you ❤️
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbhv1Znv4Lk) might be the video! It's from April 2020. Jammi always impresses me with how well he understands the research around topics. 

His channel is a great resource for people who don't know much about the trans community. He has a way of mixing humour with facts that alleviates the tension commonly found in these discussions! OP, I hope things get better. I know this isn't an easy situation. Best of luck.
This is extra funny because my dad divorced my mom because he was cheating and has cheated on every single woman he's been with ever since 🤭
I have a screenshot of a study with those stats! 5% of people de transitioned because they found it wasn't right for them while 36% stopped because of their parents. Idr the amount of people surveyed but I'm pretty sure I downloaded the giant 100+ page pdf of the research simply cause I know my dad ain't gonna pour through a whole document like that lol
Thank you so much for this!! ❤️❤️ It sucks but at least we can find solidarity with parents who use Fox as a news source lmao
We've already had a conversation about detransitioners and what would happen if I stopped and I explained that the only permanent changes are body hair and voice change but in either case I can't imagine a universe where I would be unhappy with that because I've always wanted a deeper voice and more body hair if nothing else lmfao
I guess I'm constantly torn on what to do bc some trans people tell me to cut him out whereas others keep making me feel guilty for not viewing this as genuine concern from a place of love. Ik no one knows my dad but these types of things always make me doubt myself....which is a trait I definitely got because of how my dad treated me my whole life 😅
[removed]
YIKES that's sounds awful I'm sorry about that 🤢😬
Thank you for the rec!! 🥺❤️
Everyone has such good suggestions I'm having a hard time figuring out my best course of action lol
Omg I'm sorry you got a crazy parent too 😭 the signs thing is so fucking insane why are they so obsessed with that
Oh my GOD. 😭 What a fucking asshole lmfao
god that is such a boomer thing to do lol
Someone linked a video that was about 45 minutes of a person saying they were on T for 6 years and had recently stopped but didn't regret it or anything, maybe that's the one you were thinking of? I haven't had time to watch it all yet. If not that's at least 2 videos that don't paint it as something negative :)
Oh gosh thank you for all of these!!
Ikr? 😖 I didn't watch the vid he sent but I read like 3 comments before I absolutely couldn't read anymore. I mean it's insane. 

I also will forever find it funny that, aside from weaponizing de transitioners, people like my dad will be like ""I want to know more about trans people. Allow me to gather all my sources from cis people who purposely make trans people look bad and had never transitioned. Surely, these cis gendered people  who hate trans people have reliable knowledge on the subject"" 

It's like asking someone who hates baking, and specifically only bakes disgusting cakes, to bake a delicious cake for your birthday party.
I did send him a thing that shows the statistics show that most people de transition because of parents/other social reasons
LMAOO 🤣
Thank you for this insightful comment! The concept that you MIGHT regret something is such a stupid reason not to do something imo. Unless it's like, I might regret eating a snack at 3am 🤣

All I know is I'm 10 months into hrt and there is not a shadow of doubt or regret so far!
I KNOW RIGHT ok I'm glad you understood that edit cause some people thought it was cute and I forgot that no one knows my name on here 🤣 I'm way too used to Twitter and not being anonymous haha 


It's funny and stupid because my name should be one my dad of all people would like lmfao he just wants to control me. I was really busy today so I never texted him back but um yeah I am simply not going to respond if he doesn't call me the right name. It's so disrespectful on the most basic level to call someone the name YOU want to call them
I watched that one !! It's so good
Ikr like wtf you can't give me an ultimatum about my IDENTITY bro 😭 in the past he was like ""why can't you just bind and wear a fake beard and be a girl"" 😐
I can't tell if you're being a troll and saying trans people are all making a huge mistake or just me but neither is true. Also you couldn't know this but I've explained to my dad at length how I've felt this way and took years to decide if I was ever going to transition. Ive also given him plenty of sources and always answer any questions or concerns kindly. I am doing my best but the fact is he doesn't want to understand or be supportive and that is not you love and care for a child. It just alienates me.
Okay so I constantly forget that reddit doesn't know my backstory lmao I'm so used to posting on less anonymous sites. Travis is NOT my chosen name. I HATE that name. He KNOWS what name I want to be called. He is saying he will only call me my dead name unless I agree to his ultimatum and take the name he wants. It's just him still trying to control me

EDIT: deadname* not dadname lmao
I mean not really he told me he will only call me my deadname unless I pick that ugly ass travis name. I forgot to include it but my name is NOT Travis and I never want that to be my name lmao
Sure, I just sent you the link.
Facts don't matter. He's looking for confirmation of pre-existing opinions. If you showed d him the detransition rate is 1-2% and a chunk of that is social in nature, not medical, so we have 98%+ trans people are happy with their transition he would find another bullshit story to counter it. It's sadly a waste of your time.

You could say something like ""good for them, I'm glad they figured out who they were. It's hard to come out, it's hard to transition, it's also got to be hard to detransition. Luckily only 1-2% of people that transition feel that it wasn't the right choice. In general people should be given the opportunity to figure themselves out, with support and care and understanding, right daddio?"" or 10 hours of cats, whatever you think works best lol.
That wud be funny if she sent that lol
My heart belongs to the cat parade ❤️🙉
Is he religious? Cuz if so, Christianity happened. Religion will turn a person's brain to fucking mush.
my only reply would be “fox news? Seriously? Fox News? You couldn’t do any better than this? Fox News? Honestly come on now.” 

Don’t even try and explain why. Just completely discredit the source and let him process needing to find a source of information if he wants to have real discourse with you.
He sounds like the type who would say “listen to both sides” as a copout so he can agree with the side that feeds his preexisting biases instead of growing as a person. 

Tbh he’s being a massive asshole. He should be listening to you, not some Uncle Toms who Fox News dug up. If he wants more perspectives he should be listening directly to trans people, not the favorite examples of an entertainment outlet that hates us. 

I’m really sorry. If you’re old enough I’d recommend cutting him out of your life before any more of his disgusting views seep into you.
I don’t presume to know your relationship with your parents but I’ve definitely been careful with mine to add something like - “I know that any of the emotions you are feeling around this are because you love me and you want the best for me, but….” Insert argument.


My experience is that any defensiveness that they have often stems from thinking that we aren’t aware that they are acting from a place of love. Worry is a shitty way to express love. But it’s sort of natural for many parents. 

Anyway, addressing that maaaaay bypass some defensiveness. May not. Just thought I’d offer
yeah, ofc <3
I second this. Jamie's 10 year transition video always makes me tear up and it's clear how much happier he is nowadays :D
another fun article to send! “statistics for how many men cheat on their spouse”
Welp there’s also the option to be passive aggressive. Depending how petty u wanna be u could send the whole study and say something like “I can sum it up for you if you need to, it needs actual reading comprehension”
Isnt bottom growth also permanent?
Honestly what's best for you isn't for other people to decide, but you yourself.

I personally will be going no contact the instant that I can do so. Completely and totally, I value respect and my personal autonomy, and I have plenty of people who love me and respect me so I don't really feel any need to be around my relatives who do their best to bring me down.

But realistically you do need to at the very minimum set boundaries or you're just going to end up with a lot more emotional pain than needed. Like if you don't want to cut him out then it's probably in your best interest to set real boundaries with actual consequences or the behavior will not change and you'll just have to continue to deal with the disrespectful hateful nonsense he's sent you.
Uh I'm not suicidal at all fyi but someone reported me saying that I was. Hope it was not because of this comment
My parents have been relatively supportive to my coming out, but I have many trans friends whos parents are nothing short of evil, so I unfortunately have a lot of experience in this department :( if you want to talk about course of action I'd love to, i like helping people :D
I have no clue 😭😭
I think it's about the same person but this is her personal YouTube channel. [Alia's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/AliaIsmail)
Exactly
Ohhhhh well that is a completely different story then. My parents pulled similar and I just kept passively correcting and annoying them it hasn't fully worked. I hope it goes better for you eventually
That is true
Op uses he/him btw
He's not but he is republican so I guess it was inevitable. It just sucks cause despite that we had multiple conversations that sounded like he was really starting to understand me and trans people in general:/ I was weary but of course everyone tells me I need to be fair/show some grace and give him time to understand and accept this. But the more time passes, the LESS accepting he is. 


My mom is the heavy Catholic but even she is making an effort.
Yet, most scholars study things like religion and some of the great literatures of the old and new world are religious texts or influenced by. Maybe, its something else.
He's such a hypocrite because he's always crying about biased news sources and it's like my brother in Christ you watch FOX NEWS!!!
It is! Tho tbh I've barely had much of that and also feel weird discussing genitals with my dad so I didn't say much on that I don't think. I mentioned it happened but he's so dumb he probably doesn't even know what or where the clitoris is 🤣 much less how it could grow
Thanks homie 😔❤️ I'm just gonna have to set an aggressive boundary which is hard for me. I always feel bad correcting people for some reason 😓 sorry you have a difficult time too
OK sorry
Sounds like your dad has fallen to the conservative cult. Unfortunately, my entire family is in that cult and there is no way that I know of to get them to see the light. My mom told me I was going to hell and my dad compared me to a pedophile when I came out, so I'm right there with you.
That just gives red flags. Sounds like he MIGHT be engaging in terf or GC spaces if he's gradually getting less and less supportive. Caelan Conrad made a very extensive 3 part video series about this, they had a section in the first or second video about parents who want to learn how to support their trans child but end up getting sucked into GC communities. If you have the energy for these videos it's a very interesting watch/listen although highly triggering.

I don't really have any advice when it comes to this cause transphobes will turn anything you say against you to shut you up and make you stop being trans and it's really hard to reason with. But I wish you the best of luck, hang in there bud.
Not to say that there aren't definitely Republicans like this, but I am a republican and I'd never think of sending that to someone I claim to care about, I wouldn't even send it to someone I hate, because everyone, even those who are garbage, deserve the common decency of not being an ass for no reason, but if you find a link (I'm sure there's thousands out there) I'd definitely send one, because all you're doing is putting the shoe on the other foot, and there's nothing wrong with that, stay strong Royal figure (not sure how you identify but if I were to guess I'd say male?) And know that you're loved, and amazing
My parents are p liberal but they send me stuff like this too all under the „we just want you to be safe“ because look people regret it so you will too. Very frustrating
Just say “fox news is the conservatives equivalent of CNN” and watch his brain twist itself into knots
Shit. That fucking sucks. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Sorry that happened to you 😔 honestly with all the type of things fox news reports and I'm surprised he hasn't accused me of being a pedophile yet 🙄 he still has stuff of mine (I moved to a diff state) so I want those things back but after that I'm probably just gonna stop talking to him after that. I don't want to unload a bunch on you but my hope is I can find someone to come with me so I don't have to see him in person all alone
Mine wanted to die, so there’s that. Idk what’s worse.

Oh wait, I’m still in the closet after 5 1/2 years.
I doubt this will give you comfort but just know that there are Republicans and conservatives who are trying to get in and change views on certain things, and who do want the LGBTQIA+ community to feel loved and safe
Thank you 🥺 it's ironic that they say the trans cult makes you trans but they are the cult that's making people hateful. 

Luckily, my dad and I live in separate states. It's not super far but it's a long enough drive that he's not gonna put in the effort to just show up or something. So I think I'll just send a text of stuff I would genuinely like any supportive family member to watch to better understand me and just be like. Listen. I know what this biased news sources are saying and I'm not changing my mind. You can either be supportive or you can get lost 🤷🏼‍♂️
Thank you sm! 🥺 Also ur correct I'm a trans guy haha so King is good ☺️



Tbh I was just saying this to a friend. My dad is heavily Republican in that he always listens to Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, fox news, etc, totally buys into everything, always votes red, etc. He digs his heels in on most topics. But I don't think he hates trans people in that he would be loudly agreeing with the current events surrounding trans people. I don't think he cares enough about trans people generally existing to hate all of them. A Republican candidates views on trans people isn't a deciding factor for him (I don't think mf doesn't even think trans ppl are real lol) 



The problem is now he has a trans CHILD and that simply CANT be right cause he ""KNOWS"" his kid! This is less about how wrong trans people are and more about how it shouldn't be directly affecting him, ykwim? So he will use his sources to try and convince me I'm of the population of trans folks who will ultimately regret this and cry to my dad about how he should've stopped me or something weird like that.
I'm used to it now. I've learned that my family only really loves the version of me they have in their heads, not the real me. They only love me so far as I can make them look like good parents/ siblings. In fact, the only family that supports me is my brother who is also estranged from the rest of my family, so now we found solidarity in being the outcasts.
So sorry, you’re going through this.

If you send anything back, not likely to this, show him C. Jenner (no idea how to spell that gal’s name, but basically that transwoman who hangs with Terfs x/ ) on that channel. 

Like if they’re soooooo convinced on all the crap they say, why keep on a trans person. Let alone the major benefits they give their LGBTQAI+ employees.

(The answer to rhetorical question because want to include sources for anyone who needs a springboard for those dealing with “red-pilled” family members and/or dealing with gaslighting) 

One reason that I can see is because anti-trans/LGBTQAI+ speech it’s all profitable clickbait and they believe/know their viewers are dumb. Carlson even admitted on a far-right podcast that he lies to his viewers for “their own good.” And Fox’s lawyers say he can’t be believed 

https://www.npr.org/2020/09/29/917747123/you-literally-cant-believe-the-facts-tucker-carlson-tells-you-so-say-fox-s-lawye

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tucker-carlson-admits-lying-on-show_n_613fb9bee4b09519c5085ebd

Even the mask/vaccine mandates are uber strict at Fox despite all the anti-mask rhetoric/vaccine rhetoric.

And then there was the incident of them recommending hormone therapy as a cure to Covid.

https://www.thedailybeast.com/ivermectin-fans-are-back-with-even-weirder-drugs-for-your-covid-19-including-hormone-therapy

https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/foxs-vaccine-criticism-focuses-attention-policy-80067696

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/fox-corp-staffers-are-fed-up-with-fox-news-hateful-lgbtq-coverage

These links should also have links to original sources. And “Anchorman 2” is basically a satire making fun of how Fox got started in the first place, including being set up by an Australian businessman.
I’ve only recently discovered myself, but am terrified to open up to my family
There most certainly is. Unfortunately I was stereotyping hard, I apologize for that. Unfortunately the republicans and conservatives that get all the airtime and are the loudest are the worst ones. There are good people in most groups and that includes conservatism.
This is weird to say but I'm so glad to hear you don't live with your dad hahaha! I was worried. Still sucks but oh goodness does that take a weight off one's shoulders. I can't begin to imagine how awful trans kids have it when they still live with their unsupportive families... (I came out to myself and my close circles after I moved out for college, everyone is ok with it so I've had it easy on that part honestly)

But yeah I think that's the best way to go with unsupportive people... Setting that boundary and the consequences of breaking that boundary (for example restricting or completely cutting contact) + following through those consequences is very important. Sometimes it's the only way parents will realize that they do still want their child in their life and so they have to do the work to keep them in their life.
It seems that in his weird little world he's trying to protect you, so at least you know he loves you in his own weird way, not that it matters because he's actively hurting you in doing this
Thanks so much for all of this! It's so weird how they openly admit to lying to rile people up and it still works 😭 

It's been a long time since I watched anchorman 2 but kinda wanna watch it again now that you say that 🤣
Good luck!
I agree, and I wish that those of us who want people to feel seen and loved could get some as well
I'm definitely VERY lucky wrt being openly trans and coming out and all that. I went to art school in a very progressive town with a lot of other openly trans kids, so I was also out to close friends who accepted me without question. I did however wait to move to a new state to come out to my family and start HRT, specifically because of my dad. Before now I was living in our family house alone but paying my dad rent. I definitely wanted out of that situation as fast as possible cause I did NOT need my dad to hold also being my landlord above my head. Plus he would just show up unannounced all the time 🥴

I feel a lot of guilt and that's because my two siblings stopped speaking to my dad for personal reasons. I mean aside from transphobia he isn't a good dad to his 1 cishet daughter lol. He's definitely a narcissist. I feel a lot of pressure though cause I'm the last kid he talks to and I'm afraid he might go beserk or something if all his kids cut him off. I know it's not my responsibility but would my mom and her family understand that? And I'm afraid of the whole extended family turning me into that villainous trans kid that hates his parents for not immediately accepting him without question. Again I KNOW it would be probably better to cut them all out but I have a really BIG family yanno? 😓 Idk sorry for venting so much haha
Yeah I did reply to him and just gave him the benefit of the doubt that it comes from a good place. my dad shows many narcissistic tendencies and in those cases everything they do is ""out of love"" even if it's really messed up traumatizing shit. Neither of my siblings talk to him and they arent when queer so probably says a lot more than I could. He treats each of us in very specific ways. Ex I'm the golden child, or I was. It's a very weird boat to be in. The golden child who terrifically failed and disappointed his dad 😂😓
Will Ferrell is great! 

He actually started out as a journalism major too. Anchorman and Talladega Knights are part of what he calls the “mediocre man” trilogy which is designed to be satire of white, cishet male privilege from a white, cishet male 🤣 
(And wouldn’t be surprised if it also informed his George W. Bush parody on SNL)
Hey man that's ok don't be sorry for venting, that's quite a lot you got on your shoulders yeah. 🥺 I'm glad you're in a place where your dad holds no power over your livelihood. That said he sounds like a god awful human being lol and it's definitely not your responsibility to keep in touch with him if it's affecting you negatively and he won't do anything to improve. Cutting him out doesn't mean you have to cut out your whole family, and while you could explain to them why you did, you also don't owe them any explanation if you don't want to explain yourself. 

You said your mother was making an effort to support you, wasn't she? You should keep building on that and guide her through learning to properly support you as a trans person, same for extended family members who are supportive. You might not be able to stop rumors from spreading and bigots from being bigoted, but despite it you can upkeep good relationships with people who genuinely care about you, will make effort to be good to you and will stand for you no matter what. I really don't know what your relationship with your extended family is, but you have the right to pick and choose who gets to be in your life, how often you see them, what you talk about and etc., and who doesn't get to be in your life at all. What the rest think doesn't matter. Your wellbeing comes first. And if you can find those in your extended family who will hear you and support you, those are your allies and who knows, they might be able to change others' minds and cut the rumors short.
Well, for what it's worth im proud of you, it takes a lot to stand up and day ""this is who I am. This is who I want to be. And no one can tell me otherwise."" Much love brother
Omg that's so awesome I didn't know that! I've always unironically liked anchorman 😂
Thank you 🥺🥺😭❤️❤️ that means a lot

My teacher thought I(ftm) was a guy	"For context, I’m a trans guy and got back to school after the lockdown, I cut my hair during lockdown and I also got a binder. So recently I had PE, me and three of my female friends were running late for class. When we finally arrived he told us that we were actually supposed to wait for him at a gate because of corona. We didn’t know that and he showed us where the class waited. He also explained that only 4-7 people could be in a single changing room (also because of corona). Then he told my three female friends to go to another changing room while I go into another changing room where some other guys would change. Then he recognized me and said “Oh wait sorry didn’t realize you weren’t a guy.” and told me to also change with my three female friends. One of the female friends who knew I was trans just gave me this smug look after she realized that he thought I was a guy. I didn’t come out to the teachers yet, but I’m so happy that I pass off as a guy!
(also sorry for bad English, it’s not my first language)"	"That's so great I'm really happy for you, you deserve to be recognized as who you want to be, and I wish you all the luck and love when coming out one day, and last thing your English isn't all that broken 💕❤
Remember this next time you feel disphoric or anxious going out in public. You pass well enough that someone who recognises you didn't realize.
as an ftm you already are a guy so the teacger just made a lucky guess bc you look so handsome
I love that for you. 🥰🥰
Awesome! But I’d recommend not wearing a binder during physical activity, it can hurt your chest. Binders can be dangerous, but worth it! Also I’d be so happy if that happened to me, but I’m not able to try and transition.
There were few times I was able to get away with looking cis, and it always sparks euphoria in me.
Same, 2 guys form like first grade came up to me and asked if I was ret*ar*ed I said “no” and then they asked if I was gay and I said “no” then they asked if I liked to kiss boys (seeing me as a guy) and I was like “no’ then they ran from me and laughed, not sure if I should take that as an insult or not lol
What ”they thought you are a guy”? No, they RECOGNIZED that you ARE A MAN.
Moments like these are so overwhelmingly uplifting to your self confidence, especially when you're not out 100%. Way to go brother!
He didn't THINK you were a guy, saying ""think"" makes it sound wrong. He KNEW you were a guy, and then changed his decision cause he was wrong.
Pssst

You ARE a guy 

❤️
happy for you
Yayy so happy for you~
Congratulations!
*sorry for bad English*

me: Wait.. what??? This is far from bad!
your teacher didn’t think you were a guy, he knew
Well your teacher thought you were a guy because you are one! Stand tall my friend! 🤘🏻
This think where teachers don't know their student and will gender them differently is so weird for me because our teachers know the students
Lets fucking goooooooooooo nice dude
POG U!

It is the best feeling in the world when this kind of stuff happens. I'm so happy for you!
congrats dude, that’s awesome
That is so exciting!! Thanks for sharing!

Also honey your English is far better than a lot of people who do have it as their first language.  You have nothing to worry about there either!
nice things happen sometimes, :)
Good job ! Next step is someone thinking you're a girl at first and then correcting themselves when they take a better look. Very satisfying.
Cheers to you. You have to celebrate the small victories. <3
i felt this all too well. i know the person who ""accidentally"" misgenders me probably feels bad about it, but they dont know that they're actually right
Congrats, gives you that little hope. I remember once in school we had an all female trip to a private school where female scientists etc. Where talking about their experiences and such to try help motivate girls or something. I decided to go because I don’t like school, I was wearing pants and had my hair cut at the time (we have a uniform so I was kinda just wearing a suit) me and a few friends got stuck in a pool of other girls looking for the toilet. A teacher stopped us said the female toilet was that way then asked if I needed the toilet. I nodded and he pointed me to the males. I wasn’t out at the time so I had to do the shameful “I’m a girl.” In front of loads of people, I hated it. I pass pretty well too.
That's the best kind of feeling - it's always great to pass!

Once someone I knew didn't recognize me at all, but later they came up to me like ""I know that voice!!""

Never again will I use you in public, voice 😭
Yeah, I always have a sports bra on me. And also good luck on your end :)
Oh yeah voice dysphoria is a hell of a thing.

The only time I get misgendered now is on the phone. Up-side, my auditory processing disorder means I *never* want to use the phone, and my wife frequently pretends to me me on phone calls that are unavoidable 🤣
Thanks! :D
I have selective mutism anyway, so I often don't speak in public because I can't. It just sucks that the one time I was actually able to talk someone ruined it by giving me dysphoria 😅
Oof, sorry to hear that it gave you dysphoria! Selective mutism sounds useful for the voice dysphoria 😁
Idk if useful is the right word haha, but it is a nice break/excuse since I'm not expected to talk to strangers (if I'm with someone they just say I don't talk much) although the entire thing is anxiety inducing and gets me into troublesome situations so it's not better than talking 😅
Yeah, I was mostly being a bit sarcastic with that hah

I totally get that! Anxiety has always been a huge detriment to everything for me as well
Oh sorry I'm not good with sarcasm 😅

Yay! That skirt looks so fun! Does it poof out when you twirl? I'm a suckered for that. If not, I highly recommend a good skirt to spin in as your next skirt purchase. :)
Rock those clothes like it's nobody's business!
You slay them
Lass, you look gorgeous. I hope you're chuffed to embrace your female side, you look fantastic. I hope you'll post your other clothes somewhere 'cause we're the same weight and height and I haven't worked up the courage to buy me some proper clothes yet, but you're inspiring me quite a bit. 

Cheers.
😍😍😍
You look fabulous!
Congrats! I love your aesthetic.

Yes well i did buy like 20 things i think at onece like some 100 euro worfe of clothes and u whant more i need more
I recently made myself a crop top  out of an old shirt just to see what it was like... I now have 4 crop tops, 3 pairs of thigh highs, a short skirt, and I've ordered boyshorts and a bralettes. Fem clothes are a true gateway drug and I love it
This is true, except I have only one now 23 year old tattoo. I can’t stop buying clothes though.

Oh, don't worry about that. I'm not doing that. I want to lose some weight anyway to be healthier and what not. So yeah. Also you don't know what I look like at all, but I do appreciate it. Lol. I think I can pull off being cute when I put some effort into it.
You're welcome

I was only in there yesterday, bought myself a new pair of skinny jeans. Only €20. Bargain I thought! 🤣🤣😘
Cool!😘
Clothes is how its spelled 😋 Also the clothes are really cute! Sorry that I misunderstood I thought that chlotes were a type of clothes I never heard of before and I wanted to know where to find it🤣
Hm? sorry I didn't understand that very well!
Thanks. I have been on E for a little over 7 months now and it's already done wonders for me. Not many changes (other than booba and skin I think), but I feel so much better. Being able to be myself is amazing for my mental health.

No u. :3
The leggings (I know you can't see them but I promise they're there lol) and skirt are from Amazon. The top is from athleta.
I got it from Athleta. :3 it was pretty expensive but it has thumb holes so it was worth it.
It's all cause of the mask. xD I don't pass very well without it.
💜 Appreciate the offer, but I’m not out yet.
Could you dm me the links please?
Can I get a link to the skirt and leggings
May i too, get the link?
Do you mind me asking how much it was?
well hopefully they stay ""in style"" after this shitshow is over and you can continue to pass!
I wish you all the luck and support if/when you do come out. 💜
Of course! :)
I don't know if it's OK to post links here so I'll dm you if that's ok.

not sure if this is super ~*trans*~ related but i feel like all trans girls have a switch and I FINALLY GOT ONE IM SO HAPPY		"ALSO not saying that i bought one bc other trans girls have it, I’m just saying all my trans girlfriends were playing it and it looked fun okay please don’t scream at me 🥺
Transgirl here. No switch. Sad.
Can confirm, have Switch. Pick up Stardew Valley!!!
Sword or shield? (Or neither and I’ll just be on my way)
YAY! Welcome to the Switch family! What games did you get?
You are so beautiful!!!!
Omg you're gorgeous girl! Welcome to the club!
I'm a trans dude, but my friend who's a trans gal is addicted to her switch, so yeah. Also, Stardew Valley is pretty good and if you want, you should give Dark Souls a shot.
Transgirl without a switch v\_v.
How else would we switch genders??
Niiice! I'm without a switch but happy for you and cannot wait to have one too someday! 
P.S. You're absolutely stunning!💕 Stay safe💕💕
Got one recently for Sword/Shield, trans girls with Switch hi5!
I should have taken it as a sign when I pre-ordered one
Damn girl, you're glowing! Such a beautiful smile!
Trans girl: complete

Also you’re really beautiful
I am so happy for you because you can now play Breath of the Wild! It’s a FANTASTIC game. I had never played a Zelda game before and I’m in love! Even went as Link for Halloween (also, Link is now transition goals for me, FTM). And, your smile is radiant. :D
not related to the switch but you’re super cute!
Lol switch
omg you're so pretty. you pass so well
You're so fucking cute gorgeous and valid ❤❤❤ my hearts melt because of how amazing and proud and happy you look.
I have a switch. I really want the teal switch lite now though. Teal is my favorite color.
Beautiful. 😊
You look amazing girl❤❤❤
I think I'm in love! You're adorable <3
You are literally so adorable!!!! Trans girl here, yea I got a switch 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
They're so freaking cool! I got mine day one, I think I've easily put over 700 hours into it
Okay that smile is so radiant! I can actually feel your joy seeing it! Stay blessed
I'm actually not interested in the switch at all. I'll stick with pc and ps3/ps4. You're really pretty btw aaaa
Can also confirm. Has switch. I reccomend zelda and fire emblem three houses. :)
Yeah, my Link spends way too much time in Gerudo City. :)
Trans girl without a switch here... I want one for Christmas, I hope my parents will get me one :D btw you look amazing, I love your hair and you have a beautiful smile :)
Breathtaking.  Really, you are an extremely photogenic and beautiful girl. Just wow.
NEWS FLASH, girlfriend: Nobody's looking at the damned SWITCH!

We're all looking at YOU!  😍
Oh… They’re getting “Switches”. This will be so much easier to explain to my nephew.
I love my switch. Waiting for Pokémon Shield to come out.
Welcome to the club!!
I just picked up my Sword and Shield edition Switch Lite today!
I have a Vita so close enough 😂.
Be sure to get a supplementary controller in case of joycon drifting!
Hahaha... The first world
So cute!
Wanna have a switch to but it's to expensive...
Am a trans girl, also have a teal switch lite.
One of us one of us one of us
Getting a Switch is nice, but I can't stop admiring your beautiful face! You are so pretty!

Also, since you got that Switch, maybe try out The Stretchers :)
What's your username so we can play?
Girl this is soooo true, I even have the same color as you! Also you look amazing.
Heh, my boyfriend gave me one a couple months after I transitioned.
Gosh you're cute and you look radiantly happy. Have a wonderful day.
I sadly sold my switch because I was broke
You’re so pretty
Dayum girl you are adorable you should give cosplay/Lolita fashion we could always use more cute trans girls in these community’s especially cute trans girls of color.
Anywho with that out of the way can I get your friend code so I can add you
Love your smile.
Yessss sis, what games did you get for it
My girlfriend bought me one for my birthday. Aside from my PC, It's the only system I play on now. My Xbox one is gathering dust.
Ah! What’s your favorite game?
Damn you look so cute and friendly :))))
Nah /r/pcmasterrace for life. Also I love your hair.
Firstly you look breath taking you absolute Queen 😁 second I had no idea that was a thing 😂 knew I bought my switch for a reason! But honestly hope you enjoy all the fantastic new games!!
/r/transgamers exists too!
Same, hoping to get one for Animal Crossing tho.
I could probably afford one but I was really disappointed with my Wii U because I don't have anyone to play with right now. So many of the games I would want to play (Smash Brothers, Mario Kart/Party) are only fun on multiplayer mode. Just gotta wait six years or so and my daughter will be old enough to play with.
Also transgirl. Switch. Mario Maker fun. Suck at smash ultimate. Sad. Melee instead. Happy.
Stardew Valley is perfect if you're looking for a farming game where you can be gay
Yay for stardew valley!
Thank you so much💕💕💖💕💖💕
Ayyyy
Lowkey forgot all about animal crossing I’m def gonna add that to my list
If you get a switch I recommend the Paw Patrol game. My toddler can play it and the controls are nice and simple.
i like smash ultimate
You can be gay in stardew valley?
It's basically the entire reason I bought one lmao
i love it but am ass

git gud
Could you please phrase that differently i cant understand.

Learn how to dress and use make up like you (however much you used)!  I'm bad at looking pretty and you look badass.
I'm the same. I actually feel so much more comfortable going out as me, in a dress, then I did when I was living as my assigned gender. The shift in confidence has been amazing.

😌 I will continue doing me. I'm now free from letting other people's opinions effect how I live my life. I'm sorry about whatever is going on in your life that makes you bitter enough to go out of your way to say mean things to people. Dm me if you'd like to talk about whatever is really bothering you 💕 and know you're loved and it will be okay.  Also maybe try to follow the old saying of ""If you've got nothing good to say then don't say anything at all"".
I truly admire this response. You are transition goals in so many ways."	vuimxv	trans	1862	0.96	2022-07-08 19:25:34

Bandcamp shares a significantly more artist-friendly revenue percentage than anyone else but I didn't find you there. 

As an old punk rock girl myself I would check you out live in a heartbeat.

Also, this lyric is the story of my life:

Becoming a stranger in danger of getting stranger to you""
Holy shit. This would be a dream come true for me!

FUCKING SICK GALS
Went and listened to Small Again after I saw this post and loved it y'all are awesome can't wait to hear more from ya if you ladies ever come do a show in Missouri I'll definitely go
Oh, I just did. Thanks for saying this. Absolutely awesome song, excellent sound!!!
I just listened, and I’m enamored. I can’t wait to hear more!
Sludge Bunny! 
www.sludgebunny.com if ya wanna check us out🤘
Seconded
Oh you absolutely can!!! Currently we only have one single recorded and mixed, but are working on more.

If there's anything you need from us to play us let me know!
Thanks 🥰
Denver shows are the best shows!
That's awesome! what's your band called?
Love Small Again! I’ve always been a writer, but can’t even begin to imagine writing music! Great song!
OMFG! What an awesome name! I will!
Have you heard of the all trans femme hardcore band called G.L.O.S.S.? (Girls living outside societies shit.)

If you haven't, or anyone else here, you should but fair warning...

They got offered a record contact which they turned down but the plubilicity from it had too many people showing up to their shows and they had to stop, meaning they broke up the band. Which is a major bummer because they were the awesome. (that's how I understand it but take it with a grain of salt)
for sure! don’t worry abt lyrics bc I have a late night show so i can play explicit stuff!
We don’t have a name yet 😭, where still deciding.
Aww thanks so much!!"	127mxvu	trans	1858	0.99	2023-03-31 14:18:41
I'm trans and a biologist. We need to talk.	"  TL/DR: Biological sex is a phenotype constructed from a combination of traits. When those traits change, they shift the sexual phenotype. After medical transition, trans people do not match the sexual phenotype of their birth. And we need to get this right when we stand up for ourselves and argue with bigots.   
 

Hey guys, sorry for the throwaway account; I transitioned like 8 years ago, and it's nice that nobody knows that I'm trans. I'm also a PhD student who studies the sources of phenotypic change. So anyway, I see a lot of arguments on reddit when we trans folk or our allies try to defend us against bigots, and I think some of the arguments we make aren't giving us enough credit. A lot of what I'm talking about boils down to this: *""I know that sex can't change. My sex is male but my gender is female.""* This might have been true to a 5th grade biology class, but in reality it isn't accurate. **Sex is a phenotype and phenotypes can change**. In the womb, the sexual phenotype begins with chromosomes which direct the creation of reproductive organs, hormones, secondary sexual characteristics, etc... These product of your chromosomes establish our assigned-at-birth sexual phenotype. But it's also these phenotypic traits that medical transition can act upon and change. For an example: I've had bottom surgery, my hormonal profile matches that of cis women, and my breasts were ""home grown."" To say that my sex is male because I'm still XY would ignore the combination of traits creates my sexual phenotype, and overall I have far more female traits than I do male. Thus, my sexual phenotype has become female. **And this happens in nature all the time.** Many species of fish change their sex in response to environmental cues, social cues, or life history milestones. These fish aren't changing their chromosomes, but they are changing their sex by altering the traits which create their sexual phenotype. And yet no bigot would argue that a ribbon eel is still a male after losing its yellow stripe and laying eggs. The fish I study is always born as a hermaphrodite and they sometimes become male later in life for reasons that aren't fully understood. Their ""female"" reproductive system remains in their body, but it atrophies to such a state that it is irreparable. 

Anyway, I think we need to talk about how we defend ourselves against bigots and how we concede that we're still biologically our birth gender because *biology* doesn't back that up. I'll check in on this post and on this account so we can discuss together. I'm also happy to take any PMs from folks. And I would LOVE for some other biologists on here to weigh in! I'm just a wildlife biologist, but I wonder how a biologist from a different field would feel about this."	"Hey, this is a really great point and a great post. The only thing I might recommend to help bolster it is possibly linking to some papers/articles/studies we can point to in order to support the conversation. Thank you so much!
The only problem here is that transphobes don't give a shit about any of this.  Evidence will not persuade them.  They'll just find some other angle of attack and keep moving.
Finally someone who differenciates between genotype and phenotype too. I can't agree more 😁 Also I'm trans and a biologist too 😊
Yes! Thank you! Thankyouthankyouthank gosh I'm so tired of people claiming ""you can't change your sex!!"", ""trans women are women but they're still biologically male!!"" or saying absolute bs stuff like saying trans women are *male women*. Even worse when it comes to sports or bathrooms, suddenly everyone ditches the word ""women"" in favor of ""biological males"". It's like they're purposely finding a way or another to avoid calling us women.

And it boggles my mind and gives me a headache when other trans people try to correct me saying ""no we're male and that's okay :)) we're male women and we have to accept that"" no you stupid fucking pick-me moron, all you're doing is validating transphobia. Ugh. End of rant
Hey, that’s a great great post, it’s very clear and someone who is not in the science field can easily understand that. 

May I add some counter-arguments without existing counter-counter-arguments, as a trans MtF med student, my small jean pockets are full of them. Some arguments transphobic people use, is about genes and chromosomes. As you said, sex is a phenotype and reflects body configurations. But genotype can also play a role. 
They say males have one X and one Y chromosomes and females have two X chromosomes. 

BUT, for instance, some phenotypic females have a X0 caryotype, meaning they lack one sexual chromosome, that condition is called a Turner syndrom. And that condition doesn’t make the patient any less of a woman. 
There’s also a phenomenon in most XX women called « X-chromosome lyonisation », which states that there are indeed 2 X chromosomes but one is inactivated in the cell and all descending cells. 
Another example is Klinefelter syndrome, with a XXY caryotype. Here there are 2 X chromosomes, but the subject is a phenotypic male. 

Another example, the one I like the most because most transphobes can’t even say anything as they don’t understand basic biology and genetics, is SRY gene translocation. The SRY gene is found on the top of the Y chromosome and is mostly responsible of the differentiation of gonades in testicules and thus in the expression of a male phenotype. During sperm production in the father’s testis, the SRY gene can translocate from the Y chromosome to the X. 
What I’m basically saying is that there can be a Y chromosome without a SRY gene, and a X chromosome with a SRY gene. 
The X and Y then separate between 2 mature sperm cells (sperm cells and ovules only have each 23 chromosomes, maybe more or less, which gonna give chromosomic syndromes like Turner, Klinefelter as mentioned beforehand, and so much more). 
If the sperm cell that contains the Y chromosome then produces an embryo, there won’t be a SRY gene and thus no production of testicles and a male phenotype. The individual will be a phenotypic female with XY caryotype. 
Same thing if the sperm cell that contains a X chromosome with a SRY gene, it will produce a phenotypic male with XX caryotype. 

I hope what I said can help some of you argue with transphobes (I won’t copyright you if you use it to break apart some weak transphobic arguments)

Kind regards

Edit: typo
Thanks for taking time to write this up! It’s clear, concise, and the conclusion is unambiguous.
Molecular biochem major here! This is a really good post, people definitely tend to focus on the chromosome aspect of sex while almost totally ignoring secondary sex characteristics. Breasts are 100% a sex characteristic, and so is the soft skin and other changes that are caused by estrogen.

Trans women also don't get male pattern baldness (if they transition before thet process starts), they don't have the same rates of prostate cancer as cis men, and they tend to get breast cancer at a similar rate to cis women. 

Turns out sex is much more complicated than XX, XY.
I love this so much!! Thank you!

As a personal note, I am trans and a bioengineer! If I believed that biology was somehow sacred and immutable and shouldn't be changed or repurposed to improve the quality of human life, I'd be out of a job. If we can make custom antibodies to treat cancer or engineer bacteria to produce insulin, we can cut off tiddies or use HRT because it makes people happier.
Biology teacher here.  I Love what you have to say here and I hope your message radiates into the community.  However, I think you're defaming our 5th grade teachers wrongfully here xD
Problem is, a bigot will always find a way to argue with you no matter what science you drop on them..

I'd say spend less time worrying about what bigots (or anyone else) think(s) so you can spend even more time and effort being beautiful ❤️
You assume they care about biology in that sense.  Many just see gender as unmalleable.  It can’t be changed from birth.  Makes sense for most cis becuase they love and accept their gender.  Biology is just a euphemism of tradition basically.  They just saying what they believe can’t be changed as to them how could you it makes no sense.

Or or… it a code word for saying born with penis or vagina basically.  Still they consider it typically unmallable and don’t care about neo vagina or penis or other such.

What am trying to say is arguing with a transphobe is like wrestling with a pig.  You’ll just get dirty and the pig might like it.
Yes!! I took a lot of bio classes in college (unsucsessful minor, no time) and I try to tell people this all the time. I am intersex and trans, so the science of sex comes up a lot in conversations. Im grateful I didn't fall into the trap of ""chromosomes = gender"" and so on
Oh that's super interesting. Really rams the point home that people who claim to ""know basic biology"" really don't seem to know anything about biology, or at least have the basic understanding of the gross oversimplification taught to us in grade school. But wow biological sex CAN change that's neat
Was literally thinking about this today--I'm not a biologist, I'm a health care professional; same school subject technically, different application. :P That said, it was irking me that people say shit like this because... seriously, yes. 

Trans people transition to biologically be what they mentally are, and just because we retain medical traits that make our transition relevant and have to take an extra couple of pills or patches, it doesn't make our identity a lie.  

A trans woman taking estrogen who has had all of the surgeries simply ***does not*** have the same biology as a cis man, sorry not sorry, and treating her medically like she does is not only wildly unethical, it's ***BAD medicine and BAD science.*** 

You can see my mild rant and sassy comment over here, if you like: [https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/wf04xb/the\_comment\_the\_terfs\_deleted\_tw\_mentions\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/wf04xb/the_comment_the_terfs_deleted_tw_mentions_of/)
This is great. Thanks for writing this up. :)
Wait, so wouldn’t this mean that once you’ve pretty much completely transitioned or even started to, you’re effectively intersex at that point? Or am I getting that wrong…
Got a similar mini lecture in my first year bio class in uni.

Still don't understand how transphobes believe that science ends at middle school.
>TL/DR: Biological sex is a phenotype constructed from a combination of traits. When those traits change, they shift the sexual phenotype. After medical transition, trans people do not match the sexual phenotype of their birth.

The only issue we take with your post is this: it creates even more pressure to conform to the societal expectations of someone's preferred gender. Thinking of questions getting tossed around like ""At what point is phenotype altered sufficiently?"" which we already have enough issues with via similar ""passing"" phraseology. Or even worse, the draconian thought that gender and genital need to match being drummed up more, when really they don't need to.
Thank you for this post.  This is a giant pet peeve of mine and something that I wish more trans and cis people would understand.
[deleted]
I'm a medical worker and got my degree in health sciences, ***THANK YOU*** for saying this!!
This is good information! Im going to try and reword if I can so my 13 year old will understand better, but thank you for sharing.
Thank you for taking time to post this.
This is so interesting, I actually had no idea about this!!
I wish people could do the fish thing of being able to change without any help
Very well said, fellow biologist!
It makes me so sad that I need to be an expert on biology stuff in order to justify my existence 

Don't get me wrong, I always loved the subject, even though I ended up in another field. It's just that no other people have to deal with this and I find it so unfair
It's really nice to see another biologist here! :)

I'm a trans girl & molecular biologist and I really like your point that while we cannot change our chromosomes, you now have more traits that are typical for females than males. Even if trans women for example have a prostate and no uterus (among other differences to cis women), these traits are less relevant IMO

Also, something that I really like to mention during these discussions is that some studies suggest that the ""transgender brain"" resembles the gender that the person identifies as (explained in more detail in this [article](https://health-clevelandclinic-org.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/amp/?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQKKAFQArABIIACAw%3D%3D#amp_tf=Von%20%251%24s&aoh=16594695324142&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fhealth.clevelandclinic.org%2Fresearch-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know%2F) )
I always really love photos of [bilateral gynandromorphs](https://images.app.goo.gl/kWw3U58M5DryCwQB9) when discussing trans issues widen someone discusses gender as a binary. It just shows one of the more obvious ways that nature is so much more complex and beautiful than the boxes we want to shove them into.
Idk how read big words rn but I read some little ones and this seems like a nice 😌 good job science doer 😊
Legend
Serious question: I'm non binary and had an orchiectomy, but don't plan on going any farther with surgery. Is my phenotype now intersex? I really don't match male or female.
Thank you for posting this! And quite a few of the comments helped too, with the issue of having to deal with unmoving bigots. I hope you’re able to keep this post up OP. I saved it and will definitely be referencing the information for the future 😊
This is wonderful. I’m not medicalizing my transition but I will happily shift my argument to this if I’m fighting a transphobe.
I needed this.
FINALLY SOME ONE EXPLAINS IT! I like to argue that ”animals do it all the time so why can’t we?” But I don’t have the book smarts or education to put it into a believable way so that no one mocks me or scoffs. Phenotypes is a new word for me but I’ll definitely be using it from now on.
I just have a bachelor's in human physiology, but I'd love to dive deeper.  Any reference info you may have I'd love to read, too.
Oh shit that changes things, for a while I though only my gender can be changed, thanks for correcting me. Sadly you're gonna have a hard time telling transphobes that, they're just gonna say you've been ""brainwashed by the liberal agenda"" or some shit. Still, it's good to have evidence to back this kind of stuff up, there are people out there who are ignorant but are willing to learn.
Absolutely correct, but this is why we use the ""oh basic biology? Good thing advanced biology exists..."" meme. Bigots are 11 parallel universes behind, their minds aren't ready to be unplugged
Hi. I am a DPT. While I'm not a medical doctor, I did take the same anatomy and physiology courses as well as a ton of the same courses as a MD. While I'm no expert in the in the field of biology, endocrinology, or genetics I have studied these in academics and on my own. 

As a trans person, I have a vested interest to learn as much as I can from the medical and psychological research given my education and skills in reading medical literature. 

I am also a WPATH member. I recognize WPATH is deeply problematic, but I do gain access to their research journal which allows me to keep up to date with the most current research on trans individuals. 

Anyway, I can confirm that what I have seen in the literature is consistent with what OP is saying. 

I love you all, sorry for the poor grammar and what not I am typing fast at work.
So like if a trans woman doesn't get sex reassignment but transition through years of HRT would she be like intersex because of her androgynous biology?
I absolutely love this. I've made this same argument, but using frogs as an example. 
Ever hear of Jo Zayner? You may be interested in what they (Jo is NB but I unfortunately have not see them post pronouns) are up to. Yes, Jo is a 'biohacker' but also has a PhD in molecular biophysics and their latest post on IG about growing stem cells is exciting! I don't think anyone else is doing this kind of research. Blending ISPC (Induced pluripotent stem cells) into CRISPr genomic editing seems like a perfect fit together. Granted I'm just some silly person who like to read up on science and not a university grad.
(edit: Typos)
I'm naturally curious about science & learning all the technical stuff behind gender & transitioning & appreciate this post for that.

But...

Transphobes aren't using the purely scientific definition of ""biological sex."" They believe, wrongly, that chromosomes determine gender, & everyone needs to fit into the societal roles of that assigned gender. To them, even if somebody were to be on hrt for decades, have every surgery & cosmetic procedure done, & ultimately pass perfectly as their chosen gender, that they'd still be their biological gender underneath it all. They believe that our chosen genders are something we take off at the end of the day & not a foundational, unchangeable aspect of our identities.

Telling a transphobe that biological sex can't change, to their minds, is them winning the argument. I'm not saying we should be claiming the opposite. That's wrong. But transphobes won't listen to any explanation that explains it or what being trans is, no matter how much those points are backed up by science.

Ultimately, don't waste your time debating with close-minded transphobes. Explain stuff to people who are curious, but debates accomplish nothing except draining you of energy better spent elsewhere.
This post is dope! It's great to hear from trans people that are scientists. I am about to start my college journey and my biggest interests are environmental science and biology. They're such wide topics. I used to be one of those ""can't change sex"" people but since science is advancing constantly and society is becoming more aware about how sex/gender diverge, I feel more confident and comfortable to explain that there are in fact ways that trans people change such that they become the sex they identify as.
I don't want to return to monke, I want to return to fish. Sorry. Bad joke.
sorry if this is a stupid question, but just curious to where a trans woman’s sexual phenotype would sit if bottom surgery was not a priority within her transition? i’m not trans but many of
my friends have never felt the need to progress trans medically, past hormones, so wondering if i’m able to use this argument and for it to still be inclusive of them?
This is a great point and brings it into alignment with how we already treat people with androgen insensitivity disorder -- XY people whose bodies ignore testosterone so they have pretty much exactly the phenotype of a cis female.

Going through hormonal treatment (in the case of a trans woman) is sort of like giving yourself the end effects of androgen insensitivity  later in life. 

If we socially treat people born with androgen insentitivity as being a ""real woman"" (and historically we've always done this because we didn't know what chromosomes even WERE until recently, many women in the past have had XY chromosomes), then we should apply the same logic to trans people as well!
Good info, but I think bigots want to be argued with. They don't argue in good faith, they don't want to be corrected, they don't want to learn and grow. They just want to ruin a trans person's day. Rather than wasting time arguing with them, it would be better to put this info out there while simultaneously denying bigots a platform to preach their so-called ""basic biology"".
I love this post!  Personally one of the neatest things I've seen on this topic is this chart here: [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/visualizing-sex-as-a-spectrum/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/visualizing-sex-as-a-spectrum/)

[https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/File/051\_sad0917MontA3p-01.png](https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/File/051_sad0917MontA3p-01.png)

It shows a fun chart demonstrating a large number of genetic variations in humans which can cause sex and gender to no longer be binary.  

Quiet a few of these are very normal things that many men and women might have to deal with in their life.  And the solution is often HRT.  Transgender people did not *invent* hormone treatment.  We did not invent plastic surgery.  We didn't invent  These things already existed because biology has absolutely no shame in mixing or changing genders as it sees fit.  And we as humans have developed ways to preserve or change gender traits as we desire.

If cis people are allowed to correct their gender problems with hormones and surgery to make themselves look and be biologically closer to how they view their gender.  Then what the fork is the problem with a transgender person doing the same?  Their own arguments are not founded in any part of medical logic.  Only religious fear and their own insecurities.

Another fun biologic discussion I like to have with people is how transgender blood, skin, scent, changes.  Most people understand that if your hormones are different you can grow boobs and grow or loose hair.  But most don't know that hormones will literally change your skin over time to closer match your desired gender.  They aren't aware that your nose and tongue can change making your taste, smell and detection of pheromones.  In theory the pheromones we produce even change.

Probably one of the more fun things to me is our blood content changes.  Obviously a transgender person on HRT no longer has the same hormones.  But other values such as haemoglobin will also change.  This can muddle up our bloodwork causing transgender people to not fit inside of binary blood tests, or match their chosen gender closer.

Anyway just some random thoughts from me =-)
I agree with all of this, yeah. Maybe not the best argument to pull out vs people that *dont* want to understand, but that doesn’t mean that it’s wrong. 

Sex as we understand it is more or less a collection of binary phenotypic traits (with outliers), where having enough of one or the other side of it pushes you into a box labeled M or F (the intersex box exists but where exactly to draw the lines is a weird mess, and with the medical and historical erasure of intersex people, that makes it tougher still. Bringing them in really only adds an “it’s complicated” footnote to various sections though, so I’ll leave them out of this). 

Connecting sex to genotype is worthless. It may be “generally” accurate but there’s so many different exceptions to it that it isn’t a good metric. Plus, our understanding of sex precedes the discovery of DNA to begin with by a preeeeetttty good while. 

It used to be based on external genitalia, which *can* be changed with modern surgeries, at least in appearance and partially in function. 

You could look at something more specific like internal sexual organs, but we didn’t really *look* at those before modern medicine either. A woman that doesn’t have properly formed internal sexual organs would still be a woman, even if it would make her infertile (for example). 

The most reliable metric is to look at an overarching collection of phenotypic traits, both primary (which can be changed to a notable degree) and secondary (which can be very thoroughly changed). Trans people *might* qualify as either intersex or the sex generally associated with their gender identity depending on how one would define it, but they most certainly do not fit in the box they were first placed in. 

So even *this* argument from the transphobes isn’t correct. It’s not the *sensible or reasonable* argument, but it’s not even *accurate* either. Gender as a concept is defined firstly mentally/emotionally, and then expressed physically (in ways that aren’t rigid), either with or without medical assistance. But gender identity not actually biological debate linked to sex, even if that *is* changed under actual applied definitions. This is about sex instead of gender, because transphobes ran out of sane arguments practically a whole century ago. Now all they’ve got is farces and factoids backed up by “I don’t like them”.
Ok you made an incredible point but let me give you a counter argument, sex has meaning outside of biology, those words aren't from biology those words are lend to biology for use and don't always align up with that definition.

""Sex"" isnt about phenotype in many different circumstances, even if you say your phenotype changed, for medical purposes it may not make any real argument, since the arranging of your organs wouldn't be similar to cis, in philosophy sex can be about reproductive function and not a expression of bodily characteristics, it doesnt ever refer to phenotype in a theological sense, etc.

What i'm getting at is that your argument is great for people that actually understand enough of biology for it to sink in, and in moments where the word sex already doesn't carry a different connotation.... You really cant expect the average Joe to swallow genotype and phenotype while they are already having a difficult time understating that sex is towards body and gender is towards mind
I can add in some psychological and mental health perspectives, if need be. That was what I went to school for, and I also am studying Criminal Justice / Human Services. If you need help with a collaborative effort, message me! I’d love to help! I have access to millions of resources, books, journal articles, and much more at both of my Universities.
Love this post. I'm not even a biologist but I've talked to some and learned exactly this from them but one thing I wanted to ask? This only counts for transpeole who medically transition and not for those who only want to social transition right?
i’m actually gonna say use this if you don’t mind
This is an incredible post,  and while I've seen others like it, it simply doesn't get said enough. Thank you!
This needs to be pinned. Excellent and accurate points. Thank you OP🏳️‍⚧️
Thank you for the first real, well thought out, rational explanation I have ever seen.
Thank you for posting this OP! After taking some advanced developmental biology degree I learned much of what you wrote about. I have made these arguments to bigots before and it makes their heads spin!
that's pretty interesting, actually. thanks for sharing!
Hi! Thanks for the info! Do you have any other resources on it? I've been struggling with the fact I might be trans, and some more info on the biology field could help me... (Yeah, i've been working emotionally with my therapist as well)
This is some good info and I’m glad to see the support for the binary trans side of things. However as a non-binary person I don’t feel it applies to me. I am still transgender and I take testosterone for my own personal phenotype goals, but my gender is not going to be male even if I end up resembling a more masculine appearance because gender is more personal and complex than what sex society perceives me as. My biological sex is irrelevant to me. My genetics are irrelevant to me. My gender is not going to be understood upon appearance or even after an attempt of explanation. There is not much I can do about that and I’ve just come to accept it and be grateful for the people I’m close to in life knowing who I am. 

Transphobes are very unlikely to change their minds so I put my focus and energy into uplifting the community and living my truth.
The only problem I see is that this only applies to trans people who undergo medical transition. Many trans people are unable to access hormones, surgery, etc, and there are also many trans people who don't want these things at all.


It doesn't matter if we change our sex. Gender is what's important. Trans people are the gender that they are regardless of sex change.


I feel that it's more important to argue that gender's what matters, not that trans people change their sex
Peaceable science is so important .. good going
Could you send me some articles defending our existence please, i want to have better ways of defending myself from transphobes
Thanks for bringing this up. I often think of these topics, but I'm not a biologist, but rather a philosophy tho a rather polymath one. 

I also had to search a lot on what those gamic reproduction phenotypes are cause i wanted to use a extremely explicit gender neutral terminology because for most of my life I was agender so I struggled with saying that before HRT and after I began it my phenotype certainly changed but I was still agender. Actually a mix of agender and asymptotically woman and then demigender demi-girl demiwoman and then just a woman but still enby because of my herstory. 

So since most of the time sex has gender connotations evenmoreso for historical reasons, and in several contexts like in Brazil legal gender is called sexo, I prefer saying reproductive system/phenotypes/biotypes. And then I found out about the terms syngamy and gamic. So for long I used gamic biotype. And I kinda made neologisms like to express how these phenotypes work. 

In my understanding (feel free to correct me), these phenotypes are produced via the metabolism of biochemical reactions organised by the informational action of hormones, secreted mostly by gonads with ovarian tissue or testicular tissues or both (gonads without differentiated tissue I don't know how they work). 
Genotype is just the genetic code, as a programming code which organises how endocrinological metabolism works such that hormones are produced in such and such proportions as to trigger that and that metabolism such that such and such phenotype ends up as a result. 

I now am realizing I often unconsciously thought of gamic biotypes more like endocrinologies with the regular phenotypes whose engendering is regulated by them, cause several phenotypes are complex and not just  dependant on gamic categories. I'm also prolix and a poet, so I often express things by different wordings like I just said categories rather than just biotype.

But maybe gamic is all about phenotypes after all cause hormones are just a code in that sense that they signal specific biological processes. And so genome would encode endocrinology which would encode phenotype. Such that those phenotypes which are not only about gamicity would be precisely not only gamic phenotypes but phenotypes related to other factors. Like some AMAB people on natal puberty turn out very hairy, some very muscled, some really not hairy at all. Similarly to AFAB folks on T. And similarly trans women on HRT may have different results depending on a lot of factors, just like puberty hits cis women in diverse ways. In this sense gamicity would be intertwined with other biological categories.
""What, so just because you feel like a woman means you get to identify as one?"" 

Yeah. 

""Well, what if I want to identify as an attack helicopter?""

That's cool with me. Whatever floats your boat. 

""You aren't a woman just because you identify as one."" 

Why not?
If you are arguing with bigots, you are wasting your time. This is especially true if you are doing so online.
""Biology 101"" mfs when Biology 201 starts
Thanks, I might look for some journal articles cause you're not wrong. I just wonder how many I'll find since the fact that phenotypes can change is so basal to biology that no one (likely) publishes about it. More specific papers about \*how\* phenotypes change are available but I'm not sure how digestible they'd be.
This is correct. But having our own ducks in a row never hurts.  

Sometimes the goal is to change the national conversation. Not to change the minds of an individual.  

Example: imagine you're on Facebook and a transphobes starts telling you that you'll never be a biological woman. And your response is ""you're right, but..."" And you give this whole response about it. Then a 3rd party goes and looks it up and finds out that you're wrong. You've now been discredited by a transphobe and by any 3rd party who sees it, regardless of what their position was to start.   

So let's flip it. You give an accurate response. The transphobe goes off on whatever tangent but the 3rd party says ""oh, that trans person is right. They really do change their phenotype. Interesting."" You've now won that battle, though you may not realize it.   

This is the real goal of these conversations. Not to win the transphobes over. To win the 3rd party over.  

This is the actual strategy internet trolls use. Their goal is never to win against you specifically. It's to convince a bystander of their position. And that is much more valuable in an online forum because for every 1 person you respond to, easily 100 others could see that response.
Dyed-in-the-wool transphobes don't care, but people who are otherwise decent yet hold transphobic beliefs out of ignorance will take good evidence and change their stance.   


Source: a lot of friends that started out being pretty damn transphobic but are now vocal allies to the trans community after I and others came out, and provided sources to look to when they wanted questions answered.
The crazies didn’t care about the truth that vaccines are safe either, but most professionals care about their integrity.  Imagine discovering something important only to be a historical laughingstock for ridiculous claims about gender or sex.  

There will always be nutjobs and karens, but the whole point of science is to move us beyond all that noise and to shame the loathsome scam artists who lie to the world for personal gain.
Basically just ""this sign can't stop me because I can't read"" energy
Exactly. There's a video by Lily Alexandre on this. TERFs are wrong about biological sex and everything else is its name. I highly recommend it.
The point isn't changing a bigots mind. We all hope we would, but to openly prove ""muh facts > feelz lol"" ignoramus' wrong using objective facts for all to see will help win fence sitters who become unsure when real science is brought into the fray. We need labs and papers on the subject though. 

I think crispr and genome editing has a lot to offer here as well. Jo Zayner is one of us and frankly, should have our support in my opinion, but I'm just me so I can only speak for me and fangirl on my own behalf.
(edit: typos)
I'm happy to know that I'm not the only one!!
Im trans and took AP bio last year. Even that introductory course teaches you enough biology to understand this difference. 

Im starting to think bigots are just really stupid…
I’m trans and studying in biology as well! Though I’m not far enough along to hear about a lot of this stuff =0
Hahaha thanks for the rant!
It’s not “like” they’re doing that with the term “biological male”. It is 100% a “technical” workaround (which isn’t even actually accurate) to avoid doing the bare fucking minimum without seeming like an outright bigot.
The word female itself has gender connotations to begin with. At least most often!

Often transphobes project gender on gamic/sex phenotype and then they go still conflating both even if they can also be mindful of gender identity they do it in a really cisnormative way. 

But also gamic phenotype can and do change and it's a spectrum. 

XD 

And also I think of this as also relating to what I call body identity or gamic identity, what gamic phenotype, endocrinology, fits me, and if it matches someone's current or natal biology then they just already fullfil their identity. If not, it becomes desire. But at the same time, actually it's always desire it's just that in case of matching it's already fulfilled by default. 

So hell yeah biology changes. Next. 

Also like even before I was a woman (I was an agender asymptotical woman before by asymptotical I mean my gender identity approached womanhood and nearby genders in the female/feminine gender identity spectrum without ever reaching it tho i only found that recently) I still was having my whole phenotype changed with HRT. 

And then I just had my gender identity changed.

Now I'm almost non-enby but my herstory makes me enby and I'm really euphoric by this way I'm still being enby.
All excellent points! The only reason I didn't go deeper in the genetics part of the conversation is because A) it gets really muddy really fast and B) natural selection acts on the phenotype and not the genotype. Thus in studying traits, phenotypes, and evolution at the organismal level, we tend to use the concept of phenotype and how it interacts with/is affected by the environment that informs our conclusions. Not to say we don't take genotype into account! Just that changes in the phenotype affect evolution when they have a heritable genetic basis.
Exactly! I always mention this!
Very sorry!!!
>GFluidThrow123 put it better in a comment above which I would go look at, but to summarize our points: the point of arguing with bigots online isn't to change their mind, but rather to inform the people who see the argument and maybe win them over.
It disappeared, can we read it please?
You're not wrong, and I don't disagree. It's an issue that I don't feel ready to tackle. In an ideal world we wouldn't have to defend ourselves from anyone, and conversations like this would be irrelevant. All I'm hoping to achieve with this is to give whoever needs them some tools to defend themselves with.
I think the counterargument to that is that if we accept the premise that there has to be some percentage match to be valid in a certain biological sex, how do you reconcile that with cis people who don’t meet that requirement? For example we see cis women not meeting hormone level requirements in the Olympics, something that a trans women can pretty easily do. So what happens is trans women can now be declared more biologically female than cis women by this measure. So unless you agree with that conclusion, something is wrong with that premise and it’s probably not useful to think of biological sex categories as a value that can be compared or a threshold that needs to be reached but more that it’s only really useful when we’re talking about large groups and not as useful when we’re talking about individuals
It's a tool, it's outcomes depend on how we use it. I'd hope it's used like xenogenders - expand the pool of definitions until the concept dissolves entirely (as it should be)
Or in other words, how would you explain it to an 8 year old that it makes sense to them….
I'll think on this and maybe report back to you tomorrow when I should have more time.
Let me know what you come up with! I'm always trying to come up with simpler ways to explain things without degrading the message.
Thank you for taking the time to read it.
No. Being intersex is congenital.
I'm hoping to find time this week to gather some resources for folks, but I'm not sure if I'll have that time until this weekend or not.
Im hoping to find time to look for sources and resources later this week. If you have time, do you think you could provide some of your WPATH resources as well? I plan to EDIT the original post to include links and I can add yours as well
There's no ""one big trait"" which defines a person's sexual phenotype. Just like any other phenotype, it's a combination of traits that add up to something that lands somewhere on a gradient of human sex. Nature doesn't care about the way we define words, and nature rarely follows all the rules we think it should. Sex is just another example of this. A typical cis person will typically develop sets of sexual characteristics that add up to a sexual phenotype that we recognize as male or female. But, we as a society also don't strip people of these labels when they don't have a functioning reproductive system, have atypical hormonal levels, or have a ""disorder"" of the X or Y chromosome. Thus, we as society recognize that a woman who's had a hysterectomy isn't less of a woman now. So for the purpose of sex determination in humans, we look at the whole package—we look at the combination of traits which define sex. To my knowledge, there isn't anybody or any agency that defines how many traits are required to be lumped in with whichever binary sexual phenotype. There may be professionals which define the sexual genotype though.   


Long story made short: I'm not the judge of who has enough of which sexual traits to be whatever sex. And I don't think anybody is.
This is awesome, thanks!
You're not wrong. I'm just hoping to give folks some tools to deal with bad actors who claim *""But you're not biologically male""* or *""But you're not biologically female""*
I hope you do!
I hope to find time to look for some this week, but it might end up being this weekend
Which is really interesting rn if we think about semiotics, and how information in this sense is close to a sense of meaning , cause the particular formal structure of oestrogen molecule as the particular organisation of matter is different than all those processes encoded. And it's not a direct and inevitable cause-effect relationship outside of biology. Precisely because software coding pressuposes a decoding which is a process so that the correspondence is given, but this implies something very similar to interpretation. 

Also it reminds me of thomistic concept of information as envolving some kind of virtual existence of a form within another without being in the actual configuration of matter, contrasting with transformation which is rather   when the form of something not in a virtual way but in it actually being the configuration of matter (or the predicates of matter) and then being transfered to another being such that it acquires its property. This concept talks about something existing in some being not as a trans-formation, but as information. Which relates to the Cartesian notion of objective reality, a way of the Sun existing in idea and not just as an an actual object in the world. Interestingly this contrasts with the way that Husserlian phenomenology deals with the similar relationship between cognitive subject and object, by saying that intentionality is a mode of being of the object in its inexistence in the mind, as consciousness is able to point towards ideal objects which coincide with the real one if they're real or with a possibility of an object or even with the impossibility of an object (which at the same time has a meaning like square round and it's precise its meaning which implies its impossibility ). I think these concepts are complimentary. And I just wanted to share my thoughts with the relationship between IT concept of information and epistemology/metaphysics/ philosophy of mind. And to explain in which sense I think of the phenotype and metabolism as the meaning of the hormone even if there's not awareness or sentience or mind but there's some trait in common with it. And actually the decoding process is probably secured by a hugely complicated biochemical metabolism within each sell therefore creating a correspondence by the sense that when such and such gene is activated such and such endocrinological process will occur and that when such and such hormone enters the cell and binds to a receptor such and such gene will be activated and such and such enzyme will act so that the metabolism gets regulated in such and such ways. This process of decoding is present in the basic structures of life. And therefore creates this relationship which is similar to that of information and intentionality in epistemology / theory of mind. So we are now having a set of decoding processes / structures and code and therefore meaning in a broader sense of the word, but we still do not have the reflexivity that consciousness (which usually means self-consciousness implies). And not even perception. 

It also connects with the latter developments in digital physics. Like Wheeler's it from bit and Seth Lloyd's Programming the Universe concepts/works. 

My whole point is that that thing conceived by Thomas Aquinas as information vis a vis transformation and by René Descartes as esse objectivum vis a vis ens reale and by Husserl and Brentano as intentionality as the being- pointed-towards in a mode of mental non-existence are happening precisely already when biology works via information, coding and decoding in molecular biology.

Anyway. Big ADHD digression. 

Then sometimes I just said ""I want that body historically considered female"" xD or using AMAB/AFAB in an analogical/metaphorical way. 

Other times I followed an advice of an enby biologist and friend of mine when they coined words like testi and ovari, but I kinda or explained it's not about the actual gonads someone has, or I tried to make it explicit by saying testostendocrinogenic (engendered by / related to the engendering done by testicular and ovotesticular hormones) or ovariendocrinogenic. Then after seeing people talk about biology as testosterone-dominant endocrinology, estrogen-dominant endocrinology plus the tem estrogenizing... I know use the wording of estrogenized or estrogen-progesterone endocrinology / biotype / gamic biotype (cause often there's progestogens even if just as antiandrogenic progestins) to talk about. 

And I think the gamic categories we articulate in thought are intervals in the spectrum of gamic phenotypicality. 

So genotype should be completely irrelevant as you said, so properly with even more knowledgeability than me as a biologist, comparing to me a layperson. 

And at the same time even hormones tbh tho it's actually what the hormones code which is what matters, but in a sense that it's a complicated set of traits engendered by gamic hormones, and also hormones themselves are a component of gamic phisiology... 

So my whole body and our whole bodies just begin operating on a new OS sorta. And in cis women which are not gamically transitioning out of E/P endocrinology, the gamic hormones endocrinology is encoded by genome. On us, rather it's bio-technologically engendered with HRT such that we jump right over to the endocrinology part which is what is encoded in gamic genome but without really having it being provided by our genome or by our gonads but exogenously provided. THEN, what gamic hormones encode follows just as in cis women's biology, with some differences. 

This means our whole way of being biologically changes, even our gonads began changing to a new gamic phenotype. 

So it's also important for us to articulate not only that gender isn't synonymous or determined by phenotype at birth as if it was destiny, but rather that biology isn't destiny in the precise sense that gamic phenotype does change. 

So it's not even that despite my current pre-op genitals I'm an estrogenized AMAB or just E/P endocrinology person just like anyone, as if my girldick still belonged to another gamic phenotype. It's much more than that. My girldick has entered second puberty too as I entered it and has become estrogenized.

I want to articulate all these reflections in a book of lesbotransfeminist essays I'm writing. 

So really thank you a lot for your post here, OP. 

Also if you ever wanna have interesting convos on these topica, I'm down for it.
Sounds like an easy set of papers for an expert to publish, just for the purpose of putting it out there.  Maybe the context could be this exact topic, to get over the hurdle of why something considered basic should be published in the first place.  

I’ve heard of hacks out there informing policy with blatantly false “medical recommendations” that are obviously wrong medically.  This is a time when we really need the body of peer reviewed work to close the gap for us so we have solid ground to stand on against the grift and fascism.
Honestly, just throw a few links in your post if they're relevant, regardless of digestibility. It at least gives us something to point to.
Are there textbooks or publicly available lectures that one could cite? Its gotta come up at some point during studying, no?
Forrest Valkai, a biologist and science communicator on TikTok and Youtube has a 30 minute video that essentially goes over this. He sites 230 sources at the end of the video, I just direct people to that video and those sources when they argue that sex is binary. Here's the link: https://youtu.be/szf4hzQ5ztg
I'm also glad in advance about those articles. I want to learn more on the topic. And I already read most of the introductory texts except those more like college level texts on the specific details of all that. Which I haven't done.
You might try looking on google scholar. If there are no sources, where are you getting the information from?
I came to here to say this, but I don't need to. You hit the nail on the head! Don't argue to convince your opponent. Argue to convince onlookers.
And then those 100 others repeat the process, influencing 100 more each, and so on.  This is why truth and morality win in the long run every time and it’s why the fascists need a new gimmick every couple of years.  

I’ve watched them be defeated consistently in the “marketplace of ideas” on every single point they have ever tried to make, for 21 years straight.  When they’re done with us, they’ll attack someone else with some other pile of lies and baloney because lying and scamming are literally the only things they know how to do.
The whole subject being brought up is somewhere between a red herring, motte and bailey, sealioning, a flat out insult, and likely part of a gish gallop; it is bait to engage with an argument that is more challenging and irrelevant to the matter at hand. It's a stupid 'gotcha' and doing the 'well, akshully...' thing isn't the right move.

Let's be clear, even if sex can't be changed it changes absolutely nothing about transgender; gender and sex aren't cause and effect.

What slice of population will buy ""sex can be changed"" but not ""gender is socially constructed?""

Accusing the other person, rightly, from fleeing from the point is much more rhetorically effective. Everyone who would entertain the ""sex can be changed"" argument will buy the easier to digest gender arguments, and people who aren't there are liable to place greater scepticism on your opponent when you point out them running from the argument; if their position was strong they'd not need to deflect.
This is the exact reason I ever say anything online at all concerning politically charged topics, such as my own existence as not only trans, but non binary, indigenous and autistic. If I was out to change a single person's mind about something that they were vehemently against, I would quickly run into a(n) (il)logic loop from the other person that cannot be falsified in any way. This would frustrate me to the point of shifting my passive suicidality to active very nearly everytime it happened. In short, if that was my goal in online discourse, I wouldn't be here. The goal of convincing people on the periphery of any given discussion is much more attainable, if invisible at first.
I'm also trans and a biologist, you definitely aren't the only one! Of course there's Julia Serrano as well. I still haven't gotten to her later books, but Whipping Girl was great and she's written some really good essays that are available online.

I really appreciate your post too, it's something I find myself frustrated by quite often. Best of luck with your PhD!!
I completely agree with you ! Phenotypes are what we see, and even though they are closely related to genetics, they’re the ones we rely on to pursue evolution throughout the ages !

Also yes, genetics could seem simple but damn it quickly gets pretty much impossible to understand. What I said here are things I learned in my first 2 years, when we got taught the basics of the human physiology, cell biology, microbiology and genetics. And even with the superficial 1% basic things taught in those lectures and classes, damn that’s hard, but that’s also quite fascinating !
Winning them over and changing their minds are fairly synonymous though, right? I admire your optimism and positivity but the world does not work like that. A bigot will always be a bigot in my mind. Even if they say to your face they agree or act the correct way to your face, they will always have negative views. It doesn't happen just in the lgbtq+ community, but in all aspects of life from politics through to religion... As I said, better spend your energy being gorgeous (which I'm sure doesn't take much effort).
Had to upload it, but here, lol; I uploaded the entire post if ppl want context, but otherwise skip to after the "" - "" break.

Another consideration, what about genders that don't fit the binary in the first place? What about people that want a phenotype that doesn't typically occur, such as people who wish to be bigenital a la r/Salmacian or neither a la r/nullo for examples?
That was my only corollary to this so well written position. What about people who identify as trans, but haven't gotten top & bottom surgery or will never pursue those surgeries? I feel trans even though I don't think I will get bottom surgery (for now).

I'm definitely looking forward to your example the next time transphobic information is spouted within and earshot or glance of a computer screen. Thanks!
I think your point is still important but then another point is to defend the notion that gender isn't biology. I usually do this via history, anthropology, sociology, psychology. My strategy has been to argue that everyone's gender identity is all about to which social group / set we whose belonging is part of our personal identity. But this was start i was a hardcore gender nominalist. But I had to develop a really tough argument which went on by saying historically gender named gender roles and not just how we saw the body (cause in several societies it's not really a synonym relationship and also the concept of genders since the beginning involves several nonbiological components even spiritual ones not just in biology) and that since gender roles are known in humanities and in feminism and in LGBTQIA+ studies/movements to be homonymic almagamations, therefore there has been a semantic emptying of these categories in how they were articulated in the language games (Wittgenstein). 

And it's not really the point that we should all be agender, cause if the meaning of a term is lost, so the meaning of its negation is lost as well. 

And then by virtue of losing any meaning, there was only a pure signifier. And hence we identified to the signifier even tho the reasons we do so may vary as particular concrete psychological phenomena of how the personal and gender identify are formed. Some people might have a particular meaning of gender in mind when their gender identity is formed.

And then I circumvented circularity by claming the distinction between names and what is named. As the definiens is woman and in the definiens the word woman appears as this linguistic phenomenon different than woman as the person. Tho it's a bit metalinguistical nonetheless. And the possibility of translation by appealing to a previous meaning and so that there were maps between languages. 

Then I had a huge paradigm shift. You know what? Language is a culture and society thing SO there's sociolinguistical social groups given by this nominalistic gender identity as a social phenomenon. And then there was the possibility of political identity with respect to these social groups. And then I realized that it's all about socially constructed historically determined social groups (some sort of social autopoiesis). Cause what is the communality between us all women is that we are identifying with womanhood even if it doesn't mean femmehood or a certain gamic phenotype. And it is highlty unconscious at most times and denial and unacceptance and all this like not being confident happen but there's this belonging to a set / social group as constituint of personal identity and the specific biopsychosocial process of how the identity is formed may vary from person to person. In this sense gender biology is gender identify biology which is the neuroscience of identity. 

But recently I reinterpreted my reading of Sandy Stone's The Empire Strikes Back and I'm coming back to my old argument but in light of my social understanding of gender. Cause these social groups were considered as meaning the gender roles labeling them, and so it would have a relationship with genders naming performances of self expression but seen as simultaneously social groups , social groups of gender performance , but then as the meaning of gender changed, the whole articulation of this field changed, as gender lost its previous meanings new names appeared like butch, femme and the anatomical meaning now gets labeled by gender neutral words cause in serious biology people don't project gender onto female/male even if those words are used and having historical gender connotations and still in the society at large, for biologists they don't determine nor are synonyms with gender identity categories like woman, man , enby. 

But this pressuposes the feminist and LGBTQIA+ deconstruction of prejudices which conservatives don't take for granted, but rather oppose. Then  there would need be given the feminist and LGBTQIA+ critique of gender roles like in Beauvoir, Preciado, Foucault, Butler, Andrea Dworkin, Sandy Stone, Leslie Feinburg, Kate Bornstein, and in books like Joan Roughgarden's, Anne Fausto Sterling's and Gender: An Ethnomethodological Approach. 

But also there's a rhetoric importance in your point. 

If someone claims womanhood means gamic/sex biology THEN by your argument I claim they can't say I am not a woman and that their usual argument for transphobia and excluding all trans people doesn't hold so we might then deal with more subtle forms of transphobia like cisnormative pseudo-allyship , and also at the same time gamicity (just coined it to save time in writing) being a spectrum, people would need to have a whole sort of complicated criteria and checking which would be just difficult and at the same time point towards the more social meaning of gender, and then by this plus deconstructing gender roles, we could support those of us who don't seek HRT for instance.
Precisely!

Also bimodal distribution of probabilities of a member of a certain group having a certain predicate as their own.
We would, of course, not bother with phenotypes at all ourself, to be clear.
Fair.
No worries!  Being 28yo myself with a fam, kids, and job I more than understand.  Adulting is exhausting. Thank you!

P.S. my specialty is in human performance research, so I'm knee deep in peptides, prehormones, prohormones, and (especially) igf-1 every day.  Just trying to make everyone the biggest, strongest, fastest, smartest, and healthiest they can be.
Hey! 

Yes! I have a TON of articles saved. You have to be a WPATH member to access some of them....but that's what scihub is for! Are you familiar with it?

Also, I would love to collaborate/help/assist in ANY WAY possible. I think that we need people within our community advocating/educating people on the research. 

I can DM you the links tonight! Also, I can use my membership to look up any studies you may be interested in that I myself haven't looked into!
Thank youuu
Also I forgot to mention that for several predicates there's a bimodal probability distribution of such and such predicates having such and such probability of being the case in such and such category be it of gender (cause we're just going statistics and similar there's a probability distribution for cis women, trans women, women at large, enby women, non-enby women, intersex women, endosex women, pre-op trans women, post-op trans women, non-op trans women, trans women on HRT, cis women on T, pre everything trans women, and just any sort of set it's just statistics of probabilities not a statement of inevitable essence) - be it of gamic phenotype itself.
Ok, I'll look for some papers I can link tonight. No promises though because I'm absolutely slammed with work this week!
I'm going to look for some later tonight if I get time.
Thanks! I really like Forrest but I mustve missed this video.
I used a platform called web of science to gt my resources. Google scholar isn't bad though; it's my backup.  
So, the information I provided above is just common knowledge in wildlife biology about phenotypes. Any expert knows that phenotypes can change based on a variety of reasons. I simply applied that principle of the biological sciences to the sexual phenotype. I plan to find some resources soon though that I can provide for folks. Don't know if I'll have time during the week, but I'll try to get to it this weekend.
Whipping Girl is really good. And it was an important reading in my reflection as a lesbotransfeminist philosophy student and poet.
Sorry, I meant we don't concern ourselves with changing the mind of the bigot, but we do hope that other people who read the conversation might have their minds changed. Sorry for not being more clear.   


And, I would LOVE for being beautiful to be effortless for me haha!
What they're saying is that in a public argument there's the 2 people arguing and there's the are people watching and listening to the argument who maybe havent thought about it or are on the fence.
I'm not sure what WPATH is and why it's an issue but from what i gather we have a spy in the ""enemy""?
That's ok! I appreciate you!
Thanks for sharing!
'lesbotransfeminist' is the best word ever omgg <3
Not at all, you don't have to be sorry. It's often difficult to portray meaning in writing and part of the understanding is the responsibility of the interlocutor too.

I'm sure you are very beautiful. Have a good day.
Haha I love it!

WPATH is the World Professional Association of Transgender Health. Broadly, they are the organization which sets the medical standards for transition health care. They're the people who establish the criteria for puberty blockers, HRT, and surgery. When our providers are writing letters of support, it's WPATH's criteria they're using. 

This is the current standards of care: https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc

They're currently working on version 8. This is another reason I'm a WPATH member, I am able review the purposed changes and make sure that they're not harmful to our community. 

They're not an outright enemy, but they do reinforce medical gatekeepering.
UwU
I wasn't sure on the stance which is why I put it in the quotations. Thank you for clarifying! I think Ambassador would be a more accurate term but spy feels cooler. You're our spy on the inside hehe
I'm liasing quite a bit with PATHA in New Zealand as well as other medical people about guidelines and issues with inform consent which is in the soc 7 but some regions in New Zealand have ignored that and still want a psych assessment and endo appointment when a GP should be competent enough in the first instance, as for informed consent it would then also take any onus off the establishment and put it on the patient themselves giving them autonomy over their own care, 

Is the soc 8 going to get rid of the psych and endo assessment's or what's happening there?
Lmao!

I'm cool with spy!
Great question, I believe they recommend consult with a psych and/or endo for surgical procedures, but are moving more and more towards informed consent regarding puberty blockers and HRT. I'd have to double check. I last read it in December haha
I believe the informed consent has been around in WPATH since 2012 at least, I was given Spiro from birth to age 3 for diuretic purposes under the informed consent of my parents (felt good til age 7/8 when testosterone took over and menopausal symptoms started), 

Is good to read they are moving more and more toward informed consent, seems to be happening more and more here too, will take some strain off psychs and endos too which is a bonus (especially with public healthcare)"	weef9f	trans	1861	0.99	2022-08-02 15:19:37
MY FRIEND MADE THIS BRACELET FOR ME AND IM SO HAPPY I FEEL SO VALID OMG I FEEL LIKE A PRETTY GIRL		"i felt like this when my friend painted my nails for the first time :)))
quite poggers
That is so cute, how did they make the bracelet
I got the equivalent of a Rainbow bracelet of natural gems/crystals.
You are a very pretty girl
💛
Awwww omg its so freakng cuuuute
I love that bracelet! It's so cute!
Allsume love it
my other friend put make up on me and gave me some hair accesories, god did i feel pretty, i wish i could go out like that in public, or even in my house, its not safe for me to do that tho.
These have a pretty generic name unfortunately but they're known as friendship bracelets. They use embroidery floss. 

This one looks like it's 6 strings but based on how wide it is it could be more. This one is a Chevron pattern, which requires two different knots (there's usually only 4 types of knots in the patterns for these bracelets). Basically you have the string lined up next to one another and tie a simple knot over the string next to it, usually moving from left to right. In this case you would work half the strings to the right and the other half to the left, using a backwards version of the knot. You cycle through each string color until you get a desired length. I definitely recommend looking up a tutorial on YouTube. They're very simple to do but unfortunately pretty tedious, however they look amazing. 

Also sorry to kind of infodump, I hope some of this is useful though!
There are multiple videos online, all you need is string, scissors and patience lmao
aaaaaaaaa <33
Totally unrelated question:

Do you play Project Zomboid or is the username a coincidence?
Do you know what the style(?) of making it is called so it’s easier to look up a tutorial?
Ok thanks

I do not believe you’re 62…. You look incredible!!!!! 🏳️‍⚧️💕🏳️‍⚧️💕
everything on my life and soul u can't get me to believe ur a 62 year old! and WAS a man? I'm calling bullshit. u look hella younger and everything else.
your friend kind of looks like demi lovato / lh

that jean jacket looks great!
No amount of explanation could convince me that you're 62, goddamn you have aged like fine wine. Surely you mistyped 26
Whoa whoa whoa did you really start at 60?
Holy shit you look young and gorgeous
62?? You're *62yo??* You look *incredible!*

You remind me a lot of an Aussie model named Megan Gale -- she was in Mad Max: Fury Road.

Huge congrats on everything you've built and made happen for yourself, girl -- I hope you feel every bit as amazing as you look! 💖💖💖
62?????? You both are absolutely stunning. Could I have your skincare routine so I never age, too?
this is so wonderful and affirming to see,  thanks sweetie.
You’re stunning!
What drugs and supplements do you take?
wow you look 40
What the actual hell!! I hope i agr as amazing as you!! 🥰 you look freaking amazing! I was like obviously there is a 62 yr old women behind these two somewhere! Amazing 😍

also I think your friend looks like Demi lovato and it’s throwing me off
MtF 62yo? You look much younger! 😱
Excuse me madam there is no way in hell you are 62 years old pls stop lying.
Wow! Just wow!
So 60 is the new 20. God damn ladies you look gorgeous. Super cute and you look so happy OP.
You look like 40 or less. Beautiful
Wow you both look extremely and equally beautiful and like two beautiful cisters 😍
62? Are you kidding me? You look absolutely fantastic and very beautiful 😍
I am convinced HRT has made me an ageless witch. I have been asked at the same birthday party where my adult guardian was and which kid was mine. I'm 22.
I would be 3 …
That was my first thought !!  Holy shit, you look great.
Haha, that was my thought too. If i had hair like that it would be one less thing to worry about. It’s one of my biggest concerns about transition.
63 in Jan … yikes!
Woop enjoy
20 where u pull that from
No.., my friend is in her mid 30’s
Yeah… 20 is amazing! I’ve got 40 yrs on you! Go for it if it’s the right decision for you.?
Well, you must be gorgeous yourself!

After reading your comment, i would like to tell you that I wish you the very best outcome for what you will undergo 💖☺️
Seriously, it’s my surgeon Dr Toby Mayer and about 100k in work. But I’d trade places with that 30 yr old in a heart beat
Thanks gf 💋
Yes!
Yep. True… look at my profile, I have a few before and afters. 😘 makeup and great hair helps!
Thank you so much honey 🥰💕 ohhh yeah, I did see the movie but have to look up that actress 😘
Just morning and night… serums and moisturizer… makeup 💄 helps! My friend is late 30’s… couldn’t have come this far without her help!
Thanks 😊 😘😘😘
Thanks 🙏🏻😘😊🏳️‍⚧️
Haha! Cisters
You became a Sanderson sister, welcome to the family
I'd be 1. Back to childhood we go!
I'd be -3...
I’ve worn extensions since about 4 months in. As my hair grows out I get longer extensions, so my length is 16 inches.,
Every 20 year old female that I’ve seen looks pretty similar to her, not counting the hair length/color/texture and the skin tone
thanks! you're amazing
Well you pass very well for sure
You both actually do look like cisters
Back to trauma and abuse for me
U young lol

You look great,  I see you and many others like yourself that have just transformed into a butterfly and I hope that myself can manage even the slightest bit of that. If I can look half as good as you I would be immensely grateful.
Very cute
You like Lisa Loeb?

After two years avoiding it, France has eventually voted the law against conversion therapy. I'm so happy !		"Guess I'll move to France.
Damn, first Canada now France? We fucking lit lads
Excellent move France!
I still think that the inventor of conversion therapy coming out as gay is funny to me
Hell yeah!
Welp ik enough french to move to france.
Mais, si je parle français avec un accent terrible, puis-je emménager le même ?  M'aimez vous pareil ?
This is what Joan would've wanted/wants
Maybe next time they can vote to stop stealing resources from impoverished African nations. Bloody French bastards.
Wait, I can be myself there without any doctors permission?? Even srs?
Trans 🏳️‍⚧️ rights are human rights anywhere around the world 🌍
Can someone explain this? I’m trans and I kinda agree with seeing a therapist before starting hormones 

(Which is ironic cause I found a loop hole and did it without therapy with my school, but never the less….)
I hope this includes giving hormones to kids.
Canada officialy passed it today too
Meanwhile here due to religious people conversion therapy is going to be recommended for many people
I live in Ireland and I was shocked to learn CT is still legal over here. Hopefully we won't be too much longer banning it ourselves, but I'm not holding my breath
Same thing In canada! They are now illegal since yesterday ♡
I should have payed more attention during French at school.
Would be helpful to know some before moving to France.
France Ftw!
We actually have greats cares for trans people and almost for free. But wait for the next election cause right extremist have chance to pass
France horribly exploits African countries. Move somewhere else.
Please tell more
Bienvenue 😚
Nope, conversion therapy is torture to make lgbt people become cishet.

In France you're still need to see a psychiatrist to have the permission to be yourself and get ALD to have free care
Do you, know what conversation therapy is?
Conversion therapy is when people try to ""purify"" you and make you cis when you are of another spectrum
Oh you can start in english and learn french when you leave here
Especially [insert Z-word]
Some things in France are good....If you forget how gendered every single word is
...I'm moving from England
Oh ! Merci beaucoup ! 🥺
Ohh okayy, well here in the netherlands the system is fuckt so im going to move
clearly not lmao
Whoa, thanks!
Z-word?

Yeah that means that for example in France some people use feminine pronouns for a lamp but not for a trans woman


 YEP
Yeah but free hrt make me press the button lol
England has done horrible things in the past but France still extracts resources from it's African colonies in the modern day. England is still shit though, I would know, I'm native Australian. 

I personally plan on moving to Vietnam. It's not necessarily great with LGBTQ rights, but there isn't a high rate of hate crimes and from what I know, most people there don't care too much. Cost of living is low, the culture is nice and it's not an imperialist country.
Yeah HIM.
An asshole basically, aka Éric Zemmour, a bigger asshole than Marine Le Pen
Intelligence at its finest
My HRT is 8$, yeah its pretty much free
[removed]
Really I'm limited by the languages I can speak, which is just English and French (mostly).

So it's time to learn vietnamese I guess.
I'm canadian. I hace no odea who this is. I'm assiming he's a polititian?
Yeah
Yeah....
Canada seems to be a great country 😚
I'll join. Let's learn it
He is a polemicist who work on TV and write few books. He now runs for presidence. He's such an horrible personn who say racist sexist lgbtphobe thing all the time on TV. I think if he get elected I will be force to move out my country to continue HRT.

Politics in France goes right extremist since a few years because of impoverishment of working class and governement who systematically answer by force and blame imigration. Zemmour is not the only one but it's scary that he can say such horrible thing and media support him.
Yes and really humanly speaking he is horrible

I would have liked to make a comparison with a Canadian politician but i don't know a single one
Duolingo have it as a course...
Exactly i can't explain this better
He isn’t a racist just because he’s anti immigration,he just values culture. France is different than the USA in the sense it has a clear culture that has been there for thousands of years which is deteriorating due to immigration. To someone who values culture, his stances make sense
okay but what is this guy's actual name?
GOT IT
Yeah that's racist dude. And he is not only ""anti immigration""...
Éric zemmour
Probably more beneficial than the Klingon course I'm taking.
It isn’t racist to be anti-immigration.. no one says this about Arab and Africa nations. Saudi Arabia uae and African nations don’t accept too much  immigration since they want to preserve their culture, why can’t Europe do it too? It’s always the double standards.. but I expect to be downvoted anyways.. no one here has logic. Btw, I am not a support, but I simply dislike labeling him a racist just because he is anti immigration..
I just call him Mr Burns
He is not simply anti immigration WTF, he was condamned in the past for islamophobia.

And I don't understand why you came on a trans subreddit to defend Zemmour. Like even if he's not racist he say a lot of horribles things all the time
People do say the same thing about Arabic and African nations. What sort of rock do you live under? Its very well known which countries are xenophobic.
This guy's a troll. Goes to random subreddits and comments random bs. Checked its history."	rcliv9	trans	1754	0.98	2021-12-09 16:41:54

Wait your parents buy you things?

Wait you have parents???

oooohhhh!!! what kind did you get? i’ve been looking for tucking underwear for my girlfriend
I wonder how this conversation sounded 🤔





You: Mom pls I want Pocket PP Panty x2

Mom: ok


EDIT: Now when I read this I realized I sound like a five year old...
Could you perhaps share such a type of panties…. For cis reasons of course
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU, CONGRATS :D
Wow that is so lucky, wish I had them tbh I need then but wouldn't know how to ask for them
I ordered my first 2 pairs of panties recently, and my first pair of women's jeans. I cannot express how happy I am because of that. The items came today so that was convenient. Although I always go for alternative fashion (Killstar are epic), but I do use gaffs and/or body tape so whatever works. Congrats to you and I hope they'll make you happy. My mum is supportive too, so we all win here.
its great to see supportive parents, cant really relate but it shows that theres atleast still some good left in the world

in the meantime, i’ll be saving up those shopping websites for when i finally have my own place lol
Congratulations so jealous 🥰
That's amazing!! I hope they're as comfy as they are affirming. 🥰🥰
Your parents are amazing
Happy for you!!
It's posts like this that make me hopeful for the next generation despite all the terrible things I hear or see.

I'm really glad for you, and thank you for sharing with us!
Hey, that's great!! Your parents sound amazing too :)
Does it work like a gaff? 🐸
Im so happy for you :) I'm fr smiling in class rn
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wow!  Good for you!
i wish i was you  sister.
wait, THOSE TYPES OF PANTIES EXIST WAIT WHAT?!
This made smile, congrats!!!!!
I’m glad your parents except you and don’t question it, I wish you the best 💖
LETS GOO, I didnt know those existed thats cool
Do something nice for your parents. Let them know they are loved and appreciated.
Woah these exist! Um, where would one get these? Asking for a friend
that’s so cool!!!! congrats!!!!
i didnt even know those existed! Im so happy for you!! 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Wait inserts to hide? I need to know where to get these lol
Can you send me the link please I really need those
omg that is AMAZING!!! glad they accept you. alsooo what is the insert? i want to wear panties but i don’t want my femsicle slipping out yk
Wish my mother was as supportive. There wouldn't be any working it out woth her. Congrats on the new lingerie I hope its super comfy and sexy <3
Do you know where they got them!?
Lol congrats! Hope they fit well
That’s amazing I was shocked my mom just ordered them without me saying anything or anything and they are expensive
thanks. But they need 5 months to really accept it. But yet, I think everything is fine
All three of them 'Yes' 

I couldn't be luckier
At least the fist two things are also a new thing to me
Oof
https://www.trans-missie.com/en/slip-21.html

They have much of things like that. Theres nothing trans-related you don‘t find there. Even thinks like fake penises which you can pee with if you are FtM. Or silicone breasts and extra BHs (No idea if this is an english word or what the english word is so they are „breast holders“) with pockets to put them in. Also they have everything as a swimsuit option
check out leolines
There’s a listing of gaff underwear on Etsy, and one can find it made by trans designers - an excellent way to support trans designers.

I have a few pairs of it that I really appreciate. My wife bought them for me so I’m not sure the particular designers.
If you're in Europe I'd recommend Trans-Missie they have amazing elastic tucking panties which are very comfortable and hide everything very well, I also have a bikini bottom from them and it just looks so good and normal. From the US I heard LeoLines is supposed to be really good

For a moment I thought you were cursing because you were so mad about trying to find underwear, but then made a typo
It was very similar to it, to be honest. But I must say: My mom was the one who wanted to buy 2 because „Only one? Do you want to wear the same underwear every day?“
😭🤣
yeah this seems like an advertisement tbh.
I got this one but they have way more.

thanks
I mean, Just aks them like you want just new clothes. Don’t think to much about it
congratulations to you! supportive parents are the best
They are trying their best.
thanks
No problem! You cant imagine my smile after they ordered them
Thanks! Also only the best for you
Need me to send you some moths for them? They usually like to come by my house (/J)
That shouldn't be too hard to get. Stick a light outside your porch or window and you should get a few moths by the end of the week.
I love this… I’m going from female to male but I’m struggling. My parents are ""supportive"" but not. I don’t think they really want me to change. My mother made a comment earlier saying she doesn’t want me to do this for attention… what an assumption huh? I’m struggling at home
Same here!
can i just say that YOU ARE A FUCKING LEGEND FOR FINDING/SHARING THIS?
Thanks for posting this! I have a strapless strap-on that I am just not strong enough to hold in without support, and it is so hard to find something to work with it, and they have the perfect product!
I’ve got quite a few things from that seller! 100% recommend as well
Thank you! No one had recommended those before. Went and bought my first panties.
leolines aren't great if you're more well endowed. en femme gaffs work much better.
[en femme is another good option, especially if you're a bit bigger.. down there ](https://enfemmestyle.com/collections/gaffs)
How do they work? They look like regular panties so I cant tell lmao
Yup, that's total Mom energy. Good on you for having that support. 💕
i’m joking around since you said moths instead of months btw so ye
I hope they come along faster than 5 months for you🖤
Yes and thanks. I know also a other website but it has only MtF things: https://www.shop-transgender.de

"The german ""Selbstbestimmungsgesetz"" (Self ID Law)"	"The last day of pride month the german government revealed their plans for the upcoming self ID law, after 40 years without changes:

-Removal of assessments, people can now simply file a change and get it 

-Deadnaming will be a punishable offense

-Forced outing will be punishable even for private persons

I liked is that they reaffirmed in response to T*RF questions that trans women are women and also the statement that the supposed debate about trans people is already settled in the medical world. 

It's a start and I am very happy about it!😍 🏳️‍⚧️"	"YOU FORGOT THE BEST PART!!! Starting at age 14 you can do it on your own and if your lega guardians disagree with it you can get the German version of cps to ""replace your parents""(this is a quote and I find it hella funny) after an application of the child!!!
\- Deadnaming will be a punishable offense  
For who? The people or the government?
Germany is fucking legendary… cheers… now THAT’S what i call freedom

Not whatever the fuck america’s doin
I miss Germany! Years ago as a young teen. I’m so happy for you.
I already know basic German from highschool. Think I may need to polish it up and flee my country soon...
F*ck the US, I'm moving to Germany
adding it to my list of places to live in a few years.
omw to Germany
Einfach genial! Can Germany pick up the torch for research into uterine transplants for trans women? I have a feeling if German surgeons picked it up and joined the Swedish and Indian surgeons we could have a solution in single years instead of decades.
Nice
But you'll still need to get 2 therapist to analyse you and shit to medically transition :/
maybe all hope isn’t lost just yet
As a german person I absolutely love this.
Do you have a link to an article or something?
So first of all, it's not coming until mid 2023. If at all, knowing our government.

And it doesn't include much needed improvements to medical access as was promised and as was included in the old proposals from the greens and FDP. The fucking terfs at the SPD made them compromise on this. 

It's a disappointment.

https://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=42474
Well, if the USA completely goes to shit, Germany, here I come
Despite Germany being controversial in world history it is ahead of America can we just appreciate that for a second
I love Germany even more now
I am SO glad for some good news for once.
I need to up my Duolingo game, because if our government doesn't do stuff in the foreseeable future, I might be migrating.
Do you have a link to the debate or wherever they answered the questions/suggested the law?
I hope they implement it soon..
Lets fucking gooooooo (to germany)
That's it, Germany here I come!
Where in Germany can an aspiring trans film maker get work and be safe and survive knowing no German except ""eggs taste good"" 😂
Finally! I still remember how the Judge basically just chatted a little with me when I had my court appointment, because to her I look like a woman and sound like a woman and that's that.
Sounds like I need to brush up on my German...
I think they need to ad a couple more letters to that word
***SOMEBODY CALL UP A PLANE, I'M PACKING MY BAGS***
I've been on a high ever since they announced it 😊
I FUCKING LOVE GERMANY I AM going to move there as soon as I turn 18 and can get the fuck out of America and away from my mostly shitty family
Aaay go Germany!
I'm visiting Germany rn and that's why I love this country! BERLIN IS MY CITY! ICH BIN BERLINER!!!
Dude I gotta move to germany
I'll be keeping Germany in my mind for when I finish my computer science degree here in the US 👀
criminalisation of private conversations and interactions is fucking terrifying. this is not the way to go.
Fuck that's awesome, but with a word that long you knew it had to be awesome. I love the German language :P
the mentioned points are outlines of the law, wich fill be finished in the next months and will be official in about a year.
A law for easier access to medical transitioning will follow during the next years too.
Germany is finally going a few steps forward, now that the Conservative party is out of government!
does the removal of assessments apply to hrt and surgeries?
That sounds wonderful!
While America goes backwards…
That's extremely based.
I hope it passes this time 🙏. The SPD (Social democrats) wouldn't pass it the last time. 

The current law is in desperate need of overhual.
Feels weird to say, but the Germans are getting it right..
This made me cry I love German people so much it’s so wonderful to see good news when there is so much bad in the us
Okay but punishing people who deadname? It’s taken my friends and especially relatives a while to get used to my chosen name for example, so I think there should be some limitations there
Working adjacent to the german cps - it aint that easy, replacing parents is the very last measure we are legally allowed to take. Gotta try fixing it first, aka talking to parents and helping them understand. Only if there is child endangerment going on (which it also is if parents refuse to change problematic behaviour in their parenting) can we take kids away. 


Unless you mean cps consent replaces parental consent for this procedure only. Then it might be very much different, depending on how the law is worded.
[removed]
It counts as infringement of your privacy. If you are considered openly trans, i.e. you were a public figure before transitioning then it is okay for newspaper to mention your deadname so people know who actually tranistioned. Otherwise, if someone would out you to people who don't know, or the General public, that would be punishable. Its probably a bit like publishing photos of the inside of the home of somebody, in a paper, without their consent. (In terms of legal things)
They said that it's only punishavle if you don't have the infotmation from public sources.

So no, deadnaming by random people, who happen to know your deadname, will not be punishable.

It's about the people who work with the government and have access to the documents, where your name change is listed (i think this extends to everyone who has access to these documents). If they out you, that would be an offense.

But i'm not getting my hopes as high. It was just a plan with no duty to follow up on it. The law-writing-process didn't even begin yet. So we'll see if there will be anything at all, and if yes, how the law will look at that point...
It's probably gonna be similar to insults but I'm not sure
Eh, I highly doubt that this will actually happen.


Last time they promised similar nice things and what did they try in the end?
Make the trans person's fucking SPOUSE testify in court.
Never specified how that will impact the decision of gender marker change, just that the spouse will be asked to testify.


Caused huge outrage and they pulled it back.

So yeah, I don't think this is going to happen.




Hell, even legalization of cannabis, while everywhere in the news, is still on very unstable legs.
CDU just needs to get a tad more power and they will throw it out of the window, despite nearly all of Germany supporting it.


Fuck I despise these Christian conservative fuckers.
I'm living in Germany and it's not that great. Still better than the usa right now, i guess, but fascism is rising fast here as well. So let's see how the future goes...
Americas a nursery in comparison to the burj Khalifa which is germany
what america is doing is called fascism ~ the oppression of individual freedoms combined with ultra-militarism/ultra-nationalism
Same.
I heard the earliest it'll be an active law is the start of 2023, take your time lol
Its not passed
We were the leading nation in transgender issues once, we can do it again, I'll believe in it!
Germany does research into uterine transplants already, but that really doesn't help trans women as of yet. The problem isn't the uterus, it's synthesising the complex hormones needed for a full cycle as well as pregnancy.

And so far, ovaries aren't reusable.

Plus, transplanted people are *extremely* immunocompromised. 

I wish that uterine transplants would be the viable next step for trans women becoming biological, child carrying mothers, but I really don't think it is. First we need to find a way to improve HRT to a point that a uterus would be useful.
It ain't gonna happen ever.

It's theoretically possible, but every type of organ transplant requires immuno suppressants.

People are already fighting back against hormones due to side effects and such, society would never allow a surgery like that if it means being reliant on immuno suppressants for the rest of your life.
And most organ implants still get rejected a decade or so later so it is a super dangerous surgery too, even years after it's healed. 

It's a nice dream for sure but I don't think it's gonna be reality :<
Apparently they said that Lauterbach is working to reform that
No, you don't. You need a mandatory number of therapy sessions (differs for what you want; it's 12 for HRT and minor surgeries) and then a single letter (the Indikationsschreiben) from a single therapist of your choosing.

The 2 specialist thing and court sessions is only for changing your name and/or sexmarker in your documents and the very law that this thread is about aims to get rid of that.
Here's a brief one. There's surprisingly little about it in the newspapers so far. https://www.dw.com/en/germany-unveils-plans-for-simpler-legal-gender-change-process/a-62315345

You get by in most of europe with english, and over time you'll learn more than ""eggs taste good"". Just what city you need to ask a german about, but I'm guessing Berlin isn't such a bad bet.
We are pros in long weird words xD
Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz
(it means Beef Labelling Monitoring Task Transfer Act)
Yesssss!
Welcome to Germany!
It's also not remotely what's proposed here, but go off i guess.
I wasn't sure if it's the right thing to post it right now. But now I kbow it was a good idea!
It will only be punishable if it's done on purpose, not when people slip up unintentionally.
In the courts the child welfare has the highest priority so even if the parents are against it, the child can get a name change. Although i am not entirely sure how this process is and what steps the kid might go through. But it's long in practice to have the child welfare as first priority no matter the case.
this just rubs off the wrong way
[deleted]
That was 90 years ago and this is not a good way to speak of those times.
It's about privacy.


With the transgender law (TSG) as it is right now, legally most places are required to terminate data revealing your past.

""Offenbarung Verbot"" Meaning ""Prohibition of revealing""
Your status as transgender is protected by law.
No one is allowed to see that data anywhere, unless very very necessary.
Even your workplace has to delete any files that can be accessed.
Files that are stored internally and never used don't apply though.
This law doesn't need to go through the Bundesrat. That means only our current government can and will decide about it. 
It's also not just a promise anymore. They showed us the key points of the actual law in work and it will be ready for debate after summer break.
They even said that it will be official early to mid 2023. That is way more than an empty promise. 
And in that time frame the CDU can't possibly gain the power to stop it.
At least we have a democracy lul
Oof

I wish u luck
As a German 

Germany is pretty old school in that regard. We have a law that is proven multiple times to go against human dignity (first article of our constitution) 
Yet somehow is still in place.

One of the party's involved in the new law promised it last legislature as well and then voted against it. 

It also is not set in stone that the law is coming. And if it does it comes in about a year. 

Germany is really not that progressive. 

There are many EU states who have these kind of laws for years

Edit: got words with different meanings mixed up
Would the udssr count as fascistic by that definition?
Maybe Autumn 2022, we have to wait
..
I mean that sounds a long time until you realize that is like half a year which is what you will need to properly come here anyways. 

Starting hrt is still a lottery tho.
Yes, I'd have to be on immunosuppressants. I'm also aware that I'd have a very limited time with it. I just want to have one child. Just one and then they can take it back. 

There's one doctor in India that's going to do the procedure on a trans woman soon, and iirc one in South America. American society will never be ready for it- the only comments I've seen from random Americans is talk of flying to India to assassinate the doctor and patient. 

An American surgeon though did recently write an article talking about how a trans man giving up *all* of their reproductive system could be the solution, and due to many underlying factors could create a surgery with a much higher chance of success. There's also a scientific technique called decellularization which has already shown success in (30k ft version) overwriting the genetic signature of the donor with that of the host, making the donor tissue biocompatible. These two things together would be the way forward, but we're not there yet. 

In the meantime, I understand that there's a high risk of death, either by rejection or by freedom loving Americans, but the pain that this has caused me since I was a teen and still causes me to this day makes the risks to my life and never being able to return to the US are worth it for me. I don't want to be infertile, I want to at least have a chance.
Uterine transplants have already been done several times, idk what you're on about. They just don't work for trans women because of the hormonal situation, but cis women who didn't have an uterus for whatever reason have received transplants and carried children to term with them.
I hope something will come out of this.
Didn't knew that, thanks for telling.
[deleted]
I mean one can hope they're properly going through the law text until they publish something but oh well...
Idek what those words mean together in English
Alrighty, that’s good then c:
Eh, I've said it before and I'll say it again. You'll never find a more reliable ally than an enemy whos seen the error of their ways.
Well... Wow!
Genuinely confused about what I said that’s offensive. They have a legal route for the children to “replace your parents” that doesn’t sound like the CPS nightmare the US has. This is after they are allowed to start hormonal therapy without parental permission. That sounds like it provides autonomy for the children to be accountable for their future. 

Seriously, what’s the low blow here? Unless it seriously is just the joke about “Germany used to be the baddies.”
I’m still really confused about how this was offensive to most people on the sub, and I genuinely am trying to understand.

The first statement was genuine. I really do mean that they offer an unparalleled level of autonomy to people under 16-18, especially the trans community now.

The second statement was a joke about how Germany has come so far from Nazism in comparison to the US going backwards towards fascism, nationalism, and theocracy, *especially in the trans community now.*

I really hope someone can bring it to light how I’m being ignorant and I can actually grow from this, but I really don’t understand how that could’ve been misconstrued.
I might need to start a go fund me for my transition and moving to Germany
Very much hope you are right. The process I went through was real shit 🤷‍♀️


Hope they don't remove the offenbarungsgesetz though. That needs to stay.
Don't really see, why that's a good thing...
This is not the First amendment but rather the first Article of the Constitution. An amendment is something that is added afterwards.
Still sounds better then America
How many? I know of Denmark, Belgium, Malta, Ireland and Portugal. Norway and switzerland also have em but arent EU. 

Thats 5/27 EU nations which is decent, but not a lot. I am genuinely curious if I am missing some.

E: 6/27 actually, I remebered Luxembourg.
It's worth adding that getting an abortion is still a criminal act in Germany. This law is a step in the right direction, but the country still lags behind in many ways and the religious lobby has considerable power. There's no room for complacency anywhere.
6-9 months until it goes to the ministers and the some more time until it goes to the parliament... Summer 2023 is what they communicated
They've said mid 2023.
Fucking same in Finland, with covid everything got fucked. Takes a year and a half at the earliest to start HRT, and my appointments keep fucking getting pushed back double the time
My main point wasn't about it being impossible, but about it not being done due to the huge health risks and costs.


Uterine transplants require life long immune suppressants.



With transgender Healthcare, people claim they balance benefit and risk, and thus try to make many things not available.



Since trans women have been able to live without an uterus for decades, I don't think they will make it available.


Maybe in some non western countries like Thailand, for some good amounts of money.



Well there is also the issue of not many uterus being available.
I can do you one better; here is a very helpful site for all things trans: https://transmann.de

Here's their info on therapy stuff:
https://transmann.de/trans-informationen/medizinisches/therapie-gutachten/

Here's a list with therapists and doctors (probably not 100% up to date, but still better than blind googling):
https://transmann.de/adressen/

They also have a helpline.
The draft law is only going to be published in September at earliest, this is an ""Eckpunktepapier"", a statement of the intended content
I am very sorry,
It's a long bs word, which is used for a meat packaging control law... Its hilarious.
Joking about such things = not OK.

At least as a german thats my best guess.
Thanks for the correction
At least you got informed consent HRT clinics
Ok fewer than I remembered
Still Germany is not that progressive
Sweden i guess?
That's true on paper, but abortion law is also swamped by a bunch of technicalities

Pre-12 week abortions are always allowed, after 12 weeks you need sufficient enough reason, and since it also includes ""significant threat to the physical **or mental** health"", you can chalk up a lot of things under that mental health part, and you need a counselling session 3 days before the abortion.

Realistically, I have not heard from someone who wasn't able to have an abortion, but it's very possible that it does happen, I wouldn't know

A law that didn't allow for ""advertisement"" of abortion by doctors was also repealed in Germany, the same day Roe v Wade was overturned, coincidentally. It means doctors are actually allowed to inform about abortions now, and inform if they offer it as a healthcare service, which previously wasn't allowed either since that would count as ""advertising"".
Getting an abortion is ""illegal"", meaning you can get one if you fulfill certain conditions. The conditions are that you have to ask for it, you have to talk with some guys that yes, you understand what you're doing and get some document from them, a licensed doctor has to do the abortion and the pregnancy has to be before it's 14th week. I'm not sure what happens during the talks so idk if they try to convince you to keep the baby or really just inform you about abortion, but otherwise the conditions sound fairly reasonable to me.
The transplants aren't for LIFE, though. They're transplanted, then you need a few successful cycles, and then they last the pregnancy and get taken out after.

They are only done for people with an extreme wish for biological children, and usually require a donation from your own mum.

They're not done for any other purpose. 

And they wouldn't do shit for trans women because HRT isn't there yet. HRT can't simulate pregnancy hormones. Yet, at least.

The risks outweigh the benefits anyway, for most people, so it'll stay rare.
As someone in Germany with a shaky German at best, do you have any idea how easy/difficult it is to find a therapist speaking English for the required sessions to start HRT?
Wellll, yeah, then our government might be there but the news outlets still don't wan to publish on our issues
Yeah, but I’m requesting an answer from the trans community rather than the German community. It’s clear that y’all have done leaps and bounds. I could understand the response if it’s the “baddies” joke if this were a German subreddit, but I just don’t see how it was in **such** bad taste according to the people of the sub. 

Yes, I might have a very dark sense of humor, but like I feel like this response is strictly from this community and would be accepted elsewhere. 

This community is very small. I have a job working with all kinds of people in a public space, yet not large enough that I interact with members of the trans community on even a bi-monthly basis. 

Really I just want to know what exactly I said was offensive, why, and so I can use it to not offend someone in the future. So far 40+ people have felt the need to downvote and not a single one expand on why it’s negative to the trans community. 

Children only learn when you tell them why they do or don’t do something, not when you say “because I said so.”
Should have made that clear, I don't live in America but I have close friends who do so I'm usually made aware of what goes on. I live in the UK
More progressive on this particular subject than 20 or so other countries. I see what you're saying, but it's important that a 'not very progressive' country seems to be becoming moreso.
Oh no definitely not. 

However I am realizung a shift in tone regarding this issue with many of the 40-60 year old conservatives I work with.
Abortions before twelve weeks and after an array of meetings are not punishable, but still technically illegal. This is the result of a compromise with the Christian right following reunification, and for the former GDR this is worse than what they had before. The overall point I was making is that progress shouldn't be taken for granted on either side of the Atlantic.
It's still a criminal act, but is not punishable if a range of conditions are met. Until very recently, it was also illegal for doctors to advertise (""promote"") abortions.

In practice, it's the usual German thing of making people jump through unnecessary bureaucratic hoops. But the criminalisation of abortion in Eastern Germany and the cancellation of the Roe v Wade ruling in the US show us that progress is not something that can be taken for granted, it has to be fought for. That was my point.
Eh, I assume the science is there, we just need human trials. 


Implants that release very specific amounts of drug into the system are a thing.

We have drugs for e1, drugs for e2, drugs to control SHGB levels, drugs to control prolactin levels, drugs to control progesterone levels. We can control Fsh and lh, but how are we going to get there without trying is the question.



Although you are right, I did not think about using it for pregnancy only.
I would only do such a surgery for a permanent effect in my case.
Doesn't even matter if I'll still be infertile, I just want the tools x')
No, you'd have to call around and ask, i'm afraid.
I searched for an article but was surprised at the lack of major newspapers. Maybe I jumped the gun though - like someone else said, the summary was only published on Thursday and there are opinion pieces out there, only behind paywalls.
Depends on the paper. I read an article where 3 activists discussed this law and even found a trans man who was very much opposed to this law (1 of the three). Forgot names tho, sorry.
I can think of a couple reasons...

- There are some things that shouldn't be joked about, and this is one of them.

- It could be triggering for some people

- ~~Some~~ A lot of people feel that we're headed back to dark days and just don't want that reminder in their face.

- It's old and trite. Will EVERYTHING good that EVER happens there reference their past?

- Several people have reported this comment, so it's not just me.
Finally, thank you. Don’t remove, please leave it all up in case anyone comes across. 

I won’t answer to your points even though I disagree with some of the opinion. I made this chain with open mindedness, rather than to promote any kind of dissent."	vpkf8v	trans	1728	0.97	2022-07-02 05:26:53
my post was immediately taken down on a Christian subreddit	"hi so im trans and Christian, and I genuinely wanted to talk to other Christians and explain my experiences. I spent several hours crafting this long post explaining why I am the way that i am, and different scriptures I think help support the existence of trans individuals. i read through the subreddit's rules twice before i posted this, and almost immediately it was taken down. people just don't want to hear it and they don't want to learn. my post was not even considered to be kept up by the mods. it felt almost like the word ""transgender"" is a ban word on a bot, and it immediately deletes any post with that word. I'm so sick of this mistreatment from a community im supposed to love and be getting support from. i spent hours carefully crafting this post to make sure i said everything i wanted to say, exaclty how i wanted to say it. making sure what i was saying was not offending and encouraging of questions and discussion from people who just genuinely didnt understand. i even linked resources i used to come to different conclusions. i tried so hard to be heard and listened to and im so incredibly disappointed right now. anyways, this is just a vent because im just so tired to not getting to voice my story and experiences as a trans christian. id be happy to post that post here though if you guys would be interested in hearing it. i probably wont, but the offer is there i guess. im just so sick of everything."	" That makes me so upset. 

I had a talk like this with my mom the other night and she effectively said “I don’t care who you are so long as you respect my religion around me” basically saying don’t bad mouth god and she went on to tell me she loves everyone and would never turn anyone away no matter what they may be. My grandmother was the exact same way, when she found out I was friends with a transgender person (before I came out) she told me “you be good to him (ftm guy) because this world is hurtful and I know you  well enough to treat him good” 

Christians are supposed to be like that. Like my mom and grandma, loving people, there are so many who really are that way but unfortunately they aren’t spoken very loudly.  

I’m sorry that happened to you :(
Check out r/TransChristianity

Edit: and check out this trans theologian’s work: [Austen Hartke](http://austenhartke.com/)
I don't know which subreddit it was, but yeah that sucks.

Check out r/OpenChristian, r/TransChristianity, and r/GayChristians, if you haven't already.

For the record, r/Christianity is a mixed bag in my experience and r/TrueChristian is super toxic.

Please know that you are loved and supported. As a fellow trans Christian, please also know that you are not alone.

Edit: Also, for what it is worth, I'd love to see what you wrote, if you still have it. I spend a lot of time here on Reddit advocating for trans inclusion in the church and supporting other LGBT+ Christians. So, I'd love to see any resources you might have!
No it’s ok. You’re are absolutely right to feel the way you do and if you’re religion is important to you, no one can suggest otherwise. Keep being yourself and follow your convictions regardless of what others think. Not Christian btw but everyone is entitled to their beliefs and to be free from discrimination. Maybe one day will live in such an open society :)
Reddit mods are a bunch of wannabe HOA presidents.
I’d be interested in reading your post. I’m trans and Christian and this has been an area of struggling for me.
Honestly, you don't need em anyway. There are better communities for you to be a part of, such as the Christian trans sub.

Unfortunately, like all major establishments, the bulk of Christianity will take issue with you. For religion, it's not just a science or logic thing or whatever, it's also a moral thing. You simply won't be getting many people to agree with you as long as you're trans. 

This is why we fight. Not because we want to, but because we are forced to. Sorry you're seeing this happen within your community. It's a cruel lesson to learn that we're hardly accepted anywhere.

Surround yourself with good people, rather than arguing with bigots. I promise it'll be a better use of your time.
The people your dealing with are so brainwashed. I'm former Christian conservative that left the religion and the party about the time trump was elected. The Christianity I grew up with is now considered socialism. I'm gen x and my generation just flat out gave up on trying to change things. You'll never get through to them or change their minds. It's terrible to say this but once the boomer generation and the later half of my generation retire shut up or pass on things will change for the better. Don't give up. Millennials and gen z are going to change the world. Sorry for punctuation I'm stoned.. but I really wanted to tell you from my personal experience that your voices will be heard. But trying to change someone's dumb ignorant opinion is futile.
here is a google doc i made of my post. it has everything word for word as the original porst that got taken down for anyone who wants to read it.

I'm sorry you have to keep dealing with this, I'm non-religious myself, so I can only imagine the disappointment and isolation you must feel. I don't like saying it, but the reputation isn't unearned, and is why a lot of us non-christian trans people do our best to avoid those spaces. That said, there's already a lot of posts here pointing you to the new subreddit, I think you'll find a lot of what you're looking for there, both for faithful and trans support. Best wishes to you in your journey!
I'm a trans Christian too and unfortunately most people who label themselves as Christian are honestly worse about handling faith than just about anyone. The more pious and in your face someone is with their Christianity, the less they act as Jesus teaches. Just a shitload of Bible-thumping and hate-spewing.

Jesus taught love, acceptance, and kindness to others, NOT using what should be good and constructive (religion) as a weapon to destroy the lives of innocents. Coming from a trans woman raised very, very close to the Bible Belt. The people on that sub are ""Christians,"" not real believers. If they were, they'd show at least the most basic decency and listen to you before the ban.

From one transgender Christian to another, you are seen and you are loved. Jesus sides with those who show acceptance and care, not those who continue to try and drive wedges between people and cause pain. Stay strong, friend. You have my respect for trying so hard to teach others we're not bad and for trying to bridge the gaps of understanding.
Also a Christian here, I just genuinely don't want anything to do with anyone of my religion that doesn't understand it or at least tries to... Everyone I met was offensive, disrespectful, uninterested and genuinely said I am an incarnation of a sin.

So for me I just follow my beliefs totally excluding myself from any church. The only person who is sorta religious and understands me is my boyfriend and that's it.
I’m sorry you faced this. It’s not right.

You deserve to have your beliefs and practice them free of bigotry.

I would remind you that Christianity is not a monolith, every individual community is going to be different. There are trans-celebrating Christian groups out there.

I wish I had some to offer, but my wife and I are Jewish atheists 😋
I’m a Christian as well sister! Sad to say, the same religious groups that are rejecting LGBT+ HUMAN BEINGS, are the same religious groups who would brutalize groups of color, and them tell them that Jesus loved them. Jesus DOES LOVE YOU, ME, AND ALL OF US! Hatred, alienation and rejection often clothes itself with a cross around its neck.

Yeah most ""Christians"" aren't actual Christians. They just take the title to make themselves seem better than they really are.
I'm sure there are many other trans Christians who are experiencing the same thing, it's disgusting how people are so quick to dismiss others.
The worst christians are the christians, a sentance I already hear. It mean that a lot of christians don't actually follow what the Holy Bible say, like love and respect your neightboor and things like that. God is love and love you my brother
Hey, I’m a graduate student studying the intersection of religion/spirituality and transgender identity! I just want to say that you are absolutely right that religious belief is stigmatized within the queer/trans community (of course queerness is also stigmatized within mainstream Christianity and other religions) and you aren’t alone in trying to think through this. I’d love to see the post you wrote and how you interpret scripture to affirm your trans self if you’re willing to share it via DM or direct me to another place where you’ve posted it!
I would love to talk to you of you want i am also Christian. If you want a subs with some pretty out there views on Christianity but also doesn't take down trans stuff here https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share just warning is can get bad sometimes like the other day i debated with people who felt that it was Biblical to treat their wives like dogs.
If you want more affirming ones here you go the is two for you https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenChristian?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Hope you enjoy and feel free to dm
It's a shame that a good percentage of Christians must make Jesus wonder why he ever even bothered.
Former christian here, their support and acceptance will always be performative, always teetering on the edge and will fall off the cliff on the slightest offense. Never will a christian practice the teachings of the bible.  Their whole religion is built on man made lies.  How any reasonable rational, clear minded secure person could be a christian baffles me.
Definitely look into different types of churches. Some of the newer churches specifically state that they accept the LGBT community. That way u can have a community of ppl that accept you that you can talk to about things.
Sounds like one of the most stupid things done by your own community. I really don't get why people think you can't be lgbtq+ and christian or religious in general. Like yeah there are christians who want to treat lgbtq+ people badly but that doesn't mean all of them do. Hope you get the recognition you deserve, OP.
Im in the same boat as a trans Christian  since my Christianity is very different from a conservative fundamentalist's. I protest on campus with a trans flag with a cross on it and people think in trying to be deliberately inflammatory, I'm just trying to be genuine. If you want to talk about ideas between transgender and Christianity go ahead and message me since I mostly just explain myself to people who don't understand the concept.
I'm really sorry if this sounds harsh, but being a person outside of the norm doesn't usually mesh with religious communities. The post you made sounds like the internet equivalent of going to a community church event and trying to discuss trans issues with random people.

You can find plenty of Christian communities that specifically say they are LGBTQ positive, though, so seek those out, and don't give up!! I'm sure you'll find your people :)
as a satanist, here's some advice. if they don't respect you, get better friends.
Have you tried r/radicalchristianity ? I saw that it's a little more inclusive. If youswant to talk about queerness it might not get taken down there.
I was raised in the “church”. I saw the hypocrisy. Now I’m 40. I no longer go to church. I want to watch the “church” be brought to justice and then destroyed for the betterment of mankind.
I'm sorry to hear this, though I'm not surprised. I hope you can find what you need in that community.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V0u3nEsmJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V0u3nEsmJI)

pretty much sums it up
No shit.
Tbh, this is the reason I left the church I grew up in. I still believe most of the same things, but I just can't stand the majority of christian circles
I’m sorry this happened to you. It really irritates me how some Christians cherry pick verses from the bible to be really strict about, then totally let other verses go. I seriously doubt most people who believe trans people shouldn’t exist because of what the Bible says are strictly adhering to biblical advice about diet and dress. They’re just using the Bible as a front for their own hang ups and discomfort. Love to you from Michigan.
But to think about it… they are supposed to love you. 

You can see the difference between the espoused beliefs and their true behaviors
I gave up on Christianity when I was 11 at the hands of the Catholic Church.  You can probably guess why.  So I can only give my perspective as someone that wants nothing to do with religion.

My experience has been many Christians have an agenda that supersedes the true intent of their faith.  These people cannot be reasoned with.  They will force their dogma on everyone they can.  You don't have to look far to see this happening in the US.

If you are looking for Christians that will listen, you'll need to find another sub that's more open.  Or take your message to another support site.  I know they are trans Christian support sites and blogs out there.  You could also spin up a blog of your own and start promoting it on various social media.

The other possibility is to reconsider the message you want to convey.  Instead of trying to convince skeptics with words, convince them with actions.  Walk your talk, as they say.  People will notice and realize you aren't a threat.
Christian has almost become a 4 letter word.
This attitude, common among the religious, is one of the reasons I no longer call myself a Christian. 

If you are looking for a Christian church that accepts trans people, I was told that the Evengelical Lutheran Church in Canada has a program to minister to the unique needs of the trans person. But, I haven't experienced it first hand yet.
I mean, religions are reactionary in nature and it's no surprise that many christans are bigots who are against trans people. There's not much you can do, honestly 🤷🏻‍♀️
Religion is a fool's errand. I can promise you, the silly little scholars that wrote the bible would not be accepting of you. Just give up religion, the shit's stupid anyway.
This is part of a larger narrative of why I simply don't like religion in general.

A lot of people use religion as a ""get out of jail free"" card for their bigotry/ignorance/lack of moral fiber, anything they don't like is immediately disregarded and any arguments to the opposite are considered a personal attack by them.

I used to be confused as to why trans people support Christianity and its many sects, and I still am to a point.

Don't get me wrong, if someone is religious and trans, I wish you the best of luck and happiness, and I'll never attack you personally for it, I just don't get it. 

So yeah, I'm always up for hearing people's justifications for being trans AND Christian, because my opinion is that it's hard to justify, not impossible, just difficult. 

I've argued with trans Christians in the past due to my own short sightedness on the issue, and partly due to my own intense dislike for religion, and especially Christianity, because of people's propensity to use it as an excuse to do harm.
With all due respect, coming from an ex Christian, they can be so incredibly toxic and it’s likely that the majority is going to be bigoted
Sadly, this doesn't surprise me at all. With the greatest of respect to yourself, Christians have persecuted minorities for centuries. Until eventually their opinions become so unwelcome that they have to reform their own beliefs to reflect a more 'modern' perspective... It's happened throughout history since the birth of Christianity.

For what it's worth, I was a Christian too at one time. But I can't abide by their hypocrisy I'm afraid.
My grandma is Christian and that’s the only reason I haven’t come out. They’re all the same. She loves her grandchildren, but to hear her say “I love gays and transgender people! But as long as they’re not my grandchildren.” about a year before I actually made the decision (I changed my pronouns to he/him yesterday so I’m relatively new to the community, but I have 2 other FTM school friends I’m hanging out with) is just absolutely absurd. It’s not “disobeying god” if you don’t want to be who you are anymore. My family supports LGBTQ+, but the REASON I’m only coming out TO OTHER KIDS and NOT MY OWN FAMILY is because if grandma knew, she would be angry. She might not exactly HATE me, but she’ll definitely lose trust in me.
Yeah, sadly I'm not surprised. You may have better chances for a fruit bearing discussion on a sub that isn't labeled ""christian"" (or any other *phobic religion) but rather something more theological/ethical/philosophical, meaning people actually working with the scripture instead of only using religion as a power fix or for easy answers.

As an atheist myself I do find organized religion mostly embarrassing, not necessarily the people believing in whatever god(s) they want, but the organisations itself.
We just had some great coming-out from people inside the church here in the country and it's shocking that the church as the only employer has the right to take a dump on equality laws and replace them. If they do, I hope the current trend of people quitting their membership getting even faster (though it's possible it goes unnoticed as there are already more people quitting each day than the bureaucracy can handle).
I am really sorry to heard that but you are absolutely right. Christians are so post to be loving of all people and welcoming. 

I was raised Christian and my family and school friends were all Christian, I went to a Christian school btw. When I came out as trans, I could no longer goto my church and I lost all my friends that were religious. It took some time for my parents to come around but they are more of the ""love everyone"" Christians, they just didn't understand why I am trans. Unfortunately this is a somewhat common experience for lgbtq+ people in religious communities. I'm not saying its impossible to exist in a Christian community and be trans but it will most likely be difficult and full of experiences where people don't want to learn or listen.

I wish you good luck and I think you are very strong to be able to keep believing in Christianity through all of this.
I'm not trans but I grew up in the southern US with family dyed in the blood of the lamb and all that good stuff. Leaving all that behind has never been anything but a positive experience for me.
Please do post it here. I don’t think it’s fair to remove a post as Christians should be able to share their thoughts freely and decide for themselves what to integrate into their own perspectives.

I’m also genuinely curious about the verses in support of transgenderism as I’ve only read on the topic in relation to the demons (e.g., Baphomet).
U know the bible hates everyone whos not straight?
I’ve heard r/radicalChristianity is a welcoming sub? idk from experience
I'm sorry that happened. I would be happy to read it
As a fairly religious Christian & has a trans partner who is not Christian or even religious. I support him. Whether or not he believes. I do also ask that he respect me and my belief in Christ. I’m here to talk with OP. I was not put on this earth to judge so I try my best not to. So sorry to hear about those other people.
F\*\*\*ing Christians! Exactly why I hate them and their God of Abraham!
Ahh it's so sad reading this. Not because they are not accepting, why would you think otherwise, but because you're christian
Don’t be mad only creates bitterness I’m not on the whole religion train it’s a relationship with the father a lot of the Christian people and church won’t be excepting and myself I’m ok with that totally there right
Christian mom here with a trans teenager. It makes me so angry when people use my faith to judge and malign people they consider “other”. 

Whoever you are, you are sacred. Don’t let anyone take that from you.
I could see them blanket banning it because of a bunch of bigots constantly shitting on trans people, so if anything it might have been to protect against that.
Thank you for 6his post ,you are valid,and so is your opinion

Hi, I am non-religious so excuse me if I say anything ignorant.

I think that it’s just sort of a divisive topic within secular belief right now… There are many Christians that would love you and support, I hope you can find them. 

“Transgenderism” has kind of been under a relentless attack by Right/Conservative media, both alternative and mainstream, which has a very large Christian demographic naturally… so… unfortunately, the way transgenderism is portrayed there can bleed into parts of the Christian community. 

So, yeah, sorry your faith has been getting attacked… I hope it gets better.

No matter what you deserve to be heard and appreciated, I’m so sorry.
Your heart is in thevright place.  Im sorry this happened to you. I hooe my story helps. For context, Im a Transwoman and fiercely support and defend our community.  Ive stopped usage of Transwoman. Im a woman. I dont need the prefix.  My life became less stressful once that realization happened. 
I wish you peace and happiness.
You should post it here or in mtf or wherever. I’m sorry anyone made you feel shitty. 

For what it’s worth: I don’t think there is any basis to see anything sinful being trans in scripture. Sure, there’s a command to not have homosexual sex, but that’s not trans stuff. 

There’s that crack about not cross dressing, but I read that more as a direct command from YHWH to live in keeping with your gender identity. Det. 22:5.  The plain text reading of that is the Lord that God finds trans people staying in the closet to be abominable. Which is harsh, but it is a deeply upsetting thing to do. 

(Though even that passage I think is inapplicable since it’s more about worship service attire, but it’s the only thing on point about gender expression in the canonical books of the Bible.)
Dam that pisses me off!

I want to be trans, but my parents are Catholic and strict 

&#x200B;

dont know how i'll convince them that I really want to change my gender 

&#x200B;

I want to express myself in different ways!   

Im worried and scared af
Christian is a very broad term. For example you have American Christians who are borderline fundamentalist and then you have European Christians who are much more mellow, open minded and accepting. In America Christians are taught to fear God and to follow the Bible. In Europe Christians are taught to Love God as He Loves them and to certainly read the Bible should they want to, but also to take it with a pinch of salt, since y'know it's like 1500+ years old and been rewritten, mistranslated, edited and changed many times to fit certain viewpoints and politics over the centuries. I assure you that should you seek support in a European Christian group (Catholic or Protestant) you'd find the support you're looking for.
My wife is trans, my eldest kid is NB … and God told me several years ago to go to a particular church. That church (Episcopalian) is welcoming and inclusive of their lgbtqia members and some of our fiercest advocates come from that community. So Jesus followers are out there that will love you. But we both come from homeschooled, fundie backgrounds so I know exactly what you’re talking about … and it breaks my heart. I have the verse where Jesus tells people woe unto you if you keep my children from coming to me going round in my head … and I feel the USA churches are going to have a major reckoning in their future (not that that helps people now). Anyway. I don’t know you but I love you and so does God, and there are Christian communities out there that will love you and embrace how wonderful you are♥️
I’m so sorry. I’m a Catholic trans dude and working on becoming a theologian myself, and it’s super shitty of them to silence you like that :( 
I’d love to read what you wrote!❤️

Edit: typo
Please do post it here!
Assuming you still have access, post what you wrote here! We’ll be happy to give you the time of day no matter what their mods think. At least your efforts won’t go *completely* to waste that way
I had a similar experience on r/AITA, but its probably for the best since people dont listen anyways and most people would probably put an angry comment on your post the moment they see a ""woke word"" anywhere outside of a trans/lgbt safe space. I know it sucks that you spent all of that time and effort making a post just to have it autoremoved, but if it didnt get autoremoved the backlash from the people in the subbreddit might have been worse.
trans Christian here. i'm sorry that happened.. i understand how frustrating it is. my family is the same way. not only do they not respect my identity as a queer person, but when i try to explain to them *how* i can be both a Christian and queer, and that it's not a sin, they *refuse* to listen. they are more interested in keeping the status quo and believing the traditional interpretation that they've been taught rather than being *objective* and at least listening to the interpretation i've found that looks at the original language, wording and context rather than a flawed translation.

it's disheartening, but stay strong. there will be people who will listen, understand and accept you and the truth ❤
I would be happy to engage in conversation with you about your being transgendered and your Christian faith. I am also both Christian and transgendered. To me, they definitely go well together!
After all the shit I've been through with being trans, I stopped believing in god. But I do feel bad for what happened, I am interested to see the post though.
Sorry you had to go through this. It’s stuff like this that made it easier for me to leave religion behind. That being said this is not say you should do the same. I’m just some idiot on the internet, I’m not here to challenge your beliefs.
Can I see your post that you posted in the Christian post?
While I still consider myself spiritual, believe in God etc, I am no longer religious. I have had past experiences one was directly involved with my church, which I was becoming highly involved with at the time. I have family and friends that are or were in the restaurant industry and people that go to church or are very vocal about their Christianity on average (not all of them) are some of the meanest people to deal with and don't listen to ANY reasoning even from the bible. Its a horrible feeling to deal with and is difficult to find people to talk to about it.

If you ever want to chat I'll be happy to talk! I'm not trans but have trans friends and I feel everyone should be treated equally!
I’m trans and Christian too and I would love to see your post it would be helpful to me if you could send it to me
https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2020/12/12/little-known-history-transgender-saints
I admit it's something I've struggled with, as a fellow trans Christian. I'm just glad to know I'm not alone, tbh.

Also I'm curious if you posted it anywhere else? I'd really like to read what you wrote, if you've still got it
It's such a shame they would remove your post but if you could re-tailor it slightly it might be wonderful to have here!
Christians have always been more hateful than Christ. I’m sorry. :( You might want to try r/Episcopalian for some acceptance and support.
My episcopalian church is pro trans. We're an off shoot of catholcicism. Brick walls, stained glass, and varnished pews, a classical aesthetic with a modern orthopraxis. You might like it.
FYI, I provided a very sincere response to something, and because i mentioned im tg, someone went ballistic and im now banned permanently from Christianity.  You're not alone.

I also mentioned to someone in FTM that a binder might cause them to have muscular and or skeletal problems if they wear it too long, that's been well noted. Apparently one of my messages went to a FtM TERF person and she (or, rather, he - sorry) bitched to a mod and so I got banned from that as well.

I'm now withdrawing ever so slowly from everything in Reddit and from Life in general.
I would definitely love to read this post of yours. It sounds excellent. :3
So much for Christianity being about love.
It is sad to see this but not surprising. I also identify as a Trans follower of Christ. I recently had former pastor from a conservative church I stopped attending 2years ago try to contact me about my ""trans struggles"". Most Christians are more interested in pointing out the sins of others and fall well short of demonstrating the love of Christ.

Do you still have your post? I would love to see your points as I was going to look for ways to combat typical Christian ""biblical arguments"".
I'm also Christian, and can't stand Christian subs. They're almost exclusively owned by conservative extremists, and don't really believe we belong in Christian spaces.

I tend to stick exclusively to explicitly liberal or queer spaces, or spaces of my specific denomination.

As a side note, I totally want to read what you wrote!
O hun 🫂🫂 well I think everyone here wood love to here it even if thay won’t and it my reach uves avenchl with eney luck :)
Remember True Christianity is loving and accepting EVERYONE. NO MATTER WHAT.

Any ""Christians"" that hate anyone, for any reason, aren't Christians, they're cultists

A bit of an extreme example of being a true Christian is say a guy kills someone, and the parents of the murder victim forgiving them, sure they could despise them to their very core but we aren't here to judge others, we're hear to enjoy this beautiful planet
Have you ever you read the stuff in there before this? You’d get the same reaction if you said you’re a satanist.
It stuff like this that made me question a lot of things. Like why is a serial murder considered equal to acting outside of your assigned stereotypes? Or if the bible was fake what incentive would its writer have? Is there evidence for or against the beliefs I hold? The just what though about when going through something similar.I hope find loving friends and I hope things change for the better.
If you have it saved, I would absolutely love to hear it. I'm sorry that happened to you.
It was removed in 11 seconds, so yeah, I'm pretty sure posts with transgender in them are an instant removal
I understand. It's been one of the most painful things of my life to feel like I'm a part of two worlds but don't belong to any, or like these worlds conflict and that I'm inherently an enemy to both because of my nature. When I'm not ostracized, I feel like my acceptance is conditional upon not acknowledging or sharing my queer and Christian identity. With these struggles, its been hard for me to accept that I truly can belong to both and that they can exist as one inside my identity. I still struggle with this a lot. Thanks for sharing. Maybe it's just me, but it feels like it's just a slim and lonely intersection of queer and Christian. So thanks for sharing.

Also if you haven't posted it here already (I haven't checked) and if you still have that post, I would love to read it edit: (okay I found the post in the comments)
[removed]
Disclaimer: This is the super harsh reality of why your post was immediately taken down. Welcome to the fangs of righteousness. I do NOT hold any of these beliefs. Not at all. Zero zilch nadda goose egg. Mods, if you have a problem then please tell me to take my comment down instead of suddenly banning me.

""But AnotherGlum, God made you perfect. Just the way you are. Why would you destroy the body that God gave you? Are you doubting that he made you in his image? Are you saying that your omnipotent and all knowing Lord made a mistake? Young lady, you're possessed by a male demon and he's tricked into thinking you're a man. It's best that we call an exorcist to save your soul. We want to see you in Heaven as a beautiful angel.""

This quote made possible and paid for by your local pastor, priest, and minister. I was raised a southern baptist honey. I know ALL of their phrases, mentalities, and head games. I'm a cisgender gay and I was bitten HARD by xtianity when I came out at 15. I can't possibly imagine what would've happened if I had come out as transgender. Some xtians aren't as cutthroat as what I paraphrased above BUT even if they don't say these things, they're always thinking them. ""Now praise the Lord, for he has risen indeed."" And make it sincere or else face the fires of hell.
I use to be christian myself. I do believe in God but I don't believe in 99% of all the man made lies. Like some words that have been changed on the Bible. For example ""Church"". The original word was Congregation, not church! They are 2 different things. I study different religions all my life and still do.. it's like my side hobby and the more i study them all, the more i understand the jig saw puzzle of ""God"". I ended up being shia Muslim and also trans. I still look like the tipical American and i stay quite and keep my beliefs btw me and God. There's mentions on the Bible about eunuchs and even Jesus talked nice things about them. Muslim Caliphates through out history also had eunuchs working with other women in their palaces. Although they were not on hrt, they would be castrated young and All the male hormones won't affect them. All my years of being Christian i have never ever ever heard a mention about them which makes me wonder if people are being selective on what to teach and what not to teach. I live a tipical life and I'm not much religious to be honest but when I think of God I'm proud to say that i have more information in my brain about God (Allah) than most of these old coots. Just don't worry about it. Just believe for you and keep it all to you. Remember if there is a God which i believe there is, keep it for you and lock yourself in a room and pray by yourself like the bible says. Don't be like the others doing it for show. May you be blessed and ignore the wolf's in sheep clothes 🕊️
No hate like Christian love
Damn, Im sorry...
I am atheist, but I have some friends who are indeed  Christians and they, I think, understand that being trans is nothing wrong in their religion.
Have a nice day, stay strong and feel better
 - Rita
No books needed to find god, just your heart. There is no need for middle men. Just saying...
I’m a Christian and would love to read what you posted
...and when abrahamic believers use logic and realise that their God being is non-binary and pansexual, they are like 😲.
I'm also a transgender christian and I'm so sorry this is has happened to you. It's annoying too when people say we are cherry picking the bible just so that we can live how we want. If God doesn't make mistakes than being trans can't be one of them.
Total shot in the dark here... you think maybe the word ""transgender"" is banned because Christians are transphobic and might use the word for ill will? I personally dont trust Christians to be that smart but hey 🤷🏼‍♀️ why are people so quick to come to their own conclusions smh
I'm Trans. Definitely not Christian. Curious how that works with your beliefs
I'd really be interested in seeing the original post, sounds like you did a really good job on it, sorry you were treated that way.
Didn't that Jesus of Nazareth guy advocate loving others as you'd have them love you? He kept it simple and didn't propose a ton of rules and laws to exclude folks as if they were black Democrats in Texas who are only trying to vote. It's like a friend once said to me in support of our non-christian status, ""What's the point of being a christian if you don't get to smite someone""?? Look around, Hon', you'll find a christian congregation that will accept you with open arms. Banging your head against the crowd you've been having problems with will only frustrate you, not to mention give you one helluva headache.
You may feel more comfortable at r/TransChristianity
One of the reasons I became satanist is just how hateful they are. I never got as much hate from anyone as from those with crosses on their necks. Also of course they don't want to learn. If they had critical thinking skills they wouldn't even believe in the first place
I’m sorry that you had such a backlash on a Christian subreddit. Honestly, I feel like we should  be praying for those Christians whose hearts are so hardened they can’t even listen to a different view point.

I’m a trans Christian, and unfortunately most Christians I’ve tried to explain it to either don’t understand the Biblical arguments, or subscribe to backwards cultural beliefs about gender.

I had a well-meaning friend suggest that I “just get closer to God“.   
‘Deepening my relationship with Jesus is always a good thing, but it‘s not going to cure dysphoria. That’s like telling someone to pray their cancer away.
You may have to walk your path in terms of religion on your own til you find someone to listen to you. I have my own beliefs apart from tradition
I really doubt most of the people calling themselves ""Christian"" actually are. My thoughts are that Jesus was forgiving and accepting of all of humanity and all its foibles. These people that hate/reject/scorn because of what another person is do not follow Jesus' teachings. 

I'm not a scholar. These are just my beliefs.
A follower of Jesus Christ here and I love you. Jesus tells us to love one another unconditionally and not JUDGE! Jesus never once said anything against LGBTQ+. He said love one another as you love yourself. We are to love one another because Jesus loves us. Remember, there are a lot of people out there who call themselves ""Christian"" yet wouldn't know the teachings of Jesus if it bit them in the, well, you know. I stopped calling myself ""Christian"" yrs ago when the RT Wing hypocrite's highjacked my faith. You don't need other's to validate you, you validate yourself.
personally I'm an atheist and don't know any christian spaces, but I hope you can find a sub that's accepting <3
While I am not transgender, I do come from a very “conservative Christian” household. For reference they are evangelical. After going to high school and getting a lot more perspective on the world and everything, I began to question all the beliefs I had before. I actively fought my parents over things like gay rights, BLM, why the system america has favors the rich vs the poor ect. I never got through to them because their beliefs are more important to them then how other people feel. They do not have any empathy for people who are different then they are, and actively fight against them because(it’s not gods way). It’s very infuriating and heartbreaking to watch s community that is supposed to love and support people have no empathy for people who don’t fit their view of god’s will.

I’m very sorry that happened to you. And I would gladly listen to what u have to say
Damn, that is not very christian of them (assessed by a religion minor, church volunteer youth worker, ex-lutheran). I'd be interested in hearing what you wrote. I assure you, there are good christians out there, it sucks that so many of us get these interactions with the ones who judge unfairly. Much love to you.
If more Christians gave a fuck about their damn religion maybe I’d give them some respect, but as far as I’m concerned if they ain’t gonna follow their own rules and twist them to attack me they can go fuck themselves, the only Christians I respect are already good people, the religion has nothing to do with it so fuck the religion. And this ain’t got shit to do with the religion or the beliefs, god could be real, could not be, but I ain’t concerned with that, the people make the religion and the people can go fuck themselves
I’m so sorry for this): it’s sad that Some Christians are so closed minded. I’m also trans and believe in God. It’s been really hard though. I’ve struggled a lot with knowing if God loves and accepts me since I’m trans. I would love for you to post that post here (: I wish so called Christian’s would would be more open and loving. Just cuz they claim being a follower of God don’t mean it’s true. You will know them by their fruits. Not by what they claim. In my experience most people that claim to know God don’t show it with their actions. Just know you are loved by God! And just because your trans don’t mean you can’t have a friendship with God. ANYONE can be close to God if their heart is open to that. ❤️
Try, but don't retry to explain yourself to people who are committed to misunderstanding you. 

You didn't choose to be born with the gender identity that you have and the body that you are in, or to experience dysphoria. But they choose to be hateful and hide behind the name of Christ to justify their ignorance and hate. 

Don't waste your time on haters, life is beautiful, live it to the fullest.

❤️
That's so amazing to hear your family is accepting and loving like that. I can't say the same about my family. I have yet to medically transition because im still not out to my family. But this gives me a slimmer of hope that I'll find a family who is this loving if my own family rejects me.
This 100%. The worst Christians who are so judgmental, fearmongering and close-minded are the farthest from the spirit of Jesus’ teachings they could possibly be.
My sister just told me I was going to hell and couldn't explain why besides ""It feels like a sin""
I love your Mom and Gram's! 💕💕
Thank you! It just sucks that i have to find a specific christian community that will accept me. But i will definitely look into this!

Also, when I say r/Christianity is a mixed bag, I mean that there are a lot of queerphobic people there, but there are also LGBT+ affirming people too. At least one mod is trans!

Judging from your profile, I'm guessing that the sub you are talking about is r/Christians. I don't know much about it, but, judging from it's statement of faith, it is not the most inclusive subreddit. It seems to be focused on a rather specific version of Protestant Christianity, despite the name (which is not necessarily surprising).
thank you!! <3
Hopefully. I just really wanted to reach those who don't understand LGBT struggles. Hopefully I'll get the chance one day though.
I could pm it to you if you'd like?
I'm not christian and I'd still like to read the post.
yeah, i get that. thats the whole reason i wanted to make that post in the first place, was to just talk with them. i did want to try and change their views, i just wanted to talk to them and explain my experiences. but they didn't even give me a chance which i half expected. just surprised me that how quick it got taken down, almost like bots are scanning for lgbt posts in that subreddit to take them down whenever they appear. 

i hope there will be a time when im alive when things change for the better for us.
You express yourself so well! I hope you’ll find a place where Christians will listen to your testimony and open their hearts and minds to what you have to say.
Thank you, and best wishes to you as well!
Thank you so much. This means the world to me!
\*disenfranchised trans Christian hugs\*
Thank you! This means a lot. But I'm a trans man so probably not best to refer to me as sister lol, but i didn't specify in my post so I'm not offended, don't worry!
yeah i get where you're coming from. i also wasnt too surprised when it got taken down, more so surprised on how fast it was taken down. i wont let people like this ruin my faith though. the only validation i need is from God Himself. I can try to get people to understand and tolerate me and my experiences, but if they don't even want to listen there's nothing more i can do except to just pray about it tbh. still just needed to vent about it, and getting all this feedback and discussion in the comments of this post is just what i wanted. I never wanted to force them to change their views, i just wanted to talk to them. but sadly a lot of them just dont want to even listen to you.
I've posted the link to a Google doc that's has it somewhere in the comments under this post, I'm not at my computer right now to link it under this comment. If you're not able to find it, i will link it here when i get the chance!

This Christian meme sub is a new one! Thank you so much!
Cool thanks!
THIS is WHY I am NOT RELIGIOUS. If I were religious, I wouldn’t BE ABLE TO BE A BOY. I WANT to be a boy and HAVE made myself a boy. I do NOT WANT to be religious and I. AM. HOW. I. WANT. MYSELF. TO. BE. YOU CANNOT CHANGE HOW I AM. I AM HOW I AM. IF YOU ARE CHRISTIAN, THAT IS OK. But you do NOT have the right to tell me WHO I AM. I am NOT A GIRL ANYMORE. Transgender people DO NOT DISOBEY GOD. A MAJORITY OF CHRISTIANS are disobeying god by NOT ACCEPTING US WHO WE ARE. (I don’t know the Bible but surely it’s not right to tell people who they are and not who they want to be?)
Got any quotes to support that?
Did you delete the quote you responded with? Because it seems you did. 

It's a bigoted quote though, and does support your sentiment, but I don't believe it mentions transgender stuff.

I literally said i was Christian and you still thought posting this comment was a good idea? I mean,, idk what you were going for with this comment but it was not helpful lol
Wow, it's almost like you accomplished absolutely nothing with this comment except showing me that the trans community can be just as toxic at invalidate an aspect of my identity and who i am! Thank you so much for your input on my religious views! Hope you have a blessed day <3
A lot of the scripture is explained significantly better in [this](https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-transgender-people) link than i could ever hope to explain them. This helped me a lot in coming to terms with my own identity in my faith!
point of order: you are trans whether you transition or not. You are born trans, that's how it works. You don't want to be trans, you want to *transition*.
even in America christianity is pretty broad. i don't really practice/believe these days myself, but the (presbyterian) church I grew up with is super accepting

This means so much to me. My relationship with God and my faith is something very personal and dear to me, and to be cast out by the very people who are supposed to welcome me, and i welcome them, hurts so much. So this honestly means a lot. Thank you <3
I don’t know your family but you never know, yeah? It’s one of those “hope for the best, prepare for the worst” things and it’s all you can really do. It’s unfortunate how being happy in your own body can cost one a whole family connection at times, it shouldn’t be that way.
💯
That’s dumb. Don’t listen to her, if you believe in god then believe the way that feels right, nobody alive today could possibly be able to interpret a deity’s word ya know?
If im going to hell anyways aswell ill make this world my living little hell pit
Im sorry but thats actually hilarious-
Me too, I miss her a lot.
> i have to find a specific christian community that will accept me.

I mean... It does suck, but that kinda applies to almost everyone. Despite claiming to represent the almighty and all-pervading God, the vast majority of Christian sects aren't exactly all that inclusive of the different types of people in this world. Many churches don't allow POC, don't allow anyone LGBT+, don't allow anyone gender-nonconforming, don't allow unconventional clothing, accents, or ideas, etc. etc. etc. 

For another good and accepting one, try /r/radicalchristianity
Yeah. It does suck. The UMC church is having a messy split over LGBTQ inclusion. And it’s heartbreaking. God and the Bible are LGBTQ affirming; but not all church leaders are. It’s frustrating and heartbreaking.
r/openchristian is a more general Christian sub where there's room for sincere talk about all kinds of topics, including lgbt posts.

I'm also transgender and Christian, and I've found that sub to be very warm and, well ... open ;)
The Episcopal Church is also welcoming to trans people.
Should be a giant clue for you. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
And in particular, if you're a ""true"" <religious denomination> then you're almost guaranteed to be a gatekeeping asshole with an opinionated interpretation of things who gets their rocks off by tricking others into giving you some validation.

Source: grew up in a ""true Christian"" church that taught it's members to self-isolate lest they be led astray by all the ""false"" Christians of the world or the devil's temptations of a worldly lifestyle.
Of course! God bless!
Hi, I’d like to read it too
Yeah that’s fine
I would also like to read it
Lol I’m so sorry!
Of course happy to help
Sadly yes. The bible was written in a time where it was looked down upon and came to popularity when that was even more the case. Although there is an argument to be made that the truth is human sexual concepts were barely a thing and extremely different to what we know it as now that would probably also throw a philosophical stick in trying to stay true to anything else within it. As well as strict concepts of gender also having come to fruition by that time in that part of the world where it was written. The truth is Christianity as a concept grew up with regressive social norms and matured by the blood of every culture who wouldn't immediately assimilate. Modern Christians just can't argue that the original beliefs weren't exclusionary and socially regressive, because they were. You'd have to argue through the abstract ideals the texts represent and argue for reformation as those during the enlightenment had to do. This is true for every religious movement. We have to have enlightenments not try to look to the past. Although doing this within a religious framework is damn near impossible. Its probably their problem anyway. I am incapable of thinking within the confines of non-secular morality due to not knowing what religion even was until I was like nine.
Sorry, I was venting... I grew up in a small town whose Christianity hated the entire LGBT community with all their hearts. I kind of grew to believe all Christianity was bad.
Yeah sorry not sorry,  I am anti theist. We can talk about this if you want. And don't generalize trans community here please
[deleted]
same thing lol
Cool thank you! I’ll read it when i get the chance.
yeah, although i know my family's opinions about it, they're super vocal but they do let their views known. my dad had an entire ""dont let college turn you guy"" conversation with me on my way to move into my college dorm room.
Yeah she's just ignorant and stupid. I felt more embarrassed for her than anything

I'm moving on without my old family and creating a new one from friends and people who aren't hateful bigots
Amen. I remember once (before I knew I was trans) I was at a teen church group. We were going through the bible and analyzing the possible meanings of each passage. I remember the group leader stressing how Jesus was sinless. I found this interesting, since I was also learning ethics in a DE class in school. I then went through the bible looking at every action Jesus did and compared them to each ethics theory I learned about (AND the 10 commandments). I ended up finding a few contradictions for every ethics theory I tested (and a few commandments). I then explained my findings to the teen group leader, with the proposition that instead of Jesus being sinless, he was just the closest thing that can exist on earth. The Group leader just yelled at me about how I was setting such a bad example and how my actions are just going to one day turn me away from god. I ended up leaving that group shortly after, for a completely unrelated reason.

&#x200B;

Basic point is, even if they say they are open to ideas, they often are only open to some ideas
not really- a big divide rn is between colonized and colonizing countries’ churches. colonized countries had homophobic and transphobic rhetoric imparted upon them by the west that is causing this.

lol you're totally fine!!
See this is all well and good, and I pretty much agree with you.

But I asked for quotes. The other person linked one and then seemingly deleted the comment. I read some of it in my notification, and it didn't say a single thing about transgender stuff.

Edit: the quote they liked is totally bigoted and shows off just why the Bible is immoral, btw. I just find it interesting it has nothing to do with trans stuff. I'm interested in finding anything that doesn't support trans stuff.
It's okay, i understand that, but it's important to know not everyone in a generalized group is the same. Just like we want people to stop assuming everything bad about the LGBT community, we can't assume everything bad about Christianity. I've seen both the bad side, and the really beautiful and positive side of Christianity, it exists :) they're just not as loud as the bad side, unfortunately
I'm an atheist too, i enjoy a good debate, but this really isn't the way to go about any of it. You're just being a prick to someone who clearly doesn't want to put up with someone like that right now.
I understand that not everyone has the same beliefs as i do, and this post was not about debating religion. It was simply a vent about something that didn't go like i planned. I don't care if someone doesn't believe in Christianity, but that doesn't mean it's okay to call my having the religious beliefs I do a sad thing. My post was not about debating religion, and my personal views are not up for debate. I don't call other people's beliefs sad, i respect you and your views. I only ask you do the same to me. 

I know i could've handled that comment better, and i apologize for harmful tone. It was just a really unnecessary comment that i didn't need at the time.
Good for you, I proud of you!!
>The Group leader just yelled at me about how I was setting such a bad example and how my actions are just going to one day turn me away from god.

It's a beautiful irony how those kinds of people drive people away from Christianity in droves.
That’s actually super interesting! Can you give an example of one of the contradictions with the 10 Commandments?
It sucks that some people will work so hard and look into things, come up with new (and in this case, more realistic) ideas, and then some will be too bigoted to even take those things into consideration
Yeah, it's the west. Definitely no homophobia and misogyny elsewhere... Jfc. Actually read the Bible one time.
I just got through reading the post. It was incredibly well thought out. Thanks for sharing it. I'm sorry that the sub it was posted on wasn't willing to engage with you thoughtfully. It is super frustrating. God bless!
Oh well trans as a concept was wildly different back then, only abrahamic religion I know that mentions it is old Judaism which had multiple genders.
I don't want to go good way about it, I am staying an opinion, and I'm also an anti theist.
This right her is the reason people are leaving the Church. ☝️☝️
So it has literally been like 6 years or so at this point, so **I DON'T REMEMBER EVERY DETAIL AND I MIGHT BE MISREMEMBERING SOMETHING, SO DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH BEFORE USING ME AS A SOURCE**. I remember finding something like 6-7 he could have been argued to have broken. Here are just a few from memory (without the actual chapters etc. because frankly, I don't want to go looking for them). Note, I will NOT be doing any follow-ups for the details of this.

&#x200B;

1. \----------------- removed since I do not want to argue over what is the right interpretation 

&#x200B;

2) You shall not make idols - The cross could be argued for this one. Thing is that Jesus was dead and it really is other people that broke this one, due to his actions. I did concede this one in my argument, but thought it was worth noting, since it is still honored today. -------Stuff from first one-------------- Mary is also worshiped in some religions, but there is nothing I found that points to Jesus having done actions to make this happen. Therefore, I conceded this as being someone else's sins as well.

&#x200B;

4) Remember the Sabbath day, To keep it holy - Jesus was accused several times of breaking the sabbath. This once again could be argued since keeping it holy is very subjective. I conceded this one, but wanted to note it since it points at another possible one he broke.

&#x200B;

5) Honour your father and your mother - He did a few actions as a kid that seemed to contradict this. I don't remember the details though. This was actually one of the reasons I started, since I found several cases of this one. He did some actions later on that contradicted this, but they were far more arguable. I remember finding something like 10-12 times he broke this one though.
This isn't the time to try to get someone to leave their religion. Don't take advantage of someone having a bad time to convert them to your way of thinking. It's toxic no matter who is doing the converting.
My Mom went to the National UMC conference. There is division in the U.S, sure; but the vote was swayed primarily by votes in colonized countries. We’re talking about a specific denomination under the Protestant umbrella, under the broader Christian umbrella. I’m an atheist with a good amount of religious trauma and happily shit on bad (read: most) aspects of Christianity- but I respect and understand the people who find community and purpose with it. It’s not hard.
Thank you, this means a lot! It hurt to spend so long on this only to not even be considered. So this means a lot to me! God bless!
Interesting, if you have any more information on the topic, like a quote or other resource, I'd be interested in seeing it.
Your ""anti theism"" lead you to being a prick to someone else for no reason. There are ways to voice opinions without completely disregarding the feelings of others. Especially on a post made specifically about those feelings.
Now, I enjoy some theological debate considerably more than the next person, but “actually, Jesus isn’t God” is kind of a big one to just casually start out with given that that’s opposed to the general fundamental tenets of…at least most Christianity. If someone doesn’t believe that he was God, then the rest of your argument kind of just follows from that, but if someone does, then you’re a bit dead in the water on a subjective point.
I don't care what they believe, I care that they are surprised that bigots exist when it's explicitly spelled out in their holy books.  
""*If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them*."" <--- it's literally in every Bible. All of them. It shouldn't be a shock to find out **some** people who think that's the word of the creator of the whole universe might not like you if you're a member of the LGBT family.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender\_and\_Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_and_Judaism)

What I was talking about. Sources should be cited.
My church was open to the idea he was the son of god, so that itself was not an issue. Don't want to debate over which is right.

Either way, I really don't want to argue about this, so I will likely at some point remove my original message anyways.
> ""If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them."" <--- it's literally in every Bible. All of them.

That's not in any Bible that was written before 1946 when all the different versions of the Bible were re-translated.

Prior to that it was ""Man shall not lie with young boys as he does with a woman, for it is an abomination.""
You're not being helpful, you're being a jerk.
Oh that's super neat, thank you!
Yeah I'm going to have to see your Bible. Did you get it at a Qanon conference or something?
If a black person posted online that they were surprised they couldn't find a more accepting chapter of the KKK I'd say the same thing. Face reality and you'll do better in life than if you hide from it.
Your welcome, this kinda stuff interests me so I tend to have more knowledge about the historical context of the beliefs rather than the beliefs themselves.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity_and_homosexuality

>The first instance of the English word ""homosexuals"" used in a biblical translation was in the RSV New Testament published from 1946 until 1970, which simultaneously removed most ""fornication"" admonitions found in the prior ASV (1901) and KJV (1611) Bibles. Historically, the Vulgate contains the Latin stem ""fornicat"" within 92 verses representing sixteen centuries of Christian tradition on literally wording sexual admonishments, while verses now rebuking homosexuals were described in the Vulgate equivalent to ""male-prostitute male-concubines"". RSV set a modern trend in literally rebuking ""homosexuals"".

---

And/Or https://www.google.com/search?q=Bible+1946 and take your pick.
It really doesn't matter right now. Don't try to deconvert people in these situations.
I'm trying to get a podcast going with my homie, and he suggested an episode on if trans people and religion will ever get along. It's a very loaded question, so we decided we should be looking into this for what we can in the mean time. 

So yeah, I'm excited to look into these sources. The first one listed is particularly interesting.

It’s called a shillelagh!! To help you find one! Lol they double as a club
The leprechaun in the Boston Celtics logo has one.

I believe in Irish folklore leprechauns would typically carry shillelaghs to beat off the pesky kids trying to steal their Lucky Charms.

I may not have actually researched that very hard though.
He’s just that powerful
Dude I fucking wish hahah I still looked 14 for like my first two years.

Oh, think “Tesseract” from the Marvel movies. A four-dimensional cube projected into three-dimensional space. The image on her arm looked like one but it could be styled into a logo or something. The image has been around for decades so may be public domain, I mean, you can’t really copyright a cube right?
Congratulations, much love! Keep that train going, you deserve to feel 💯 authentically yourself. 💕
It's never too late! 🤍
Ohhhh it’s just another name for a tesseract
Also, your top is 🔥 and I might have to know where you got it. 🥺
It's an album cover from a band called TesseracT 🤍💠

I thought I was happy with my outfit until I took pictures 🥲		"The council has conferred and come to the decision that you look great and very feminine. You are liked. That is all.
I'm happy with your outfit, I think it's cute!
for a second i forgot i was on a trans sub, and i was super confused XD you look great, and i cant imagine a world in which that look isnt passing
Don't forget the camera is literally a liar. The size of the lens subtly distorts your features, the way images are composited changes things, the app itself tries to make the image pop more. What you see in the mirror is not what you will get from your phone. It's not you, it's the phone. If you loo cute to yourself, you're not wrong. :) And you look very cute in the picture so that means you're just even cuter in reality.
You look amazing! 🤗
pretty. loving the jewelry too!
Where the problem at bestie? It’s so cute!
You look gorgeous!
That baphomet necklace is so cool
Go outside and take a photo of the moon at the next available opportunity. Does it look good in the photo as it does through your eyes? No. Same applies for you and photos.
I know the feeling, sometimes I really like how an outfit feels/looks from my first person perspective but then I see it in a mirror/third person and suddenly find I don't like it.

&#x200B;

This outfit super cute though and suits you well. Also really like your room aesthetic, especially the model boat with the vines
Darling you rock that outfit so well! You look absolutely stunning!
That necklace is so cool!! Where did you get it??
…and now you are… ecstatic 🤩!
I love your style ! Honestly, I feel a little jealous because I don't think I could rock it as well as you do ! (stupid broad shoulders...)
wow you look so much more masculine!!!
OMG you're so cute, I'm jealous! 💕
What? Gurl it's so cute and you look hot af!
If that ain't a mood...I've felt the same way many time, but for what it's worth I think what you have going on looks good.
Oh god I’m loving it! Getting inspired!!
I thought it looked great. Kind of jealous.
Add a belt to define your waist that might help
Your outfit is super cute and you look happy in it!
I chose to read your title as ""I thought I was happy with my outfit until I took pictures, at which point, I realized I was euphoric with it""
I love your sweater where did you get it?
Nah it looks sick. Just play some type o negative while you dress!
I bet you don’t like it because it’s 50/50 on your body, maybe try to adjust it to be 1/2 or 2/1 ratio, that usually helps me like my outfit :))
Your outfit is great!
I don’t know what you’re talking about you are beautiful and perfect. Your outfit is beautiful also
You look super cute!
i love you
That outfit is very cute.  I'd love to be able to rock it like you do.

Thats such a cute outfit
Take back those words.  You look great in that outfit the pictures are just proof of how cute you look in them
Throw on some glasses and you’d look exactly like a goth girl I saw in a used bookstore the other day. Obv I thought she was cute bc I still remember her.
What!?! It looks (you look) fabulous!!!
I think you look great
Wdym it’s an adorable outfit! I never fully trust pictures to capture my own fits 😤
I love this look! 😍 super cute and you rock it very well
You look perfect ❤️
Oh its a very cute outfit! Love the pattern on the tights! Or leggings, or stockings, whichever
You’re cute AF!❤️
What's not to be happy about? You are a cute goth girl!
I don't see what you mean, your outfit looks gorgeous ^w^
Looks good 👍
What do you mean? You look really good in the fit! Don’t doubt yourself, be confident in what you wear.
It's a great outfit!! But if you don't like it, I'd be happy to take that necklace off your hands~
Looks amazing 😍🔥🔥🔥
SLAYING
Omg what do you mean, I only seen these 3 pictures and I have a crush lol

But in all seriousness you look amazing, and that outfit absolutely slays💜
I always have that problem, and I'm not even trans lol the camera LIES to us, what we see in the mirror is perfect, don't let the lense of the camera distort how you feel ❤ I be a 10/10 in the mirror and a 3/10 in my eyes in pictures lol
I love your necklace, also the whole outfit is just great
you look cool as fuck…..
i know I'M happy with this outfit! looks so fricken cool!!
You look amazing ☺️
You look so cute!
I bet what you don't like is the proportions. To me it looks like you're wearing your skirt a little low. + That sweater is too long for you It's lengthening your torso.

These two things are giving you long awkward torso and short legs.

Take a safety pin or two and like, curl your sweater under at the bottom. Pin it like . . .  a few black stripes higher and pull your skirt higher on your waist. Play with it in the mirror and judge the proportions and make adjustments.

You'll be able to see where you want things to sit for future outfits.
Be happy again!
I love your outfit! You’re really cute. Cameras can never show how beautiful we are irl
Cottagecore goth!!!!!!
nooo it’s cute !!!
HUH?? beautiful
It’s a really cute!!
You and your outfit are adorable! I actually just got that sweater in the mail today too lmao
Does anyone know what that gorgeous lacy pantyhose-like thing she’s wearing is called? Is it just “pantyhose”, or does it have a specific name? I need it.
I think it's a very pretty outfit and you look very cute in it.
Looking good 💓 Love the pendant, earrings upside down though? 😈
So cute! The outfit looks fantastic on you!
God damn thats so cute and it's made me want to get tights like that
Are you kidding???? You're STUNNING!!!!

Yeah as a photographer. Focal length of a lens can vastly change the perspective of a face and body.
My old phone would autocorrect my coloring making me look better then I am
That's so Kind, thank you. 
It Just Sometimes Takes the confidence Out of me, or reminds me of horrible masculin Features.
Basically what I said, without any real info to back it xD I just know the camera always lies to me xD
Ehhhh AliExpress 😅
Seconded.
Thank youuuu. Don't be, am Sure You would Look fantastic!
Bro ,what 💀 ,she doesn't
Hahaha. You're a dickhead. Go back where you came from.
I think every or Most Trans-People expirience this, it's annoying. I end Up rethinking my Outfit choice afterwards.
Also thank you
It does , the layers Just Look a little weird
I have no idea what this means? Are you talking about the positioning of the clothes or the camera focus or something?
Thank you, that is very true.
Awwww thanks 💜
Haha maybe I should wear glasses then 😁
These Kinds of tights are amazing, they're good looking and comfy 🥰

Like, higher waist pants that cover like 2/3 of your body and a cropped sweater or a long sweater that hangs over the top 2/3 of your body and then casual pants or stockings/thigh highs and cute shoes for the 1/3

I’ve you’ve ever done photography or known a photographer, you’ll know that framing photos with 1/3s proportions makes them more appealing to the human brain, like a shore taking the bottom 1/3 and the sky taking the top 2/3 and someone standing centered in the middle 1/3 of the shor, etc 

These same principals apply to outfits as well, it’s not like super important but it can make an outfit much more visually pleasing than previously :))
This is the way

Ah, right! Not photography but art history and theory so I get what you mean. I wasn't aware that there was a psychological component to it though. I just thought it looked pretty.

I'll have to take that into account. I'm loving low rise jeans at present so I might need to have a think about how to make it work.

Wow, you look happy AND gorgeous! Looking forward to my own beach daze!
Did you say going to the beach? I can't hear you over the blizzard outside
You look soooo good in that cut of shirt. Sorry idk what it’s called. Showing off your collar bones and shoulders and that gorgeous ponytail! Girl your cute 60s vibes are off the chart!
I'm jealous af. You look so happy. 

41F and rainy here. My sundresses and bathing suits are still in bags, but they are begging to be taken out. Spring is so close.

Thanks for sharing.

Status Update: I was gonna come out to my sister...	"But it turns out, after all the emotions and working up the courage to actually telling her that I'm trans, I didn't come out to my sister, I came out to my brother!

I had no idea and he had been closeted to family for years, I'm so happy that we both were able to actually be ourselves. We had a talk and got to use our preferred names and pronouns and it's been probably the most cathartic experience of my life being able to tell him I'm a woman. I'm happy that my brother told me who he really is, it's just such a wild feeling."	"Wow I thought this was going to be a really sad story but that's awesome! You two could probably help eachother a lot and that's amazing! Low-key jealous but def happy for you
bro really said “uno reverse”
The best thing about this is, that your parents won't be able to say ""BUT I LOST A SON"" cuz you can just point to your bro and say ""Nah, he's right there"" and vice versa.
That’s beautiful.
❤❤❤ the good ending. I was worried there. Happy you have each other!
Same happened to me. Came out to my little sister, found out I had a little sister.
Same happened for me!
That is so wholesome and special!! Congrats on coming out to you and your brother ❤️
This rejuvenated my soul and warmed my heart🧡
*insert Spider-man and Spider-man pointing at each other meme here*
Ok mum, dad, the good news is you still have a daughter and a son
HOLY SHIT, this is amazing. The actual perfect outcome. You can stand by each other through this and always have each other's backs. Massive bonding moment.
The same thing happened to me and my brother. Our mum's been kind of a pill about the whole thing, not sure what her problem is, she's got the same number of sons and daughters that she started with.
Oh I love this, I was not expecting such a wholesome twist! I’m happy for both of you!
Well this is my favorite coming out story so far.
*hey brain, can I have the courage to come out to my sister?*

*to your sister?*

*yes.*

*(actually gives you the courage to come out to your brother like a boss)*

I'm so sorry, I know it's cringe, but I couldn't help myself
Wait a real happy coming out story! And to top it even better than what you could’ve imagined! 

I’m so happy for you both!
awh that’s amazing im happy for you both<3
I thought it was going to be a sad story but omg this is just so awesome, makes my heart melt
the gender swaperoo. Congratsss!!!!
Congratulations to you and your brother!
That's the most wholesome thing I've read today.
I'm imagining the scenario ended up just being that spiderman meme where you're both pointing at each other. thank you.
That is wild!! Congrats to you both ❤️
What are the odds?
This patches holes in my broken heart, this is the kind of wholesome content I look forward to
My kid sibling came out to me as gender fluid and I had the pleasure of responding with, “me too.” That’s not exactly my identity but similar, and trans nonetheless. They were very nervous to tell me as it’s been difficult for them. I’m still relatively new to this journey, and it was so special to be able to sit in their car and talk about the things we have in common. For me it was one of the first times I really felt understood. We both come from a very conservative Christian household so it’s beautiful to see how much we’ve both grown individually. It’s a really awesome connection. So happy for you, friend. 🤍
sgsjfkgkgk the title had me worried, but congrats to you both!!!
Perform the ol switcheroo!
i came out to my sibling and then they came out as agender LMFAO it was like the spider man meme
\*trades clothes\* tada! Welcome to Christmas 2022.
oooh double
This is just 🥺🥺I love this so much. Thank you for sharing
your brains got swapped at birth lol
lol for a second i was like thats awesome now u can both tell ur sister together 😂
I remember preparing to come out as a guy to my family for a few months. My older brother was already out, and then my youngest sibling came out as non-binary about two weeks before I was planning to. I was like, ""Well fuck, y'all stole the show. I am also trans"". So yeah, three out of the four of us are out as trans and we're all kind of waiting on the fourth, because there's a bit of a vibe.
Task failed successfully
yeah so this exact thing happened with my brother and i [both transmasc] and we have grown so close, its the closest we have ever been and its really amazing being able to confide in him. 
congrats OP in coming out, im very happy for you :))
This took me a minute to get 0.0
You two just switched places lol
Yeah seriously.
Slide to the left, slide to the right, criss cross!
or maybe “uno draw two”
""My brother and I have come to a decision.""

""Don't you mean 'my sister and I'?""

""No, we are switching. I am the sister now.""
Oh. And they can come out together. I’m so jealous!
According to available statistics, 0.0016%.
That sounds like how it went for me! I'm the kid sibling and hearing my brother tell me ""Me too!"" As I told him I was trans like a huge moment of shock and happy all wrapped into one. It felt like I wasn't alone in my otherwise crappy family for once, like I've always felt solidarity with him when it came to family but now the bond is even stronger I feel.
Switch names too to really mess with your parents.
""Look at me! I am the Sister now!""
A lot of times lately, I actually feel really lucky to be trans, regardless of hardships. This is something that couldn’t be recreated in any other way. A special bond of love and understanding that will never go away! Sometimes I just gotta remember the wins.

Spouses transition.	Long story short my mother thinks my spouse should wait until our kids are grown to transition. I honestly don't care when she transitions. I just want her happy and smiling. Advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone.	"Short answer: No. They should transition when they want to do it. Transitioning or being trans is not some 18+ stuff or harms children.
I don't think you should allow your mother having a say into this. It's your spouse's life and, since your kids are yours, it's a matter that they should only discuss with you.  
Really, your mother should be totally out of this.
All I can add is my own experience.  I waited for my kids to get a bit older before I started transitioning. I hid it away for 10 years.
Basically I did myself (and my family) a lot of damage by doing this.  
I had a lot of internalised anger as a result that would work its way out and I honestly was not a very good parent.
The short time I have been transitioning both of my kids have acknowledged I'm much more chilled and a much nicer person to be around (basically the parent they would have liked 10 years ago).
Plus I have 10+ years of male image to now undo.
So if you feel comfortable with it and are willing to support her, then go for it. And encourage your mother to support her too, this way the kids will get the positivity from all sides and there will be no negative stigma to place doubts in their minds
In the least harsh way possible, she should really butt out.

The conservation needs to be between you and your spouse *alone*, other people's opinions are meaningless here.

As for 'confusing the kids', this is exactly the same fallacious argument people make about kids finding out that someone is lesbian/gay/bisexual. Kids can actually pick up on sexuality and gender stuff *very easily* and for the most part don't care in the slightest - it's only adults that have the problem. Source: I have several nieces and nephews ages 7-12 and none of them care in the slightest that I'm married to a man.
Why is your mother involved? I'm sorry, but this should be between spouses when it comes to upbringing. Your mother isn't a part of your marriage bed and she needs to know that. She isn't making the legal, health, or providing full time around the clock sole financial or otherwise care for your children. You and your spouse are. Even if this is about kids, they typically understand concepts easier than adults if they're quite young. Around teenage age they may have some figuring out to do and possibly may need to talk to someone outside the family, but it still wouldn't confuse or harm a youngster. It's adults typically who backlash due to they have ingrained stereotypes and notions of what anything should be.
Kids are way less stubborn than adults are when it comes comes stuff like this. I doubt they’d have a complete meltdown over her transitioning
Those kids won’t be nearly as confused as your mother is, kids are very impressionable and accepting. If they have questions, you seem like you’re more than capable of answering them. Your mother doesn’t deserve to revoke your or your spouse’s right to bodily autonomy
The kids most likely won't care. Kids are much less hard to get the message through than even adults. If they don't want or try to understand, you're their parent. It's your job to make sure they understand and to not be hateful of different people. You're the parent here. These are your kids. Most little kids out there arre able to understand this.
My son started calling me mommy before I even started transition. No problems at all
I cannot think of a possible reason why it would ""confuse"" the kids that doesn't boil down to transphobia, and I would love to hear one. When people argue that things will ""confuse"" kids, they almost always mean ""I am afraid of X and I am uncomfortable about the idea of kids being ok with it."" The only thing that might confuse the kids is why their grandparent is transphobic.

""Teaching kids about gay people will confuse them"" = I am a homophobe 

""Teaching kids about evolution will confuse them"" = I am a creationist.

""Teaching kids about America's history of racism will confuse them."" = I am a racist.

""Teaching kids about other religions will confuse them"" = I am a religious bigot.

""Teaching kids about trans people will confuse them."" = I am a transphobe.
My children are my biggest supporters! They also respect me more for being honest. I suggest you let your spouse decide for herself , she is very lucky to have you by the way. May smiles be abundant in your lives.
my grandma said i should wait till she was dead to transition. fuck that noise, your life works on your own timetable. kids are adaptable. moreso than most people. it might take some work and explaining, but they'll understand.
Hello!   I am 33 and my fiancé is 38 and is now transitioning to female.  Our youngest is 18 months and 3 years old.  

I think you need to have a serious talk with your kids depending on how old they are. Also have a talk with spouse and ask for a timeline ish what they want and what there plans are 

Right now my fiancé is starting HRT and then will be wanting surgery in 2-3 years depending.  

In everything aside how will this effect your kids.  Guess what it doesn’t negatively effect them.  They will grow up to more understanding and compassionate for other people no matter who they are.  

Just think of what life would look like to them.  Would you rather have a miserable person just making it through life because your not ready.  No!  Be happy and everyone else will also be happy too 

Your mother doesn’t have to go through this directly rather indirectly through you.  So truly she will not know how it feels to be in the trenches and what needs to happen.  

My fiancé’s dysphoria is so bad a lot of days are suicidal until HRT starts.  I think you just need to look at a kids point of view and a lot of kids don’t care in all reality.  

One thing you do have to talk to them about is who is safe to tell.  Not everyone is understanding and still have to be careful.   Good luck!
Your mother is wrong. My daughter was the fastest to accept me, the most accepting of me, and truly, if anything, prefers me as her mother. Believe it or not two happy moms is much better for a family than a miserable dad. She just has a hetero cis normative view of what a family should look like.
Your mother sounds like a real piece of work. Advice: tell her to mind her own business and stfu.
My 3 year old nephew doesn't seem to care that I am auntie. My 9 year old niece doesn't seem to mind. I'd actually argue it would be harder for them to understand when they are older than when they are young.
Tell your mother to keep this to herself.  

Their mom's transition will not hurt your kids, but their grandmother trashing their mom behind her back will.
Kids love you unconditionally, transitioning isn't gunna change that. Yeah they'll ask more questions but that's what kids do. Transitioning is literally mental health care. Your mother is either being discriminatory or has been misinformed by dangerous sources.
I think it would be so much better for your children to have a happy mother who’s transitioned than an unhappy parent who’s constantly hiding a part of themselves. Kids aren’t stupid, they know when things aren’t quite right. Being trans isn’t some super secret NSFW 18+ only thing, there are plenty of trans kids themselves and having a parent who is openly and comfortably themselves, whatever stripe of the LGBT rainbow that might be, can only be a good thing. 

I’m sure your mother meant well but it just shows she doesn’t understand about trans issues properly - maybe this is a good way to try and introduce her to it more and help her learn? At least if she’s open to that.
Hi, Cis Het dude’s opinion, feel free to ignore it (since we get the floor more than we deserve). I think your mum should mind her own business. If your partner is ready to transition, it’s your partners decision. 

I guarantee the thing that will be best for your kids is having two happy, self actualized and realized parents. 

Tell your partner I (for one) support her decision.
suppressing who you are to make others comfortable is a horrible standard to set for a child

not that it's bad to debate it, if anything it's a very selfless and noble thing to consider and your partner is very kind. but would you rather teach your kid to hide themselves and judge others, or to be themselves and accept people that turn out a little different?

(also your mom needs to realize it's not a fetish, it's not going to disturb or confuse the kiddos if you just explain a little)
I started transitioning when my kids were 5 and 1 and they have been fine. Kids really don't care as long they are loved, they aren't confused, they aren't disappointed and they aren't transphobic. Your mother sounds like she is though.
Don't listen to her, for a start it's got Jack to do with her, but also she is 100% wrong.
Yeah that’s a bad idea. Transition now. Kids will be happier with happier parents.
Tell your mother that it's not up to her. She doesn't know what it's like. Your spouse should transition when they're ready to. No sooner or later.
As a kid of a trans person no it won't confuse the kids (what might confuse them is the fact that certain people hate trans people just for being trans or might call their mom a man with the purpose of trying to hurt her feelings), just explain that their mom was born in the wrong body so she is taking medicine to make it better, depending on how old the kids are. My mom transitioned when I was about 7 and because of that I was introduced to an amazing community, if she hadent been such a bad person I probably would have figured out that I am trans sooner. 

I think explaining it to a kid at a younger age will make them feel safer in their house if they turn out to be lgbtq as well, and even if they aren't lgbtq it still gives them a definite safe space to explore who they are as people as they get older. 

Besides how your kids will react to it, it's also not your moms choice, it's your wife's decision.
Children will generally roll with it if you just communicate with them and don't treat them like they're stupid (not insinuating anything of course, but as a parent you problably know the little buggers are like bloodhounds in that regard)
Waiting will only make it more painful for her.

 Why drag it out? In fact, It'd problavly be easier for the children to grow up with their mother that way instead  of knowing about it because all that time and problaby supporting the mother the whole ride while she's not doing anything so she doesn't compromise their upbringing?

Utter poppycock if you ask me  let her be her and let the children have the parent be who she wants and needs to be.
Your mother can go pound sand. It's not her call to make, and she's being ignorant.

It's best for your kids if they have two parents who love them and are generally happy with their own lives and being true to themselves. Kids can understand a transition if it's explained to them in an age-appropriate manner, and it's great if they learn young what ""transgender"" is and that it's not something to hate or fear.

Being true to oneself, in particular, is something it's HUGELY beneficial to model for one's kids.

(my sister and I met our trans aunt and were told that she's trans at about 13 and 8, respectively. We didn't get scarred for life by the experience, or confused beyond what a little Q&A could resolve.)
If the parents are scared they should at least let her start hormone blockers. That way she won’t be exposed to too much testosterone when she doesn’t deserve to, and later change her mind if she grows out of it. (Assuming she’s amab)
Your spouse should transition whenever she's comfortable! And if anything, it will be harder for your kids to accept when they are grown compared to now because they'll have known your spouse as one way for much longer.
Our kids were 3 and 5 when I started to transition.  There was no confusion whatsoever.  In fact, I think the younger the kids are, the less “confused” they’re likely to be. Just be sure to devote extra time to connect with them when you explain the transition (i.e., devote a whole weekend to getting close to them) so they can really feel that they’ll always be loved and that will never change.
I think your mother should not have an opinion on your partner’s transition
Thank you everyone. I knew in my heart that she is being homophobic and hatred. ""If you are so accepting of everyone you need to accept the trumpeters"" I laughed and said no I don't but if you keep your mouth shut I will never know you are a bigot. My mother doesn't keep her mouth shut for anything. She will voice her opinion. makes me wonder if my grandparents are rolling over in their graves.
I came out to my kids recently and regret waiting so long. They were really cool about it. My daughter(15) smiled and said 'Oh ok, what are your pronouns.' 

So much time wasted feeling shitty, being angry or telling them off more than was necessary. 

My kids are happier and we have a better relationship now.
Where is the logic in specifically setting a false impression of yourself for your kids entire lives just to transition when they are grown? Not a knock on people who aren't ready until later in life, but if you are ready to transition, and you are going to do it regardless, why should you arbitrarily wait until your kids have grown up? It's the things you hide from kids when they are young that they will be ill equipped to handle later. It's people who grow up with trans identities being stigmatized that grow up to be transphobic, kids who grow up knowing openly trans people never have an issue.
your spouse should be there true self for both themselves and the kids
Transition when your spouse wants to transition. This has nothing to do with children. This has everything to do with her happiness. There is no argument here. I don’t want to disrespect your mother but that way of thinking is very harmful. It is harmful because it displays a judgemental way of perceiving others. The children should learn to accept people as their true selves, not what society deems fit for acceptance. It’s also harmful for your spouse if your mom is showing that she is not supportive of the transition as your spouse may feel that they are then forced to live as someone they are not. I believe it to be a very confusing time and one that should be supported with love.
Faster the easier for your kid
I transitioned when my neice and nephew AND my husband's kids were young, maybe 3-5 years old. My sister-in-law had the same concern about them being confused. They told my niece and nephew as soon as I started transitioning - it took a few weeks but they eventually got it and all was fine. We didn't tell my husband's kids until this year (they're 12 and 14) and they didn't care at all. 

Long story short, kids don't care. It's all about the adults' perceptions and assumptions. Do what makes you and your family happy and your kids will learn that they should do whatever makes them happy. <3
My kids are 8 and 12, and they were the most supportive out of pretty much anyone other than my partner.  My 8 year old just said thats ok, i just want you to be happy and have your inside match your outside.

I have some words for your mom...
Who cares what your mother thinks? Is she paying your bills?
Short answer: I would tell your mother, as politely as I could, to back off and leave it up to your spouse. That is your spouse’s decision, not hers.

Long answer: I have a trans woman friend who is  in a nasty, terrible situation where her mother manipulated and told false information to her ex. I won’t go into much detail but I start seeing red when I see this stuff because she’s the sweetest woman and she’s hurting because of what a parent did to her.

It is not your mother’s place to even speculate on or share her opinions. It is your spouse’s. 

I’m glad you’re supportive of her, it seems. Keep sharing that with her. My personal advice: The best thing you can do to help, as a cis person, is tell people when they are out of line and need to stop so that she doesn’t have to. It can be exhausting.
Dude, kids are kids, they won’t care if your partner transitions. Hell, I’d say it would be easier for them if you did it while they’re younger, so the kids grow up and when their memories are more solid, all they’ll remember for sure is their mum, it’d make it easier for them to digest. I wouldn’t sweat it.
Fuck your mom.
This is something you and your partner needs to decide and proceed on your own. 
You sound so supportive and your children will be as well. Much like you, I'm sure seeing their parehappy is far more important. 
You should also visit r/mypartneristrans you will get more support there💖
They should transition when they want. The earlier they start the easier time they will have.
I'd say she should transition when she wants to, will probably make her much more happy and it's not like transitions are some kind of adult secrete.
She should transition when she wants to plus doing it earlier than them turning 18 kinda makes explaining it to your kids a bit more easier because they're not little assholes who've been completely tainted by outside hatred
Okay. I see red when I read about Mom’s being dicks  to their own children who need to transition. 

This…”quality person” thinks she gets to tell a grown ass adult she doesn’t share blood with what they can do with their own body?  It’s none of your mom’s fucking business!

You support and love your partner with their transition 👊🎉
kids are incredibly understanding and will be much happier if both parents are happy, dysphoria could have heavy mental impacts on your spouse which may in turn effect your kids, she should transition in her own time not when others think it’s right
Your mom has no say in this because it's not her life.Just stick by your spouse and support her through her transtion(that may even mean cutting people out who don't support her.).I read one of your comments saying your mother thinks it'll ""confuse the kids"" but I promise it doesn't.It's a different situation but when I came out, I came out to 4 kids who knew me as female before.Their ages were 2,4,4,6 and 5 years later none of them are confused.Kids are kids and all they want is the people they love to be happy.Just tell them it makes their parent happy and they'll understand.Good luck to you and your spouse on this new part of your lives!
Short story short, your mom can fuck off. It's none of her business. Your partner should transition when they feel ready. How your mom feels is firstly, irrelevant, secondly, fucking transphobic toxic garbage.
See, short story kept short.

ETA: My partner is a trans woman and our son has never been confused. Not once. He is now almost 17.
Hi. My husband stated his transition about 2 years ago, and our kiddos are now 16 and 13. The kids didn't take long to adjust. Take the time to have frank, but age appropriate,  conversations with them. Let them ask questions and it's okay not to have all the answers. Having unanswered questions will lead to more conversations later. As for the parents request; you do what's best for you, your partner and your children. Love wins.
Your mom needs to stfu and educate herself. Sorry not sorry.
kids are really more flexible than you think, waiting to transition till their older will probably cause more trouble as it will cause them to feel guilty/make them think transition is shameful/unfit for children so my advice is to transition while they’re younger and use it as a teaching moment of self acceptance and the trans community, heck you might help your kids if one of them is lgbt themselves :), I just realised that it’s your mom that’s worried- short answer, that’s really fcking messed up your mom needs to grow up and stop being lowkey transphobic
Tell your mother thanks but no thanks for her opinion.
The parent's mental health is important since it affects the kids too, better just transition, it's not hard to explain to a kid and the kid grows up more accepting and more decent person, if the parent is caught up fighting with their own mental health like dysphoria or depression the kids might start feeling like they should take care of themselves as the parent is emotionally unavailable and that is the real thing that fucks up kids' mental health. Your spouse should transition when she wants to.
Your mom should but out; it’s not her life
She has the right to transition whenever she wants.
Leaving it will make it worse. Kids are young and move on fast, transitioning now will mean they spend more of their lives knowing your spouse as their real gender. It's less confusing, and really this is  just your spouse's mother's anxiety about her child transitioning. To be real blunt, not transitioning affects so much of a person's life and sense of self and ability to be happy ( a lot of the time) that that's a real stupid reason for someone to tell someone else not to transition
Waiting just amounts to more time in pain. That’s a super transphobic thing to say… how would she feel if someone said to just wait for cancer treatment until (enter arbitrary point in time here)?? Unacceptable 😒
Kids seem to deal with it way better than adults. I've seen many a story of adults being pricks to trans people, but much much fewer about kids.
Fuck what your mom thinks
I started when my kids were 3 and 6 and they didn't have an issue understanding and it helped my oldest to connect with me more. Especially after I told her we will have the same middle name.
A happy parent is a good parent :)
Also it's rlly none of her business when or if your spouse transitions
My own mother has said this to me on a couple of occasions. 
""But your boys are going to get bullied and made fun of at school,  just wait until they are 18.""

And I'll be almost 60 🤦‍♀️ If I could hold out that long.
What does your partner want? What will make her feel supported and therefore allow her to be more present, attentive, and loving with the kids?
Like I get it's your mom but she is being transphobic by saying something like that, I'd be furious if I were you. The ""it'll confuse the kids"" argument is one the most bullshit arguments I've ever heard - kids are pure, they can accept and handle things like that better than most cishet adults unfortunately
Would your spouse being miserable, possibly suicidal and full of self hate make a good partner and help make a good environment to raise children? I don’t personally think so. 

Your spouse being happy will lead to a better home environment for everyone
Transitioning makes people happy. Happy people raise better kids. 
Why wait? 

Over simplification but still
She should transition as soon as she feels ready! Transitioning is not something inappropriate for children and I think it would be good for your kids to be exposed to positive queer role models. It will help them understand how to be compassionate to any queer or gender non conforming people they meet and boost their confidence if they end up being trans themselves. Good luck, and congrats to your partner on coming out and starting her journey of transitioning!
My 3 year old understands and supports my transition- she still calls me “daddy” because I’m her bio-dad and that’s fine with me- she’s my kid she can call me king fuzzymitts for all I care! Point being your mom has no clue what she’s on about and is likely projecting her own concerns onto your children. There are plenty of resources such as children’s books addressing the topic and if my 3 year old can get it I’m sure your kids will with some time! 💜
In my first-hand experience, kids are totally fine with it. It’s the older people that can sometimes have a harder time.
Teaching kids that queer folks need to hide themselves ""for the good of others"" is about the worst possible thing you can teach a kid. This is doubly true if any of your kids are LGBT themselves.
Oh, god, no, she shouldn't. The sheer pain and humiliation of waiting for years to transition? I can't imagine living like that. She should transition whenever she feels ready, and not a moment before or after.

Good on you for your support, though! Your response is absolutely correct -- you just want to see her happy.
I think your spouse should get a say, but your mother shouldn't 🤷🏻‍♀️
Your mother's advice is irrelevant to the timing of your spouse's transition. It sounds like it is based upon a judgment that it will harm your children. Whatever hardship they may face, it will not be lessened if they are adults -- it will just be different -- and maybe worse! I am a transwoman transitioning with two children in the house who are 7 and 10. My wife and I are staying together. I choose to see my transition as a possible benefit for my kids. They get to see their parent express incredible courage; they get to grow up knowing that they will be loved no matter what -- regardless of any identity uniqueness that comes up or error they may make. And they're going to make amazing allies for their friends in school. I think having a trans parent is an asset.
If you two aren't planning to conceive more children, the sooner your spouse transitions, the healthier she will be. Your kids will understand, but your mom may have to catch up. Hang in there <3
""my mother thinks\[...\]"" well I think that's none of her damn business, no offense to you via insulting your family
It kinda sounds like you already have it figured out. Let your spouse do what they need to in order to be happy. 
Your family can be full of a bunch of different kinds of people but as long as you're all happy that's all that matters.
F*ck what your mum says, trans people are not confusing to kids and not something to hide away from them either. Tell her to ignore your mother.
I'm such a better parent because I transitioned as my kid grew up. It showed them that they can talk about their identity and pursue their happiness.
My kids are 5 and 8 and they are totally cool with it.  It’s the adults you have to worry about.
Hmm. Don’t wait for your kids. Do it for yourself to be a better you for your kids. Do it for your kids.

Hope this makes sense.
Lol, my mom told me that same thing about my transition.
Ima keep it short an blunt

If she doesn’t transition it can lead to health problems as well as mental problems that will worsen
Children are remarkable for their ability to adapt. Having a child grow up around someone transitioning will teach them empathy for others and the critical thinking needed to put themselves in someone else's shoes when speaking to them. This will make them better, more caring, more loving, and happier adults that impact their communities in positive ways.


This does not mean there will not be challenges. All change comes with challenges. That is what family is for. To help each other overcome those challenges and grow because of them. 


Telling your spouse to wait is just a tactic to save face. Tell me, would you rather have your children grow up with a spouse full of self hate and doubt? Or one with love and confidence in themselves. Both those options will impart lessons on your children.
I'll just add to what so many have already shared at this point, but holding off on transitioning isn't good for anybody. I started in my 30s with two sons, and not only were they obviously fine, but my own personal growth over the last several years has made me such a better person, parent and partner for my wife.

There's always some request to just ""wait until"" something, we had these discussions as well. My wife originally thought it best to wait until the kids were older, my parents wanted me to wait until grandma died. I'm so, so glad that I moved ahead, for everyone's sake.
Why does your mother think she gets a say?
Kind of a novel, sorry! 

My heart really goes out to you: realizing I was trans was such a terrifying/mind bending revelation for me and the anxiety of it all haunted me for months before I even began to process it. 

It didn't seem to hit my family as hard, as everyone I came out to was supportive, but I imagine, especially with a spouse, it can be a lot to take in. If your spouse is asking you when you think they should transition, take their question to heart. 

Think about it, think about why you personally would want to go forward with it or why you would wait. They're lucky to have a spouse who is supportive and willing to learn, and neither you nor them need all the answers now. There's no rush. There's no urgency. You're on each other's team, and you'll figure it out together.

 Personally, once that shelf broke for me, it was very hard to pretend things were normal. It took a lot of bravery and leaps of faith. I'm a cautious person by nature, but you kind of have to start taking steps right away or the sudden agony of realizing, of letting it out into the world, can start to eat you alive. There are trans helplines that can give you resources like the Trevor project. 

As far as *when* your spouse should transition, as far as how it will affect your kids, I know that my niece, who is loving and beautiful (but very young) stuggled with understanding how a boy could become a girl. My sister and her husband are allies and they work on it with her, but she's a kid and I just have to extend her grace and love because she's already internalized a lot of society's messaging about gender. 

Unfortunately, the strain it may put on your family does need to be a consideration, but with the right mindset and love, it doesn't have to be a world ending event. You're the parent, your spouse is the parent, and you'll make the best decision you can for your kids and your family. 

At the end of the day, I'm not in your position, so I don't know for sure, and as a trans woman, it's not easy to guess who will be supportive and understanding off the bat, who will need time to come around, and who will flat out refuse to be supportive. Kids are resilient and they can take big changes gracefully if they feel loved and supported, but you know your family's needs better than anyone else.

My only advice is to keep your needs in mind too, and make a decision from the place where you want things to happen. It's kind of selfish, but being honest with yourself in the short term, even if it's uncomfortable or politically incorrect, will make the long term play out easier.

I hope this helps and I'm sorry you're facing down such a monumentally scary event, but I'm happy your spouse has figured this out. I personally know what a weight it is off your shoulders to finally understand yourself like that, to finally feel light, to feel excited to move forward into a life, body, and role that feels natural to be in. Focusing on on that joy and relief helps keep things in perspective when you have to make these hard decisions.

Thanks for reading!
I agree that to start transition now and guid the children threw it make it a positive thing for the whole family
This is a fun topic for Trans Parent Day.
I started transitioning a couple years before having a kid (we froze the little buggers). We now have a 3 month old and he loves his two moms. We have met a ton of other queer couples in our neighborhood and a even a couple that had a kid a few weeks after we did. It has been a wonderful journey and has made me happy in a way I have never been. I never wanted my kids to meet the depressed version of me. I existed in the VOID and I would have never been able to feel like I can know. Good luck to you on your journey:)
I started transitioning publicly when my son was 5 and he didn’t get affected by it and thinks it’s amazing that he has two moms now.
However, do explain it to your kids.
They will be suprised.
Children are actually really accepting and surprisingly understanding. The haven't had time to fully develop stigmas. 
I lived with my niece at the start of my transition (she was 9 at the time) and my psychologist said try to include her in my transition, make up together and painting nails and ask on. Helped a lot.
Not so sure the advice or comparison  is directly relatable but the general notion that kids will be fine with it is the same ^^
Happy parent, happy kids.
A spouse transitioning isn't a traumatic event for kids. There aren't any massive changes to their lives involved. It's not a divorce. If anything, kids being a part of it will grow up to be more open and tolerant. I'd even argue that it's easier on them when they're younger.
As a gay male if my spouse wanted to transition to female it would be bye bye…you’re no longer what I want and quite literally negate what it means for me to be gay..it’s the same if a women transitioned to a man…I don’t see them as a gay man…it’s not hate….it’s simple what it means to be gay
Not your mothers circus, not your mothers monkeys.
Being trans isn't something that's inherently inappropriate for kids. It's actually probably going to help the kids out, long run. Having exposure to change and diversity young is really important.

I hope your wife is happy and that your kids grow up to be wonderful people, OP.
I agree yasuho
I got told by my family to wait ti 18 to make that decision, which i think is fair, om 17, he told me that on april when i asked if i could get therapy regarding that topic, he also said ""i dont think youre trans"" and ""i think its a phase"" both in the same day i told em i was possibly trans. Its november and i still dont have a therapist.
She says she is looking out for the kids mental state. Because it will confuse them.
OMG yes.  The kids already know more than anyone thinks.
Pretty much the same for me. For the first 4 years of my child's life I was pretty terrible as a partner and parent. My wife has noticed a 180 since admitting it to myself and others and an even bigger positive switch since starting HRT 2 months ago.
Right! My daughter came out last year and my mother's respond was ""it's like losing a loved one I need time to process this"" and I'm like WTF this is your granddaughter. How about support her and love her like you claim.
She is always into everything. She thinks she is looking out for the kids.
Wow, that's a new one for me. Pretty toxic.
She is always like this and it's like it's our lives let us live it.
She feels she is looking out for the kids. Spoke with her yesterday and again we got into it.
Fr I woulda loved to have parents that understood how this stuff worked instead of the half hearted “oh I was bisexual in college so I won’t disown you but I think being trans is weird” response I ended up getting from my mother and the complete lack of reaction from my father
>Having exposure to change and diversity young is really important.

So much this. It took me so damn long to figure out that I wasn't a man in part because I was never exposed to the idea that that was a possibility. I was, however, deeply exposed to the idea that being queer is wrong undesirable, among other hateful ideas and bigotry. 

I wish so much that I could've just had any sort of diversity around me instead of the homogenous straight, white evangelical Christians filling my head with insidious lies. Who knows, maybe I would've been able to start puberty blockers or something.
I also agree
I mean I’ve had more troubles explaining it to adults than kids. And a lot of kids are just like “cool” and might have some questions but Like explaining their transition isn’t gonna like break your kids yk
Confusing how? They are likely to be a lot more accepting if they grow up with this than if they grow and then have it thrust upon them as adults.
It hasn't confused my 4.5 year old at all. We got some kids books that explain gender identity and they pretty much switched to calling me mommy immediately.

They now say they are non-binary which has confused grandparents... but meh.
This just means it confuses your mother
Kids are confused by everything. I can guarantee your kid will be more confused by algebra if you sit there explaining it for 4 hours than if you sit there for 30 explaining your partners transition and why its important. Children have spongy brains meant to absorb and learn. Waiting will be more harmful to them and your spouse. The sooner you tell them, the more mailable their brain is, the better they’ll understand and accept.
your mother is the one who’s confused, with all due respect. kids are information sponges, and getting to see someone transition in the safety of their own home normalizes that it is okay to be trans in any stage of life. your mothers mental state is the opposite. 

also, your mother (and everybody besides your SO, really) has absolutely zero say in how/when someone transitions. that’s up to the person transitioning.
That's actually a kind of homophobic statement used as for shielding oneself. It's understandable that given her age she's wary and not really open to accept that, but she should get 2 things:  


A) It's your spouse's and your life, not hers. Not of her business. Including your kids. So she should stay on her own things.  


B) As u/Gnome69420 said, kids get it easier than adults. It's just about one person deciding to be what they want and choosing to be happy. You only have to explain to them that sometimes you are born with a body and you simply don't feel like living under the gender identity you were assigned. It's up to you to build your identity, and this means you can dress as anything you want, feel like anything you want, and you can even change or not your body, depending on how you feel.  
Like... If people go through plastic surgeries in order to change how they look and feel ok with their bodies, why would it be wrong to change anything else?
Nah your mother is just buyung into some of the stories people make up to discredit trans people. It'll probably be less confusing if she transitions while they're young since they won't have their whole life time thinking your spouse is their agab
It confuses her. She's projecting. That's not to say she's a terrible person and you should never talk to her again, but yeah even if the spouse involved was her wife it still wouldn't be appropriate for her to decide when or how. She's still in director mode because she's used to having that kind of control in her children's lives. She needs to be reminded this isn't her decision gently but firmly and the only thing she needs to figure out is how *she's* going to react. The rest of it is in your and your spouse's very capable hands.

Edited to add- I'm the mom of a handsome (trans) boy- it took me a minute too even when I was completely okay with the idea academically. As soon as I figured out it was about my fear (for his safety, not punishment or what their neighbors might say- fuck them) and not his fear, things got a lot smoother. I have a soft spot for moms that are trying and I hope she figures her emotions out so she can help support all of you.
That’s literally ignorant hate speech.
She is projecting her own confusion onto your kids for sure! Kids are way smarter than people give them credit for, also way more open and accepting if we allow them to be.
A lot of things confuse children, that's how being new to the world goes for a while. Let them ask questions, give them honest answers, and it won't take too long for the confusion to be resolved. It's not harmful to children for them to experience confusion, ask questions, and get answers.
kids are incredibly adept at handling things like this. whats important is that you explain it properly and dont shy away from answering any questions they might have. whether your spouse transitions now, or in 5 years, or in 10 years, youre gonna have to answer the same questions.
As a aunt who started transitioning while her niece was like three, it has not effected her mental state at all
In my experience people who say this kind of stuff typically use “confuse” to mean “make less bigoted”
Everything confuses children, no offence but they know literally nothing until it’s explained to them or they see it happen if you explain it clearly and in a way that makes sense to them then they’ll go along with it, children’s brains are basically information sponges the sooner you teach them about this stuff the better cause they’ll learn and be more open to new stuff later in life
I wanna say I transition and all my little brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews weren't confused they're ages are 8,9, and 3. The whole family explained it and they learned and carried on,Like nothing ever had happened.
I am a trans feminine (mtf) parent to 2 kids, ages 7+9. I came.out to them at 4+6 and heard the same thing from my wife's family.


Being myself made us all happier, brought us closer, and taught them a great deal of empathy and understanding. It has been nothing but positive and hasn't been inappropriate, confusing, or negative in any way. Anyone suggesting it is inappropriate or not good for the mental health of children is instantly sexualizing this and transition is not a sexual thing except in the strictest sense. Happy to expand on that if it's not clear. ❤️
Your mom seems to be the only one who is confused in this situation
Kids adapt. What’s gonna confuse them is why your mother is saying terrible things about someone who is clearlier happier and more comfortable, and that’s the issue here
Kids adapt. My 5 and 6 yr old grandkids were discussing me this summer. One said “Papa is a girl.” The other said “No he’s not, he’s a boy but he is becoming a girl!” They love me regardless.
> Because it will confuse them

Most things confuse kids, and they turn out just fine. Nothing about them being confused is going to hurt their mental state...
I worked with young children as I transitioned. They were as a rule FAR more receptive than adults. Nobody was confused, not ever.
Does your mother watch FOX news, by any chance?
nothing that hasn’t already been said but only adults cling to held ideas and beliefs in a way that would make transition confusing.

when we explained it to my 4yo, he had a couple questions. after we answered them he was like “okay!” and carried on doing whatever he was doing. since then, other than slipping up occasionally, refers to me as his mom without skipping a beat. 

kids are already absorbing and accepting new knowledge every day, if they’re confused about something they WILL ask questions (because that’s what kids do).
Assuming your spouse is AFAB

""Mommy doesn't feel like a girl anymore and wants to be a daddy instead.""

honestly, kids are super understanding and if you tell them to call you daddy instead of mommy they mostly will. Again, I don't know what your spouse was born as, I'm mainly just projecting there.
my sister transitioned when my little brother was 5. all we had to do was explain what being trans was and he got it. kids don't tend to care that much, and honestly take it better than most adults do. your mother is wrong
it's really not that confusing
There should be a book or website or something? Scarleteen.com has trans resources. 

Kids are fine. They accept as normal whatever you present as normal. They want your partner to be happy..

Your mother has a problem and she's using the kids to manipulate you and your partner. You're an adult, time to stop living under your mother's thumb and stop making other people cower under her. Least of all your spouse who has been going through this journey her whole life. She IS a woman and always has been. This is just torture.
Adults are way more confused than kids. It will be great for the kids to see your spouse happy and free. ❤️
Being a kid *is* being confused.  Attempting to mitigate that by simplifying life into absolutes does them no favors long term.  Most people are cis; some people aren't.  This fact is a microcosm of life in general.  Teaching a kid to fit into the normal at any cost - which is the only real lesson that might be taught - means when they invariably discover the set of things about themselves that place them in the minority on that issue, they will be inclined to deny their own truth.  That's a road that only leads to self harm.

When the default state is confusion and the default response is seeking information, the *truth* is just as easy to swallow as a convenient lie.  It is only the adult - the *teacher* - who might struggle.  And when they struggle, it will be because they once accepted a convenient distillation of messy life into absolutes.

And when all is said and done, if the goal long term harm reduction, what kind of damage do you think will happen when they're adults and you have a conversation that goes ""I've known for a very long time that I needed to do this but I didn't for your sake?""  It's too easy to find the addendum ""because I didn't trust that you could handle it"" in between the lines.
This is a topical transphobic excuse. Teaching your children that trans people exist and what it is in a controlled environment and seeing what it’s like in a real life setting will make them more understanding, accepting, and knowledgeable about it.

The “wait until they are 18” line is an excuse. People who say that will always find a new reason that a trans person shouldn’t transition. She doesn’t actually think this for the sake of your kids. She just doesn’t want to confront something that makes her uncomfortable.
No. She's projecting. SHE'S confused. Boomers don't understand dick about basic psychology and they piss me off to no end. 

With a massive amount of love: STOP TREATING HER LIKE SHE GETS A SAY. She has 2 options: get ENTHUSIASTICALLY ON BOARD or FUCK OFF UNTIL SHE CAN. Christ knows she could probably use a shrink anyway so tell her in no uncertain terms that SHE'S the busted one here and needs to learn how to properly support family. 

Goddamn old people and their busybody bullshit, man...
Why do you still allow this woman around your family when she is so clearly trans-homophobic? Cut her ass out. Tell her that she can get therapy to deal with her trans and homophobia or she never sees your family again. Stop letting her do this shit to your family.
That's when you find out that their life is more about their comfort than their families well-being. It's an ugly thing, and I truly hope she figures it out. I had to cut off an entire branch of my family tree because protecting my son's mental well-being is far more important than their sense of propriety.
So shes homophobic and says she no longer views your daughter as her loved one and you are taking her views on your wifes transition seriously?
Your mother us wrong. And frankly it sounds like she is one who needs to be kept away from your kids.
No your mom doesn’t think that, unless she is absolutely unaware of herself. That’s just a justification to hide to her bigotry (or alternatively her desire to control everything).The hate comes first, then the justifications follow. That is bigotry 101. This is no different.
She's full of shit. Based on your other comments about her, she's looking out for HERSELF and her REPUTATION. 

Honey, this person sucks. Why is she in your life?
Ugh, the “I experimented once in college, so I can speak about LGBTQ+ struggles and how they’re over exaggerated”
My mom is one of those false ally liberal Karens and she misgenders me on purpose and has been mean to me about coming out, and my dad is one of those idgaf people so he says having a relationship with your mother is important so I can't live with him
I also also agree
True. My youngest is 7 and she loves dressing up her mother. She is more girly than I am so. Make-up, dresses are her thing.
There's this story I read one time about this trans woman, she was watching some kids and one of  them asked ""are you a boy or a girl"" the lady explained that she was in fact a trans girl to which the kid replied, ""Ok, cool. Do you play minecraft?"" 

Edit: I think I remembered it wrong lol
For realz; Kids > Adults any day! I told my 11, 13 & 15 year-olds this spring; their reactions:

- 15: I'm so proud of you and support you!!!

- 13: OK. I love you

- 11: Looked at me and listened, but never stopped eating their ice cream.

- Wife: Glowered and vibrated from the other end of the table.
This - my young nephews were hands down the most understanding and quickest to adapt of our extended family when my daughter came out.
Hell I’m not even out to my family yet and my 7 year old cousin legit stares into my soul and lays it out flat and tells me that I may look like a girl, but I’m actually a boy (I’m ftm but I haven’t said anything about being trans) and his little brother makes gay stuffed animal couples despite LGBT topics not being discussed around them. People often worry about “confusing” kids by talking to them about LGBT stuff but even when we’re kids our identity is innate. In my opinion not discussing these things as they come up and pretending like LGBT people don’t exist will be what causes children to be confused or even worse, cause them to think that something is wrong with them and cause issues with their self image.
Closed minded adults project their closed mindedness upon children or situations involving children, despite scientific evidence that the minds of children are much more malleable than an adult's
Oh the horror of open minded freethinking children!🙄😑
It only ‘confuses’ people who’ve grown up with homophobic and transphobic ideas drilled into them, and even then they could totally understand if they were willing to listen. It’s an excuse for transphobia disguised as protecting children
yeah now that I see this is a pattern, that’s a big yikes from me
This 10 billion percent.
She is only looking out for herself by saying she is looking out for the kiddos. She made that evident last night.
Holy shit it rlly irks me to no end. My mom literally tried to relate to me by saying they’d probably burn our house down if people found it if she was bi when I confronted her about her being transphobic af like that was of any relevance. I’m in a better place now tho far away from that nut, can’t say the same for my siblings sadly
[deleted]
That’s exactly my situation except my dad understands my mom is an unreasonable person and I think he just doesn’t understand it but definitely doesn’t oppose my transition. My mom loves to explain how victimized trans people are and how hard life is gonna be and idk if she thinks she’s gonna scare me out of being trans but knowing her that’s probably not far off. Pretty sure she’s a terf cause she used to give me so much shit about how easy life was for guys and now she sees me as a threat to her understanding of the world. Eh either way idc she can be a hateful little garbage person 200 miles away from me cause I want no part in that lol
I also also also agree
Yah your mom is sadly just projecting transphobia it would seem. There is absolutely 0 scientific evidence to suggest that having queer parents negatively impacts their children. In fact there is more science to support the opposite to my knowledge! It's important to show your children the different ways people are so that they can grow up to be more tolerant towards others.

Besides, there are more negative mental health impacts for your wife holding off on her transition that *could* potentially impact you and your kids. It's important that their mother's are happy and able to support them fully. Your children will adjust, don't let anyone downplay just how intelligent and empathetic a child can be!

I hope this helps you two!!! ♥️♥️♥️
This is the exact scenario with my wife and me with our daughter. My daughter was always very girly and my wife is very much not. Like she'll wear makeup to a wedding but that's about it. I on the other hand in much more girly. My daughter absolutely loves having a mother that she can do those kind of things with. My daughter was seven when I came out as well. She's nine now. It's had nothing but positive impacts on her. Aside from having a parent who's into some of the same stuff she's into now, I'm also much happier and less depressed so I am a better parent overall even in the gender neutral aspects of parenting than I was before.
Doesn’t sound like your youngest is confused at all. My 12 year old and 10 year old were just fine too. Grandma is just being a silly old lady.
Ironically was thinking about my conservative dad, and a friend’s conservative catholic mother
i wouldn’t say liberal…i’d say SJW mom
200 miles is 321.87 km
I'm not a parent myself but as the child of a parent with untreated mental health issues (primarily of the depression/anxiety sort) and similar but treated issues of my own, I definitely think it's better for kids to have parents who are addressing their own issues and living a life that doesn't make them miserable and depressed all the time. My mother's depression and anxiety caused me a lot of spillover problems, growing up. 

I know how much better \*I\* function with my chronic depression appropriately treated, in all aspects of my life. And it definitely would have been better for me to grow up with a mother who was that degree more generally functional. 

And while my mom's depression (and a large chunk of mine) isn't due to gender dysphoria, at the outward-effects level depression is depression is depression regardless of what causes it.
[deleted]
It really do be
Not only is it important that parents can deal with their issues, it's also just as important for kids to see that it's normal for people have issues they need to deal with and for them to have a good example of how to deal with them.
yeah i think i’d know that by now, but thanks for the sociology lesson. i wasn’t “decoding”. i was adding to the conversation. i am in the lowest part of the middle class and queer as fuck i know how white cishet high middle people act when they’re around us
Absolutely! Trying to pretend that everything is easy for you all the time does kids a great disservice. Visibly dealing with your shit in healthy ways so your kids can observe you as a role model for how to deal with shit is the best thing you can do.

The Men's bathroom is heaven	"So I'm trans(FtM) and I'm deep in the closet so I don't pass at all and today I ""accidentally"" went into the men's bathroom. My God was it beautiful, it was gross and nasty but beautiful. I felt so happy it felt right it felt like the place I was meant to piss and shit. It was truly amazing before being kicked out."	"Congratulations on your ""accident""! I'm so glad that you find the men's room so exciting and hope it continues to live up to your gross, pee-crusted dreams.

In all seriousness, though, euphoria from using the correct bathroom is really something, isn't it? It feels just right somehow. I'm glad you got to experience it and wish you many future visits.
I’m the opposite xd I was also surprised by how gross women’s restrooms are. I just thought they’d be spotless, smh. But it’s so validating!!! I feel awesome whenever I go pee in there, and it’s been almost a year since I last went into a men’s bathroom 😅
As an mtf, I don't get it, but I'm glad it makes you happy dude.
That's awesome bro. And yeah I can definitely relate to that, the mens toilet is gross but I feel so happy going in there :D
Smells SO bad and the floor is SO sticky. ugh See ya in there, mate haha
>It was truly amazing before being kicked out.

I apologise for asking, but who kicked you out?
I find it beautiful that us trans men can find such happiness and wonder in male experiences that cis men typically gloss over because they're so normal to them. Same with trans women and female experiences, I bet.

I'm happy you were able to experience this :] I'm looking forward to the day when I can use one
Aaayyy congratulations 🎉

That's a big step 💖
Tbh the womens washroom is gnastier. Theres blood under the toilet seats. Some women feel the need to stand on the toilet and pee from 15 ft above the toilet....
Using the proper bathroom IS good and proper and validating.  Keep it up! If you catch my drift...
You were kicked out, someone spoke to you! Wow im surprised.
mens bathrooms are horrible but euphoria >>>
Congrats on discovering the other side! I hope the smell wasn't too bad. I know that's what always got to me. That and a bunch of burly men shuffling about while I'm just trying to piss. (Turns out I was uncomfortable because I was very trans and very gay 🥴)
Kind of a weird observation but I get it! ❤️🌸
How can they kick u out and found out womens bathroom can be just as gross to lol
Both toilets are exceptionally gross. Such is the life of everyone using those places.

Congrats love, that's funny and I'm glad.
[deleted]
I love this.
I've started transitioning socially, and I don't feel comfortable going into the women's bathroom yet. When I've been wearing a skirt, and using the men's bathroom the atmosphere feels so hostile. Its something else.
Im so happy for you!!!!
I'm glad this makes you happy but I don't think any amount of gender euphoria could justify how gross the men's room is. The urinals always have piss under them and the toilets seats are covered in piss because people don't want stand in piss but then no one lifts the seat.
Why would you be kicked out? I find guys tend to not give a shit who's in there. I often used it before my transition
Haha that feeling wears off! The mens loos are disgusting! 

Yesterday I was hovering my ass over a loo that had piss all around the seat 🤢

But I guess I still get a little thrill out of using the correct toilets. 

Hope you are able to come out soon :)
Cannot imagine wanting to be in there lmao🤢  


The last time I went in the mens at the mall there was literally a giant turd laying out in the middle of the floor
Congrats guy!
Well, you have fun.

Personally, I don't miss seeing the puke halfway up the walls or shit in the urinals. 🙄🤢
İ wish someday i also find myself in women's bathroom accidentally:)
Glad you found your euphoria. As someone who has worked in a trade where I was in mens/womens  restrooms daily I can without a doubt say both are typically gross. However if I had to pick one overall mens would win the gross war, but I’ve been in some woman’s restrooms that won battles.
Lmao, I'm glad you love it, but a trans girl, I hate(d) the men's bathroom so much
Lmao- despite also being a man, I have been using my women’s restroom privileges….why must the men’s room be so disgusting
I have done this it is heaven
oh this brings me back to that one time i was staying back to work on my digital design work. the rest of the campus was very dark because lights were off. when i wanted to go to the shitter, i accidentally walked into the boys bathroom.
I have yet only been in one men's room since our bathrooms are mostly gender neutral except at big places (I live in Sweden) but it was heaven to me too. No one else was in there and it was a game convention or something so no one cared that I went in there.
Ew mens bathrooms are not it 🤢🤢🤢 (transmasc person)
As mtf I can say the men’s bathroom is uhhh… interesting. Smells like piss. Shit on the walls. Penises of sharpie all over. But the conversations are great
As a cis, heterosexual white male, I have strong feelings on this!
My feelings are as follows:
you should be able to use the bathroom you want, comfortably and without fear of anyone harassing you or making you feel unwelcome/uncomfortable.
Except for the first 2 months of 9th Grade, I used the Girl's Bathroom for the entirety of my HS Education, this was thanks to Order 768, Ministry of Education, Year 2017, which allows for trans students rights (Later replaced by Resolution 810 in 2021, which allows for Trans Students to have rights without parental consent), however, the first time I ever went into it, it was beautiful as well! So clean! And the other girls were so friendly about it too, it was generally an amazing and euphoric experience!

It continued being so for the rest of 9th Grade, then in 10th Grade, I was kinda used to it already
Dude that’s awesome! I worked for my campus services cleaning both men and women bathrooms. I’m cis, but it does give me this odd euphoria when I get to walk into both without question (with a spray bottle and cloth that is). Is this my nb awakening 🤔
Congrats!

I did not know that was a reaction one could have to the mens room, but congrats!
Aww hopefully you enjoy your pee crusted heaven in peace
so I just had to comment a smirk at this and say ""I guess the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.""  But yeah in total seriousness, I am super happy for you having that experience, you know minus the getting kicked out part, even if my own brain is going ""It's the men's room... heaven? men's room, heaven... men's room, heaven.... does not compute!!""
It’s just a bathroom relax.
if you like this, you should go to an old ballpark or sports stadium and check out the ""urinal trough"" lol
Interesting. I don't know what it is about where I live, but I'm a retail manager and have to validate bathroom cleanliness every night I work and the women's washroom is always a fucking massacre. Like, I don't know what they do in there, why they do it or HOW, but GODDAMN.
So, I've since realized I'm non-binary, but for 2 years I identified as ftm trans man. And I'm not in a place in my life where I have the resources to do any kind of gender affirming surgery or HRT. And because of my weight I've always found binders to be difficult to fit right. (Plus I'm not thrilled that I can't sleep in them cause if it were up to me, I'd only ever change my bra after a shower. I hate changing it any other time because *dysphoria*) 
So my only masculine attribute is my hair. 

So I knew I couldn't go into the boys restroom in a high school in Mississippi. 
And I was honestly relieved. which probably should have been my first sign of being nb lol. I dreaded the day I looked so masculine I couldn't pee in peace in a women's restroom. 
I think it's urinals. Cause I'm not *thrilled* to use a women's restroom but I highly appreciate the the sacredness of a stall.
Hey man,glad you enjoyed! next time just say you're a dude most dudes won't question it again. But there still bigots so
I get the same feeling in the ladies except it's clean and smells nice.
He have an all genders bathroom at my work, it's hella nicer than the gendered bathrooms so I always use that one
I'm happy for you! I do NOT miss it.
same thing with me, who knew one could get so excited over a shitter (my personal name for toilets)
One person's heaven is another person's hell lol
Dude what lol
way cleaner than the womens too!!
Ah yes, the fabulous sh!t covered, stinky, pissed on seats are just 👌🏻
That is one INCREDIBLY particular kind of euphoria (at least in my eyes), but hey, congrats!!!!
Sometimes the womens restroom can smell like zombie sex…
I hope you get to a place where you can express yourself more, I want to use the mens restroom but I’m too scared since I’m fairly young and I’m worried some creep might do something
congrats, mens bathrooms are disgusting and funny places, i hope you enjoy your time in them regardless
Glad you're happy with it. More than welcome to take my ticket, I don't think I'll be using it anymore.
The only bathroom i like is my own :o
This brings me joy😆
I remember my first time using the womens Bathroom at an Restaurant, after i set down someone just pulled on that door very aggressivly, paralyzed with fear i was just hoping its over soon cause i still sound like a guy so if i say that its occupied i probably will get kicked out (that atleast was my thinking at the time)
i am scared to go into the womens restroom what if someone judges me, i look like a guy
Yeah I've heard for years from my female friends how much dirtier and grosser female restrooms tend to be. 

Honestly besides some occasional pee on the floor, men's rooms are pretty clean
Yeah. Although I am not out enough to actually go in them in public, I work at a pool and when we clean the locker rooms it is almost night and day between men’s and woman’s.
Become an engineer... the women's is spotless in engineering buildings.  Wait, maybe that's not such a good thing.
At my school it was a 50/50, sometimes it was spotless, sometimes dirty, sometimes there was menstruation blood being used as graffiti, but regardless it was very euphoric for me to be in it for the first time in 9th Grade!
I was a janitor at a fitness facility in my teens/early twenties, and I can confirm that women's restrooms are definitely more disgusting than men's rooms. They'd always take twice as long to clean, and for whatever reason, the women at that facility tended to be a bit more loosey goosey with where their various excretions wound up.
The smell…it can be really really really bad…sweaty smelly coochi…eww.  That smell you can almost taste…🤮
Hovering…
Men's restrooms are worse. Guaranteed. Lol women's stereotypes are annoying ""spotless everything!!"" Lol. In all seriousness it really is something. It is so validating
I’m terrified of the women’s public restrooms cause I’ve seen puddles of pee it’s not new to me. I would probably faint if I saw a stall that looked like a crime scene with blood
Some guy, he was like ""you're in the wrong bathroom, can't you see the sign"" and I got scared so I ran out. guess it's not really being kicked out.
Same question.
It really is!! Being that it's my first time something not related to my agab.
For real. Most guys get in and out, never speaking a word or paying any attention.
I never thought I'd write them and thanks!
The bathroom was relatively fancy so the bathroom was bad but not that bad.
It was some old guy. He seemed very weird
And a giant Bronx Cheer to whoever kicked you out.
You shouldn't have to, but next time take a wing man or two.
Really gross tho
Lol indeed
The bathroom wasn't that bad and a lot better than the womens room
Voices suck. No speak only type
I've transitioned (mtf) however do not pass and it's true that walking into the women's room gives me some stomach flutters.  However, once I get into that stall and sit down I always feel much better.  

I've had occasional cis women give me the side eye however have never been challenged.  I think if you just keep your head down and 'stick to business' you'll typically be fine.  If someone ever challenges you, just stick with 'I'm in the correct room' and tell them to mind their own business.
It can be nerve-wracking the first few times. I was always afraid I'd get yelled at or one of those gun-toting bathroom warriors would storm in there to protect the womenfolk, but so far I've just been some woman taking a pee, just like anyone else there. When you decide to go for it, be safe above all else and maybe go in with a cis female friend at first. If you're afraid of being judged or yelled at (or worse) maybe hold off until you feel you're ready. I wish you luck!
I'm exactly the same but bc I'm still in school, it means I have to go to the toilet in school and bc they r cubicals I accidentally went in the girl 1, wow I felt so amazing yk
U should just do it and if anyone asks just death stare them and say ""I'm a women, or or girl whichever"" and then walk out or do whatever n ye that's what I'd do if I were on a school trip in a theatre or something
I have not found this to be true at all. Maybe it's a geographic thing? I'm midwestern US and men's restrooms are /filthy/.
If I had to guess 'men's rooms' have less general upkeep as most dudes won't care and 'women's rooms' have more upkeep but are more likely to have someone do something outlandishly slobbish like having tiny pieces of tp all over the place for no apparent reason.

'Dudes' spend less overall time in there and do 'the business' then leave.
Just what the fuck is going on in women's restrooms if THAT is clean?
oh damn you are lucky

let me give you an example to what happened when i went in there

vandalism, toilets were stolen lol or destroyed most of the time
>sometimes there was menstruation blood being used as graffiti

wut
Hey, funnily enough, I'm in yr 9 rn and I went in the girls toilet for the first time. Wow it felt so euphoric.
I've cleaned both before. Men's restrooms tend to be worse, but they're bad in a very particular way (pee on toilets and floor). Women's restrooms tend to be cleaner, but when they're bad, they're *bad*. Piss on the toilet seat and floor from squatters, period products everywhere but the trash can, the occasional loose diaper or shit smear from someone who came in to use the baby changing station... It's awful.
Nah women‘s are worse. I‘ve cleaned both before as well as used both quite a bit.

‚Superficially‘ mens are worse if not cleaned regularly cause they’ll be full of piss.
However womens come close second in piss due to all the hovering and spraying everywhere.

However I’ve only had other bodily fluids in the women bathroom. Female hygiene products stuck the walls? Diarrhea thrown at the ceiling.
I’ve never seen anything even remotely similar to that in the women’s restroom, but anyways 😅😅😅
I work as a cleaner for a business I will not discuss the dealings of just in case, I've seen a lot on the womens bathroom floor and blood is not one of them
>""you're in the wrong bathroom, can't you see the sign""

That seems rather mean. I'm sorry you had to experience that.
I just hope you're not planning on using the men's room at school because those are hell.
If you're going to a gas station, expect it to look like shit TBH, I've seen quite a few good ones around here in the Midwest
PSA if you use * instead of / reddit will display the wrapped text as *italics*
I discovered this when traveling, but some places it's super not okay to flush tp down the toilet because it clogs the sewage systems, and it's customary to place the tp in bins next to the toilet instead. People will leave it on the floor if they can't find a bin.
Thats crazy

You gotta go to some really rundown areas normally to see that kinda thing

I've been going into the men's room for 30 something years and I've only seen what you described a handful of times
Don't ask how, but somehow they used it to paint the bathrooms, disgusting honestly. Luckily my first use of the girl's bathroom was not on one such occasion, I had the bad fortune several times to find that situation in the future across my HS Education tho
Nice! Was it a one time thing or is it permanent?
I did once. There are some nasty ass people out there.
I have. In a single-stall women’s room. I noped right outta there.
I have on multiple occasions unfortunately lol, it’s about as awful as it sounds. Also pee being all over the toilet seat, super gross.
Let's hope next time I pass
 why do I want tho
I know.

The / is more emphatic in my mind.
i was talking about one in my school
“Noped out of there”….😆
I bet you will. :)
I don't know!

don’t have a blåhaj but i have my emotional support ikea dog (also i got a night gown i’m v happy)		"I really want to pet the dog lol
so glad you're feeling happy, you deserve it 💜

(where is the pic inspired from? you look super cute, i wanna know)
You are my transition goals
I HAVE THE SAME DOG PLUSH!!!! Mine is named Stewart, lol
You look great in that night gown x
You look amazing 🥺
Here's my silver cause you spelled it right
Damn I need a night gown where the feck do I get one
Aw what a cute pupper! Definitely 11/10!
You are beautiful! I'm super jealous.
Lol I have the same plush. His name is buddy and I've had him for 15 years
pretty!!!!
I have the bear, and also i won a mini black and purple shark some years back and just realised it's the ace shark :P
AAA you look like young linda hamilton, i mean like as a compliment
Oof you are gorgeous 😗🙃
holy shit transition goals. 😍
omfg i just woke up YA’LL ARE SO KIND WHAT😭😭💖
sheesh youre super pretty
I can be your blåhaj if you need one I may not be a shark but sharks don't sleep because if water stops passing over their gills they'll suffocate and I don't sleep because I can't maintain a decent sleep schedule so we're actually quite similar if you think about it.

Disclaimer: This comment contains information that isn't quite true. While many species of sharks don't ever stop swimming so water can continue to pass over their gills they often do go through short periods of time while swimming where they appear to be resting. While this would be significantly different than human sleep I am not the sultan of sleep and can't make the call as to what actually constitutes sleep. I'll leave that call up to the actual scientists.
you are beautiful and an inspiration.
YOU ARE SO GORGEOUS OMG !!!
I HAVE THAT DOG TOO, i named it merrie :D
You couldn’t possibly be any cuter 🥰
If I had 1€ for every pixel in the image I could probably buy a McDouble
Where’d you get the night gown? I’ve been looking for something to be dramatic in while I attend to my evening routine
Whattttt you look absolutely stunning!! And I love that night gown, I wish I had one like it🥰🥺
when I tried to get a Blahaj they were sold out, so I got a cuddly Ikea wolf instead and it makes me happy.

Until my dog tries to steal it during the day.
All stuffies are valid!
You are absolute goals 😭
Pretty!
You are so pretty I want to cry
You look so pretty
Since 'blåhaj' means blue shark in danish and swedish (maybe also norwegian?), i had to Google it. Turns out it's actually just a blue shark. An adorable one at that

Edit: Also, you look very cute
Oh! You're cute :D and love the plushie <3
Actual transition goals ❤️
I have the same dog just the older version. Everysince I'm 5.
Great body in the nightie
Tbh it's better than a real dog. They provide the same emotional support. Only the real one requires a lot of work to care for and eventually leaves you.
You watch OT and click too? Or no?

I am so sorry but I thought that the picture was referencing [this](https://youtu.be/mxr6COyjD1o) horrible song and music video and have been dying of laughter

Not my cup o' tea but pretty good
Well then, I hope you like shark facts because I don't know many more and I'd love to hear some from you

Yay! I'm glad it's sunny out now. It was a pretty dark and wet winter where I'm at.

I basically just started HRT (two days ago). If I can look half as good as you, I'd be over the moon! I'm so happy for you, sis!

I just got called ma'am by random strangers twice today. Really happy about it pre everything		"Yay, that’s the best feeling!
Enjoy that euphoria, girl!!
Yay a win for all in the trans community and a win for you!
Your body looks amazing! Did you do lots of exercise?
It's def a validating experience that's for sure!!

I was replied ""have a nice day ma'am"" at the drive thru when I was barely trying, but I guess was hard to see my glaring 5 o'clock shadow over my Tiffany blue nails. I was pretty happy about it!

I'm brand new baby so my dumb ass just went ""thank you!"" in my booming man voice and I actually laid down in a coffin inside my car and someone sang Amazing Grace while I disappeared into the very soil beneath me.

I male-failed for the first time on Saturday and I’m still floating
Ride that high homegirl!
Best feeling ever!
Omg, girl that is like the BEST FEELING. I love getting called ma'am or lady (though its mostly followed by ""oh sorry, sir 😓)
That’s amazing miss!! You deserve to feel that happiness girlie :)
Oooh thats dangerous. I’m military and calling women ma’am is pretty common. But i’ve caught alot of shit from civys about it inferring age.
Epic, I loved how happy I felt when my teacher called me by my Preferred name last week
The first few times it happens is such an amazing feeling.
That’s one of the best feelings ever to me. I love having random strangers call me “sir”. It’s happened rarely, but it’s still awesome when they do call me sir!
oh fuck yeah, that never happened to me pre-everything, and i was wearing makeup everyday with my nails done! good job
Alot of my costumers called me ma'am too. Its great we're amking progress
Yeees!!!
Oh geez that just is so awesome.😁
I do. It makes me smile uncontrollably
Not really. Just good genetics. My body has known I'm trans longer than I have
I got called sir multiple times today but I only focus on the two times I was called ma'am and that's how I stay happy. Have a nice day ma'am 😘
Thank you 😊
Doesn't change the fact that I love being treated like a woman. Plus in my country it's pretty customary to refer to customers as ma'am or sir, same with strangers as it shows a sign of respect
That sounds amazing
The first time for me happened a week ago but I didn't post about it
I don't even wear makeup yet
I always tell people that, not dysphoria, is what unites us.
Lucky!
HA i feel that entirely, i’ve always had a feminine butt, hips, and thighs, and i always enjoyed that, but it used to make me uncomfortable. now though, i realize how lucky i am
[deleted]
It really was, my friend was so happy for me
congratulations! 6 months on estrogen was around the time i stopped getting misgendered lol
That's really sweet
Yeah but I still struggle with my weight
Me too, I’ve been bless with by the big butt gods
Yeah I remember I was really insecure about people seeing my waist because I felt really insecure but now I consider myself blessed
Happy to share the love 😘
BTW this was so sweet you made me tear up 🥺🥺
I can imagine
I still get misgendered a lot but more and more I'm getting gendered correctly
Got it from a tumblr post by thatse-corvid-core-babey;

‘i’ve said it once and i’ll say it again. EUPHORIA is the greatest identifier of a trans person. not dysphoria. dysphoria is hard to define and thus it’s hard to regulate what is and isn’t dysphoria. but euphoria? that feeling u get when someone uses the right pronouns? that “i can’t contain my smile” sort of joy? THATS what the trans experience is all about. that’s what unites us’

I saw it on a video by One Topic who is a great lgbt ally. I love this quote and read it a lot at the very beginning of my transition...

Edit; added op’s tumblr handle

Edit 2; Zomg! Thanks for my first Gold!!!
haha that’s so valid. i had an eating disorder years ago due to gender dysphoria and being in denial about my transness. this was in high school, and i was hating all the changes happening to my body. i just wanted to look feminine, so i lost a bunch of weight. close to my lowest weight, i really liked my waist, but of course i kinda decimated my hip fat by losing all that weight. still, when i was super skinny, i took a waist measurement and compared it to average waist circumference for cis women. my measurement shocked me, and i felt a ton of gender euphoria, but at the time i just didn’t see transition as a possibility. 

when i had and eating disorder, my waist was five inches smaller than it is now, and 7.5 inches smaller than it was before i started hrt. but i am SOOO much happier with my body now than i was then. i was so frail and tired all the time. i started doing worse in school. but now i love how my body feels and looks.

edit: oh yeah, something i was always embarrassed about it showing was my bare chest. i felt so awkward being the only cousin wearing a t-shirt to the pool. i felt like my chest was unsightly, when in reality it was completely normal for a *slightly* chubby preteen. yeah swimming made me so uncomfortable because the outfits were so gendered, and i couldn’t wear the type of swimsuit i wanted to. i guess i “got over” being shirtless in high school, when we had to swim in the pool for exercise with other students. i didn’t want a t shirt to drag me down, so i just said fuck it and stopped caring. i was such a loner, it didn’t matter anyway. 

jesus christ, i forgot how much i hated high school hahahaha
Thank you so much for sharing this. I'm going to show it to some of my friends who will definitely smile after seeing it
An analogy I like is this: Imagine that when you were born some sadistic Greek God decided to fill your body with weights. Your whole life is lived carrying these weights around and you don't know any different. You never discuss it with anyone because you just assume that everyone feels this way. You can move like anyone else because you adapted, it's harder for you than anyone else but you don't know that. Then one day the capricious deity that prescribed your fate decides to reverse their decision... And with the weights removed you feel like you can fly. For the first time in your life your heart is unburdened. That's what it's like to have mild dysphoria, to never know anything's wrong at all... And then finally feel comfortable in your own skin.
I didn't experience much dysphoria until puberty so up until high school I was a really good swimmer but I couldn't join the swim team because I didn't like people seeing my chest
... well... that’s honestly the best way I’ve ever heard to describe dysphoria. Someone said being trans is putting your life on ‘hard mode’ but it can be already on it. That weight you carry, hide, feel the moment you wake up - that’s what it felt like sometimes. I had wonderful dreams where I was born in the right body and they were amazing, but I woke up and the shock of reality crushes you. I missed school, work, important friends because I was suffocating. I’m so glad I finally came out. Hardships I have now are nothing compared to how it was..."	lv9p58	trans	1624	0.98	2021-03-01 13:51:18

“Hump day” is Wednesday- it’s considered the day in the middle of the “work week” or school week… think of the hump as a hill, and Wednesday is the top of the hill, and then you’re climbing down to Friday. 

It does sound dirty, though, and there are all kinds of jokes about the phrase on the internet
Hahaha it just means middle of the week!

HAPPY INTERNATIONAL TRANS DAY TO EVERYONE🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️		"Well I guess it's as good a reson as any to make myself come out today
Oh yes! I am MTF and telling two of my friends I am lesbian later today. 

Just to confuse them a bit more before coming out :D
There's a lot of you in the comments saying you're going to (try to) come out today.

To all of you, good luck and much love ❤️
Yooooooooooo *celebrates in shork*
Happy Trans day from a trans-parent (my son is trans). You are amazing and strong and loved! It takes so much courage to be your authentic self, even in the privacy of your own space! I'm so proud of you and you deserve to have an amazing day!!
This sounds like a day to come out.
Good luck to all the people saying they are gonna come out today❤️🏳️‍⚧️
To everyone wanting to come out today-- follow your hearts, my friends. 

To everyone who is not there yet--- today we celebrate you as well. 

I love you all.

I came out in 2014. I lived for 8 years as an out, non passing pre hrt trans man in rural TX

For some of that time I was a shut in bc I was scared to work/live in the outside world

Then I got a job at a gas station. Not passing is hard, and scary sometimes, but it also opened me up to a lot of support and solidarity. I didnt expect to meet a trans coworker where I lived. I didnt expect locals in my area to have my back and defend me (like in one situation where a customer called me a dyke and i told him to leave and he threatened to tell my manager and get me fired, a random middle aged very Republican customer stayed behind and left his number and said he would come to my defense). The world is not as black and white as it seems. Just by us living our best lives we show others that not only is it possible for them to do it too, but people see they have been lied to about what trans people are like by meeting and knowing all the different kinds of folks out there.

And if I was passing/stealth, at least 2 coworkers would never have come out to me. I went to work at a grocery store and a trans woman in her 40s came out to me and we began HRT together (she helped me find local resources). A 18 year old trans guy saw 2 trans people working at a grocery store in TX and knew it would be safe and applied. This got himself a car and out of an abusive household. 

Now I pass and honestly, in a lot of ways I miss being able to be immediately clocked by other trans people bc its led to so many local people coming out to me. And when a bunch of trans people know other trans people are around and even work together, we feel more confident to be ourselves and take no shit. And thats exactly why theyre trying to keep us afraid and in the closet. Because when we're out and proud we can find each other, and cis people can see we're just normal people, friends neighbors and coworkers, and not the boogeyman.
Happy March 31st!!! 🏳️‍⚧️☺️🥰❤️🏳️‍⚧️
MAY BLÅHAJ BE WITH YOU ALL TODAY. 🖤 You all are valued and appreciated. Thank you for sharing your stories, experiences, advice, and memes.
Happy Trans Day of Visibility to all of you beautiful people from an ally! My brother (FTM) has never been happier in his life since becoming his true self and I wish that for all of you 🏳️‍⚧️!
Fuck I’ve stayed up all night and might not have time to come out tomorrow. Fuck it ima try.
🥳Happy International Trans Day🥳

Guess I should probably come out to my family today!
Now it's time to decide how many trans flag accessories is too many.
🏳️‍⚧️Thank you you too! 🏳️‍⚧️A reminder for me to start looking for new countries to look for 😂
Already?! Why that’s fast?! Sorta depressing though, made little to no progress and I’m still my ugly self lmao
Wishing everyone a beautiful.
💕🏳️‍⚧️TRANS VISIBILITY DAY 🏳️‍⚧️💕
I was gonna come out today. Nope not doing it. Maybe by pride month
HANKS FOR TELLING ME I WOULD HAVE MISSED IT FOR THE 4TH TIME KSKSKSK
For all of those who chose to come out yesterday, you are very brave and I hope all went well for you. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
After the Trans school shooting I believe this post is very insensative. Coming from a proud TRANS!
❤️🏳️‍⚧️❤️🏳️‍⚧️❤️🏳️‍⚧️
WOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
I didn't even know this was a holiday. That makes my day better, thank you
I didn't even know it was trans day and I had my first gp visit about it lol
what sucks is i have to keep hiding even on this day sense i don’t have a supportive parent at all but all i really care about is having a supportive boyfriend and i’m glad to have him!
And I'm off today. Time to celebrate being me!
All stealth checks are made with disadvantages for the day. Sorry to all our Trans and Non-Binnary Rouges and Rangers.
Happy trans day to everyone 🥰🏳️‍⚧️✨✨
I came out to my classmates!! So far they’re generally supportive but some haven’t responded yet. Now for my teachers…
Love all my trans brothers sisters and siblings!!!
I came out today and I didn't know trans day of visibility even existed! It's good I forced myself to come out
To all my trans and nonbinary brother, sisters, and siblings of all identities, out or still in the closet, I love you. 

Be safe, but be you! 

Know that not every story begins at the same. So if you are old or young, it's never too late to come out.
Was today?! Oh no i lost my opportunity
You’re all so awesome. I can’t celebrate today, but I plan to be very visible for the next one! Live it up for me! 💖
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH
aye im gay 🏳️‍⚧️
happy TDOV to everyone 🥰
Yesterday was my birthday so happy late trans dayyy
Fuck... message me if you do. I'll do it too if you can
I hope it goes well!
Gonna try to do the same today! Good luck :D ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Do ittt!! I did 2 days ago at work.. it was scary as HELL but most everyone was supportive . And now I can just live as Me
Same.
If you do, let me know how it went. I'm only out to seven people right now. Luckily those seven people are the most important people in my life. Maybe I can be inspired, or at least live vicariously through you, because I can't say that I hadn't thought of it.
Me as well
Best of luck my friend!
honestly thinking the same.. I don't want to keep pretending
I kinda wanna do it too (to my classmates) but one of my teachers seems to be transphobic so Idk 💀
I hope it goes well for you!! I wish you the best!
I did to my boss, half my direct reports, another person at work, an old hs friend, my old hair stylist, and my possibly transphobic but not retired military brother in law...
Not me having your pfp as my lock screen years ago
It worked ... Sort of :D

But I am almost out to everyone now
I told my team via slack today was going to be my last day and logged out. Came in after Corp changed my domain account and all my other apps. The shock was just amazing.
I really liked your pfp lol. It's a whole another vibe 👍🏻
glub glub 🦈
Thank You!!
Very brave and should be celebrated. Lovely to see people being their true selves
Love this,been out a year now MtF and I wake up every morning with my Blahaj Shark feeling better and more confident then i did for decades of my life beforehand
Happy trans day to him!🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Good luck if you choose to, you are strong and got this!~
No amount is too many
Its never enough 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
That's okay, wait until you feel ready. No one can and should force you to do this until you are ready. :hug:
Insensative, how? Elaborate please
Sorry about your parents, things like this makes sad actually, why can’t all parents just accept their kid for who they are, luckily u have your boyfriend atleast🏳️‍⚧️❤️
Happy for you❤️
OK sure
I'm doing the last stage of coming out (at work) 6.5 hours from now.  You can do it!
You two both got this! Best of luck and well wishes!~
I hope everything goes well for you as well!
Update: I did the thing. They gave me their generic ""I don't like this, but I can't do anything about it"" response, so... Idk.
This is awesome, great for you!~ :hugs:
Haha that's pretty fun. We're they confused?
if you go to their comment history it is a lot of typical crypto currency talk and then just today posting comments about being trans. these comments tend ti come off as being judgemental over other peoples trans-related opinions. (though judgemental might just be the way i take because of my autism but yea) i think they might just be making provocative comments on these subreddits to get traction but i don’t know. this is all based on comment history though so maybe they are genuine. Though i think the comment on the trans shooter in the us is almost a giveaway for my previous statements. i am not sure how they can’t see that this is a great case of the bad apples of any community doing something gains a lot of negative traction. have a good trans visibility day op. :)
exactly he has been the only one who’s used my pronouns and my name i rlly wish my mum would understand but she never will because of what she believes and u can’t talk her out of any of it  hopefully everyone grows to learn to just accept people but who knows at this rate
You two both got this! Best of luck and well wishes!~
I'm already out at work. The only people I have left to tell is my parents. And, ngl, I'm pretty nervous
How did it go?
Thank you so much. Hugs to you too 🤗
Alot of people thought I quit and Emily was my sister. The confusion was awesome and when they got it they were all like ""oh....."" ""ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!""
❤️❤️
Heh, we were basically opposite order then... mine was friends, family, then work.  Work is the most terrifying to me.
It actually went great!  I'm surprised you followed up, lol.  It went way, way better than expected.  Lots of people interested and asking questions, did not notice any negative reactions.  I'm excited for moving forward!
That is hilarious 😆 I might just steal that idea
💖
I'm lucky enough to work at a place that's pretty progressive, so it never really scared me.
That's amazing to hear
I wish I had the strength to come out to my family right now, but I just don’t.
Yeah... I considered applying out for jobs, my workplace is fairly medium-big, but HR is progressive.  I'm just in a position where I was promoted way ahead of my years of experience, so any job I take would probably be a pay cut, even without considering transgender status.  So, we'll see how it goes.
It's OK, honey.  The more important thing is to wait until you're ready ❤️"	127cyuj	trans	1562	0.98	2023-03-31 07:01:37
Happy visibility day friends!		"I really love the design of this! Very pretty! 💙🩷🩶
Oh wow, your art style is so beautiful and soft!! And obvs, I love the piece itself.
Not a single one of my friends IRL or anyone I know wished me happy visibility day today. Not a big deal I guess most people don’t know. Just gets depressin sumtimes idk. Glad there’s ppl online that still appreciate us tho! Hope everyone had a great day! 💕
When’s trans invisibility day? I wanna be invisible for a day, I could annoy my boss
The Holy Sisters of Charity, School Sisters of Notre Dame and Saint Mary of the Woods have ALL decreed that ALL Transgender individuals :
“Are beloved and cherished by God”.
We will note that it takes our fellow Women to do this.

what a beautiful and fun artwork!
I agree it’s beautiful, but sadly it’s not my art, I found it on DeviantArt, but thought it was a great expressive piece to share today!
It isn't well-known at all. I wouldn't read much into that.
i’m not even trying. i’m reveling in that gender envy. new goals tyvm
So we're just ""psychopaths"" huh? According to your other comment. I hope you learn to have empathy for those who are different from you. It must be exhausting to hate on innocent people constantly.

We just want to live in peace. Just let us, is that so hard?
Ah no worries, I also appreciate anyone who admits that. Do you have the source??

Happy Valentine’s Day, hope you lot have a lovely one. My date ghosted me haha xD		"[deleted]
Well, if they were going off of looks alone, then they're blind because you are absolutely beautiful!

I'm pretty jealous tbh😡
You’re so cuuuute omg I love your makeup so much!
I’m sorry they did the love, believe me it is their loss. Big Virtual 🤗
You look AMAZING
You dodged a bullet!! Their loss. Good luck in the future to find that special someone!!!
Beautiful. Should never happen to someone as lovely as you. ❤️
Happy valentines day to you too.
I'm sorry that happened, but you look stunning
[deleted]
Feliz día a ti y a todas las personas del grupo, que pasen el día acompañados de su ser especial ya sea abrasados o en línea y también los que no tenemos viendo pelis 😉 cuídate 😘😍😘
Eff em! Your a damn queen and you slay all day everyday!
Fuck your date, you look beautiful today
That's fucked up.

Your makeup looks great though and you're crazy cute. Get at me later for consolation cuddles. 🥰
[removed]
(I don’t know your pronouns but) Damnnnn Gurl!

You are so beautiful and such a gift you make it look like it’s Christmas already 🎄❤️!

Stay strong Queen!
Stay safe out there! 
You are a gift, a very very attractive gift fam ❤️
That's awful 😑

It's their loss, I'd go out with you in a heartbeat!  Ofc that's just my thirsty lesbian ass acting up lol
What fool, what absolute buffoon, what insane troglodyte of a person would stand up someone so flabbergastingly stunning?
What a butthole! Id be early to that date. Youre gorgeous!
How about I take you out then? 🥺🥰
You poor thing. Their loss though. Seems like you dodged a bullet x
Sorry to hear that!!
Hope you are able to have a good day at the expense of them in the end!! 😤
You look beautiful 😍💗 so screw that date.
What absolute fool would ghost you??
Happy Valentine's day to my beautiful reddit friend
i love your makeup
Happy Valentine’s Day, beautiful. Clearly your date had something within themselves they didn’t like and were too scared to deal with like an adult. Remember to not take things personally and continue loving yourself!
He's misteak ur aboustly beautiful
Happy valentines day to you to gorgeous
You're pretty they're foolish
Ur stunning dear 🥺🖤
[deleted]
We've all been there, sister. They're an idiot for not wanting to meet up with someone so drop-dead gorgeous 💕
Ghosts are the worst!
This date of yours is a fool so don't concern yourself with them. Anyone who would ghost such a gorgeous woman is clearly insane.
O love how sweet your eyes look. I would never ghost you. To bad you are far away. 😍
Your HAIR OMG ✨💕
[deleted]
To ghost someone so majestic looking 🖤
Sorry to hear that
I got ghosted tonight too! :C Happy lonely V-day lovely
oh no! i'm so sorry that that happened to you :(
[removed]
No way. Your date didn't do that. He must have been injured and is in the hospital because I can't see why any sane person would ghost you. Oh they're crazy. That's it. Definitely thier loss. Hell where are you I'll take you out.
Who the fuck would ghost u
His losss
Their loss, you’re beautiful!💜
That's worse than me, they gave you the illusion and hope of something whereas I actually had nothing and still have that
So sorry! Happy Valentine’s Day.
Their loss hun
I hope he/she/them see this picture and regret the decision made for the rest of life 🤣
Happy valentine's day to you, gorgeous; from a forever single❤️❤️
wtf you’re beautiful you don’t deserve that crap >:( drop the @
Love the makeup roses are pretty, not as pretty as you though.
Relatable
nooooo! how could someone ghost you! agh i hate people who ghost! still tho! i hope you had a good day!
A sheer idiot for sure. You look amazing honey 😘
That sucks ..keep killing u are dope
I feel ya. Same thing happened to me... Four times in a row
That's nice.
I remember one quote of 'shawshank redemption' about hope whenever i feel hopeless.
Happy Valentine’s Day That’s terrible. Then your date wasn’t worthy of you.
Who in their right mind would do that to a queen like you, that's just not okay. It's their loss. Sending hugs if you'll have them!
[deleted]
He's a douchebag! Your absolutely gorgeous

“Hope is a good thing..” I love shawshank redemption I may watch that tonight or sometime soon been so long since I’ve watched that! Morgan Freeman ftw x
That hope is a dangerous thing? Seems kinda destructive imo
Happy Valentine’s and aw thank you x
Aww thank you /hugs back! 🤗
Literally had 9 arranged daters (given them more than one chance) out of the 9 people 1 person has shown up I’m bi I look literally for both male and female companions. I used to be a big skater kid so I need to get back into that right now I’m slightly boring on the hobbies can’t even game due bad internet which was league of legends and ff14 xD

Haha still v cute 💕💕💕
It's my pleasure beautiful
I did tinder for a while a few years ago and it hurt me more than helped. The biggest lesson I can take for it is that I just need to let the love find me :) you can't hurry a true and solid connection! Best of luck and I hope you find someone soon!
Welcome 😊
You're welcome.
[deleted]
You are most welcome chicka! Now you just gotta take a crap ton of selfies of you being a bad bitch to show what they missed out on!
Omg A Queen Replied to Me! ❤️❤️
Especially today 😥
“Troglodyte” just has such a punch to it, i love that word so much
Can’t EVER go wrong with that!! 😉
I feel you. I was ghosted recently too. Water off a duck’s back, right? It only makes us more resilient.
You're welcome.
[deleted]
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Well you are really attractive in this photo, you deserved the upvotes 😊
Thanks but God's plan is something else maybe.
Thank u
Yeah you too~
Nope.
Hope is a good thing.
That's what morgan freeman told to andy with fear, disappointments in his mind.
You are very welcome. Have a wonderful day.

Thanks ❤️🌹❤️
Aww thanks, yeah been single for two years now guess the boredom of it all plus lockdown isn’t great for the mental health xD although lockdown made it easier coming out to my family and a few friends xD
Thank you, you made me smile ❤️. Just sorta makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong xD but I get it sometimes it’s just because people have second thoughts :P
Haha xD
Yeah I guess haha the day us lonely hearts see how lonely we are xD
Haha yeah may have to become my go to insult xD
Yeah whenever I hear of that saying I think of ins monsoon from ru Paul’s drag race xD but yeah so true ❤️
Awww cute
Aw thank you 😊
Maybe we’re meant to parent cats! I’m sure we’ll both find someone soon. Hopefully after lockdown it may also be easier. Kinda hard to not feel lonely with lockdown x
Is it the one where Dupfresne say they can't take hope away?
Thank you and you too x
Ha probably the case but I’m rather open but like the ghosting is random. We’ll be talking fine then the next morning or after me saying “brb shower I’ll let you know when I’m back” no response in the ghosting just it was literally us talking about carrots... haha random I know to put in context they’re vegetarian and I’ve until then not ate a carrot for 19 years (apart from once when I had them in a katsu curry).... that sounds really random I know... then they replied with a bugs bunny gif and I replied what’s up doc xD after they o was ghosted.... yeah I know, now I look like a weirdo in your eyes xD
Same!! I got out of a year and a half long relationship last June and that plus the quarantine has been beating my ass since. Kudos to you for being so strong despite the difficulties!
[deleted]
You aren't doing anything wrong, people are just awful.
🥰
Haha..may be.
Covid killed every possibilities, created some also.
But a little.
Yeah, we hope.
Thus we're alive😊
Better you watch the movie to understand better.😊
[deleted]
Holding out for a hero xD but yeah you’re right just had bad luck so far xD x
Aww thanks yeah haha I’m starting to think I should put a spikey bubble around me xD
Yeah hah I live for that quote “night is darkest before the dawn” I think like most people I heard it from Batman first! But it keeps me motivated into thinking better things will come x
I have several times. Depends on which quote or side one considers as correct. The nihilistic pointlessness of hope or that hope is necessary for life. I've seen people believe both
Sure have you got snap? Mainly cause I’m glued on my snap atm haha xD haha truth is my eye sight is awful! One of the reasons why I thought I should eat some carrots xD
[deleted]
Or...

Have a trans bf/gf (whatever your preference is)
""Hope is a good thing. May be the best of them. And good thing never dies"" ❤️❤️ it's from the shawshank redemption.
It come out of my mind whenever i feel hopeless.
Yeah..there are people who believes both or one.
I believe in hope which makes me feel alive ; which prevents me doing suicide.😊
[deleted]
Hopefully it’s been two long years! And thank you so much btw x
Haha I like everything whether they’re cis/trans male or female. I’m bi might be the wrong word for it but that’s what I use xD
I love that film and quote ❤️
Sure I’ll message you on here just the inbox for me isn’t really lighting up much haha
[deleted]
I'm sure bi is fine. Some people really nitpick that stuff but the bi community has always been very trans friendly/enby friendly.

I'm technically bi because I *can* be attracted to men, but I'm mostly a lesbian lol.

Kind of like how I'm only mostly a girl... XD
I get the same on unmatching in tinder but even with relationships had bad luck first relationship 4.5 years got cheated on twice by her(1st time wasn’t sex) 2nd serious relationship ended like 6 years ago still friends though :) 3rd serious relationship she used to break up with me to f others so it didn’t count.. :P only had serious relationships in the past with women. Usually short relationships with men I’ve never been cheated on by guys but relationships with them have mutually ended or gone sour. Always told every relationship I wish I was female but “too scared to transitions” for the past 12 years but only started transitioning 5.5 months ago :P I feel like I have a bad cloud following me lol! But -hugs we’ll both  find someone soon hopefully x
Aww fair enough I just fall for personalities mainly when it comes to genders if that makes sense xD obviously were human so physical attraction matters Abit too but what I mean is I fall for people based on their personalities over their gender if that makes sense xD x
That makes perfect sense!

It's really a shame there are some people who can't see how beautiful you are, on the outside and I'm sure on the inside, too. You'll find people who can see it, though. 😊
Aww haha hopefully I’ll find someone!
You will!
Haha eventually I will xD"	ljtifw	trans	1536	1.0	2021-02-14 18:00:56

Sweetie, I don't know your age or anything, BUT, I was HATED by my parents.  My mother raged on me how I ruined her life by being born a boy, NOT the girl she wanted.  I would have been more than happy to have been her daughter.  Instead SHE HATED ME,TILL SHE DIED.

I'm so sorry this happened to you :(

Congrats on passing, tho!!
Big hugs and supporting energy.
I'm so sorry :( I don't understand why this happens. You gave your child your support, but then take it back later? For what purpose??
Your parents may come around eventually, but people are going to come and go from your life. Cherish the good memories, and use the lessons - both good and bad - to help shape yourself into who you want to be.

I know I'm a dumb stranger on the internet, but if you need to talk to vent, I'd be happy to lend a shoulder. ♡
You are loved.
It will be ok
Holy shit, that is awful! I really hope it gets better soon! We are here for you, for what it's worth.

That aside, fuck em, if they can't accept you they don't see you as a guy realized person capable of making your own decisions, you've done nothing wrong by living your best life. it sucks, bad, but you've got this, build your own family, I've that isn't constructed on a foundation as flimsy as blood. There are millions of people out there that will accept you completely with open arms as you are and will be
Family is what you make of it. You don't need blood to be family, and hate should not be apart of family. You will always have support. It may be hard, but just look to who your becoming and make them proud. Find your self love and best all the haters with it, you are beautiful and amazing. Rule this world with your love, and find your family.

I’m sorry honey. You’ll find the family that loves and accepts you for you. You are valid. Much love and hugs sweetheart. Do what you need to heal and find your strength again 🤗
Omg I’m so sorry for u I’m trans mtf as well with a religious mom I am closeted but I fell ur struggle
Maybe she'll come around in time, but whatever you do don't compromise your authentic self to appease her. We don't choose our parents but we can build our families with whomever we want. Once you find your people ignoring your parents is easier.
Sending love and good vibes 💜
I am so sorry to hear that. It'll be okay, I know it seems absurd now, but it'll all be okay. You'll be okay, you're amazing, you're valid, you're enough and you're beautiful.. We're all here for you
I had to cut my mother out of my life for my mental health. There are lots of mother figures who are willing to pick up the slack. May you find each other.
*hugs and head pats all the time* I’m with you through this, you got this. I’m here for you if you need to talk.
I'm really happy for you <33
*breaths deeply* your a goooooood girl!!!!!! Things will get better so long as you don't give up!!!!!! STAY DETERMINED!!!!!!!!!
i'm so sorry to hear that. that's awful, i hope things will get better for you!
I'm here if you wanna chat
If need be, my mum’ll step in. Real mums are supportive of their kick ass daughters like yourself. Keep being awesome, sis!

he sunflowers would mistake you for the sun, all turning to look at you.

You and the sun hold little to no difference, just like I cannot ignore the sun’s rays of light, I cannot ignore your radiant beauty.

If admiring your beauty was a sin, I would commit that sin every second of every day where no God or Devil would accept me at the end of my life time.

I don’t love you with my mind or my heart, I love you with my soul. In case my mind forgets and my heart stops.

stay safe qtpie
I'm so sorry for what happened to you, you deserve so much better and a supportive person. Stay strong, you're not alone and never will be
Been there, hug sent if wanted, still struggling
There will always be people that care about and support you even if you never meet them. For me, the best lesson I ever learned from my parents was who I didn’t want to be. Keep being you and stay strong ❤️
I'm sorry that you had to go through that, but at least you got the recognition that you wanted Sunday though. Here take this hug
This almost happened to me, mine sorta knows but doesn’t want to see/hear/think/ or be in any way reminded that im not cis. (I live with her and basically pre-everything, 22, and currently dependent)
Hey Miss. I’m really so terribly sorry to hear about your story. I’d like to say a few things and I hope they help.

1. You are not alone. Ever. I think feelings of isolation affect most trans people (myself included), however my DMs are always open should you feel alone and need to not be.

2. I want you to know that it will get better. And if it doesn’t, it will get easier. 

I’m kind of in the same boat, and processing this shit sucks. You are strong, you are brave, you are beautiful 🤍

-Miss Garnet
Some parts of our journey will be harder than others, but that’s why we’re all here for you in your time of need and I’m more than happy to make some time to dedicate to you if you require some comfort and reassurance. You are loved by many and are supported by everyone here. Not every challenge is the same and it’s ok that you are struggling right now. Remember to drink something, stay hydrated, eat some food and remember you’re not alone. 

Much love, Wren ❤️
i am so sorry. i cant even imagine that pain, thats just crushing in everyway possible. it may not seem like it but i promise it wont affect u as much. easier said then done ikkk😕😞i luv u 💟
You're valid, you matter, you're fricking worth it.❤️
I'm sorry you're having to go through this. I'm super happy for you passing though! She may come back around...all this can be pretty scary for parents and they can say some shitty things they don't really mean. You sound super strong and independent though and I know you can get through anything! We're here for ya. You aren't alone!
It's okay sister I'm a trans mlm my mom doesn't support me. you're not alone. 😗
We're all into this, we accept our selves and indirectly we refuse some privileges we've born with, but everything for our happiness
I will bring you into my family
I'm so sorry. Please remember there are lots of people out there that love you unconditionally. I am one of them. Please take care of yourself, you deserve happiness ❤️
That is so awful. I am so sorry to hear that.
Sending as much love to you as I can.
It’s apples and oranges, but my mother was like this when I came out as bi. As soon as I came out to my dad, everything changed. That is when I though I was cis. Our relationship has been strained. I fear it will only be worse when I come as non binary. 

My warmest thoughts are with you.
Hey. At least you didn't trip on a duck and fall into a mosh pit where you get bumped around until you fall out of it and into a swarm of wasps, right? (Trying to help through humor) but fr you'll make it through, I believe in you and I'm sending good vibes and love your way<3
I'm so sorry that your former mother isn't supportive. We all love you, and I hope you feel it.
I just wanted to say that this happened to me too. You are not alone. I’m so fucking sorry you went through this, I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. 

Wishing you all the best, and more. ❤️
I'm so so sorry that she's done that to you sis, you deserve so much better then that. Just remember you are valid and you are loved no matter what some people say. Feel free to message if you need to chat , happy to support.
It gets better, I promise. Find your chosen family.
I'm so sorry you are going through this when you just felt like you hit an important milestone.  Hugs sister!
Your lovely and amazing, even thoe we are strangers. I know that you will support me in my endeavors, Mayne not every endeavor. You know what I'm saying. You don't necessarily need your moms approval. All you need is your own.
I'm so sorry, sis.

Family is chosen. One day you will find your own family that will support you no matter what! ✨✨❤❤❤
You are an amazing person, and you will find people who actually love and respect you. Best for you. ( also, sorry for my last comment being so agressive, i hate parents who disown theirs kids. I ahte that kind if thing )
r/NestOfEggs
Sending love, just Remember your chosen family nanda far more than any blood connection. I'm sorry this happened to you :(
I know some people with families who don't support them. It gets better, I promise. I don't know how old you are, but you'll get to chose your own family at some point. One of my friends hat a gender reveal party. Just a room full of people who celebrated the fact he is trans. One day you'll be okay
It'll be okay, sis! We can talk about it if you feel like that'd make you feel better!
Everything is going to be fine, we got you. Sending love and hugs ❤️🩷♥️🩵💚❤️💚🧡💙🩷💚🩵💚💜🩷💜🩵
Jesus fuck your former mum is an absolutely awful person to betray and abandon her daughter

I’m a step-mum to two kids, and there’s no way that I could ever betray them like this - just can not happen. Parents who can have something seriously fucking wrong with them.

Family of choice is the strongest family there is, and you’ll find yours.
It's a devastating feeling, finally feeling like yourself but then having your true self rejected by a parent who is supposed to be the person who roots for you and lifts you up in life. I'm going through the same now, much love
I sadly never had a super good relationship with my mom. So when my egg cracked it just compounded the issues. It has been almost 30 days since I last spoke to her. I plan on waiting awhile before I contact her again. Time works in weird ways an can help people accept things they don't want. 
Also! Family can be outside of blood relatives. My current roommates an some co workers are like my new family. Enjoy the presence of those who love you for you ❤️
As the parent of a trans son, please know that we both support you and only wish the best. You are never alone!
Sorry for the bad. Happy for you on the good. Find your place in the sun and enjoy.
It's okay sis
Sending digital hugs and love❤
Oh no :(
Great job passing girl!
Hugs sis 🤗
So sorry about that. 

Also congrats on passing.
Congrats on passing. Hopefully you have people to lean on for support. The only person I have to lean on is my mother who says she'll only support me in being trans when I turn 25 but will be there as a shoulder to cry on if I need to.
Everything will work out, don't worry. And don't care about what others say, what matters is your own vision of yourself. You can overcome all hardships, sis!
It’s been a couple days. 

I hope you’re doing well ❤️
Yeah, my mom. My best friend, choose to be utterly in denial when I came out. The woman who begged me to get on HRT and therapy is pretending like she didn't spend years trying to get me out of the closet.

So sorry about your mom issues. It's so weird when someone who's been an ally for so long suddenly changes stances. ANYWAY

Congrats on passing, be sure to check in frequently and post your progress. It's inspiring! Thanks for being you 💕
I’ve been through this and it sucks.  One day your mom might come around I’m no longer disowned by mine and she even wants me to visit this summer.  

However that took almost 20 years.   In my years without a family I learned family are the ones we choose. Blood is not thicker than water so to speak.  We choose our family we are not born into a family.  It’s just most people in the cis world don’t have to learn that.  So many hugs to you.  Look to those who prove they care about you.  They are family.
""Family"" that disowns you when you're trans never was family to begin with. They were only family when IT was convenient for them. 
This kinda shit makes me so fucking angry. I am very sorry you have to go through this. Things will Turn for the better at some Point, youll See. 

And remember: you Always meet people twice in your Life. Your mum will See what she got from her selfish fucking behavior
Stay strong. You have a lot of people who love you out here.
I’m very sorry for that Sammantha… We love and support you ❤️
It's going to be okay.
I'm bad at advice but chances are you'll be happier in the long run. Take care of yourself

I soaport
thanks, i fucking need it
Thanks for the kind and brave words Michele, I'm 24 for the time being, mtf, hrt 3 months, currently I am openly trans, and when I leave the house I make a point to be with my skirts and blouses, but I still don't have a lot of casual fem clothes to just relax at home.

So I wouldn't say 24/7, but I am out to the world and anyone with at least one working eye knows it. 

Father always hated me, long long story, ma said she was supportive, but literal days after I decided to come fully out and trash the boy disguise I been using outside she now did this, so I honestly don't think she supports me at all.

Thanks, it was a real fucking milestone for me, seeing ""her"" for the first time in a mirror, it's hard to describe, as is dealing with what's going on at the moment, but I think I'll get over it all, eventually just kinda, learn to live without her, I know I'll miss having a mum tho
Thanks, I need those...
I think it's a form of control, my guess is that she didn't mind at first because like, offline only she knew, and I only dressed up in the safety of my room, but now that I began leaving the house as myself it's a whole another story, now people see the real me and I guess she doesn't like the idea of being mom to a ""bootleg woman"" in her words
Thanks, I'll probably take you up on that, people to talk to is always a good idea, now more than ever.

And btw, just one disowned me, I cut ties with my biological father due to abuse when I was like, 14.

But ye, thanks for the kind words
Thanks, I'm fucking lucky that I got a fiancee that can help me emotionally as well as financially, and a few good friends I can rely on as well, am on my way to finding a job now, and since there is nothing keeping me in the town I live in currently (fiancee is like, half a world of distance) I might just go to a better city if I manage to land a decent job there
Thanks, I sure hope so
It's worth a lot, the camaraderie, knowing I have people out there who not only understand, but some who been thru the same, it helps
Joined, will go there one of these days, while I'm not really an egg anymore that is where journey happened, so it holds a special place in my heart
Well I already have a sis, I did look for a new da recently but with no success
True that, few people know the full phrase is: ""the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb""

Which means literally the opposite as to the whole ""family is number one"" spiel a lot of people spout out
Thanks for the words of strength, and indeed, she was the last person in my blood family, now all of my family members are scattered across the globe and we only related like, a few hundred generations back I'd think
I think your comment got duplicated, but I still agree
Thankfully there's people willing to be my strength when my own falters, not all of them I can say are family, but I know they all care for me a bunch

Ye also happy cake day
Ye I can imagine it being even harder in your case, generally religion and transphobia go hand in hand, not always, but often enough for it to be an issue
Thankfully I already have a decently strong support network, so I know I'm not left to rot, and ye, I don't plan on backsliding now, took me 3 fucking years to finally be happy with who I am, I'm not going back to the misery I lived in for someone who just made it very fucking clear her ""love"" is conditional
Thanks, I need those
Thanks for the kindness, it really means a lot, specially in these shitty times
Fingers crossed, I currently have someone in mind, but I'll recover from what I'm going thru first, thanks for the kind words
Thanks, I'll actually take you up on that, sent you a chat invite

(Last time I replied to this comment I worded it poorly and got flagged by Reddit)
Thanks, I'll actually take you up on that, gonna shoot you a chat invite
Thanks, I'm also very happy I got to pass, was a real big moment for me, it's for all of us I think
What's this an Undertale reference?

Still tho thanks, for the encouragement and kind words
I think they will, I just wish she had been upfront from the start that she actually didn't accept me, would have been already living stable by now
Thanks, I'll probably take you up on that, I always like just talking it out with people, specially in situations like this
I'd like that, is there any sort of form I need to fill in to be adopted?
The United States are not the largest producers of sunflowers, and yet even here over 1.7 million acres were planted in 2014 and probably more each year since. Much of which can be found in North Dakota.
Awww so cute, thanks it makes me feel pretty
Thanks, I'll power thru and be strong, cause thankfully I have people to help me get up when life throws me down
Hug accepted, sent another one your way to help you as well, we know how much it hurts
It's kind of sad, my biological father had already taught me that lesson many years ago, and now the one who was my mother taught me again... Someone should tell them to coordinate better
Thanks, in all honesty it's not much about the recognition, tho I did share my happiness, but it was more the part of ""I am happy with how I look today... That's new""
Ye, my best tip is hold out for the time being, if you can start hrt in secret, might be a good idea to start, real big maybe there tho, but well, put your mental health before the rest, so if it comes to a point where not moving towards transitioning is too much to bear, start taking steps despite her, but be ready to leave if she does like mine and boots you
Thanks garnet, thankfully I'm surrounded by people who don't let me feel alone, I lost one support, but still have others holding me up
Thanks, learning that the hard way, but learning nonetheless
Thanks for the kindness, and ye it fucking sucks...
Thanks, don't think she'll ""come around"" tho, she's not the type to go back on her words, she'll suffer from the burns after saying fire isn't hot instead of admiting her mistakes and taking the balm
Ye, turns out that to win some happiness we gotta sacrifice some others it seems
Thanks, I'd like that, once I'm a bit better and more awake I'll take you up on that
Thanks, everyone here is so awesome giving me kind words to get me thru all this, it feels like a big friend group where everyone is helping me not break under the pressure
In all honesty, her timing was impeccable, she might have made me backslide if she did this before I saw how beautiful I could be, but finally seeing myself, well, it gave me strength, just enough to be strong thru what's happening
Yea, currently my found family is small, but with time I think some of my better friends might end up being part of it too
Think your other comment got flagged since I can't even see it on your profile, but well, I can see why you'd have strong feeling towards that
Here's to us getting thru this tough moment in our lives, fingers crossed the bad feelings last as little as possible
Ye, I do have a bit of a found family for now, and they managed to help me up more than once, this time included, I'll do all I can to be there for them as well if life does something to out them down as well
Glad to hear some families stick together despite it all, sad I lost this coin toss but happy not everyone needs to go thru what I'm going now, wish one of my blood relatives as like you, could have anchored me better thru some moments in life
Idk... Don't like being out in the sun, it hurts my skin...

Fr tho thanks for the words of kindness, all this affirmation and comfort is helping me a lot thru these days
Ah, the whole ""is just a phase"" discourse, wonder if that's why in my case she stopped being supportive after I came out to the world
Also, my feelings towards life are don't just sit back and live. Grab life by the throat and beat it up until you get what you want, never give up, keep going until you get what you want.
Thanks, it's still not good but, things are underway, I should be moving away officially as soon as one of the job recruitment places get back to me, and I'll be in a better space once that's done, I'm sad to have lost her but well, thankfully I have other people to be there for me
\*big-sis-hug\*
Homestuck refrenced 🙏
This is a little off topic, but I felt very similarly at first about not having femme clothes to chill out in at home, and it really helped me to start buying “girl tshirts”. I know it’s a little silly, but a v neck, and a floral pattern go a long way in making something more cozy. Also be sure to get something just a tad big for cozy purposes. Im plus size and Maurice’s helped a ton for just chill clothes.
It is so unfair that she would cut you out for something that gives you so much healing and joy.
Wish I could do more for all my siblings across the world.
If that's the way she describes you then if you had been born a cis woman and had some sort of disability that was visible to the outside she would disown you too? I think it's just transphobia and using such words as an insult (which says a lot how she views other people who don't look ""normal). 

Unfortunately this seems to be all about her, if you are seen as yourself she looks bad (in her head) but she is willing to ""indulge in your fantasies* if you stay hidden from sight. It's selfish and disgusting behavior. It just sucks so much that because all that she has to make you suffer unnecessarily. 

She may have disown you but she's the one who doesn't deserve you. It sucks and I won't pretend I know what it's like but lots of people pulled through and eventually you will too, and you will find a real family and friends who see you for who you are and genuinely care for you and you will feel much better than ever before.

I know much of what I say (and other comments too) may seem hollow right now, that nothing will make it better and it's hard to see the light, but if you can get through this you will eventually witness a beautiful sunrise.

I wish you all the luck and strength
""bootleg woman?"" wtf

Sounds like you ordered your mom off of Wish.
Do you have any supportive friends? If so ask if you can stay with them for a while
That's a good start ♡
Exactly, it actually is a fragile bond, a lot of parents see their children as property, even into adulthood
it did yes sorry lol
Thank you! It’s not my birthday so idk why that’s there but I like cake!
YOUR!!! Welcome 😁
Well, she’s asleep rn but I’ll ask her to send you something nice in the morning. She does send her love tho. :)
interesting
Fun sunflower facts with u/TheSunflowerSeeds 

Forreal tho is that your whole account?
Right, that's understandable.
That’s the plan!
Fuck yeah! I’m glad to hear it. That’s always my big worry when I hear stories like this because I remember how lost I.
I hear ya. Don’t sweat her then, if it happens it happens…you be you and put yourself first. You deserve to be happy!
Yep, but wath ever it thakes, don'?
come to aus i look after you
Yeah I get what you mean, it's comforting having people who will always support you.
I'm happy to see that you feel strong to face this. I spent my whole life running away from the idea of being trans. Last year at 46, I came out to my family, and my dad just flipped on me. It was literally my worst nightmare, but just like you, I felt strong to face the situation. I hope things improve for you soon.
I've got through it by surrounding myself with other trans (and autistic/ADHD for me) people who have been disowned too and made my own family. wouldn't have got through it without that support network I'd still be in the closet living at home
Sun can also be a term for peace, happiness and warmth of acceptance. More of my intent. I personally like the sun both ways, lol.

Your welcome.
It could be. For me even though I've gone out with a bra and boobs on and 15 to 25 percent, I pass as a female my mom still thinks it's a phase and I'm too young to decide. I turn 18 in 49 days.
Hey I’m proud of you for coming out and being true to yourself. 

I lost my mother tragically and unexpectedly before I could come out to her. I like to think she would have been supportive but she was of a different generation where being gay or trans was just taboo. 

I’m really incredibly sorry that you had to experience this as well as now having to move somewhere else. That is certainly not easy to do under normal circumstances.  So I can understand how things might be difficult now. 

I’m hoping your mother will grow a bit and realize the mistake she made and hopefully  the two of you can mend the relationship. 

Hang in there, we’re all here for you. and if you ever want to chat I’m up late and my DMs are open 💕
Say that a bit louder for those on the back...

Even she has been mentioning how after I started hrt I been more friendly, pleasant, and in general mellow (think my T was way beyond normal or SMT), and yet the moment I put on the dress it's like I bifle her
There is a way to help your siblings from across the world, you could adopt one, in some countries, a few dollars go a long fucking way, for reference where I live with 300 dollars a month I can live well enough on my own, rest, utilities, food, medicine, all that business, and here isn't even of of the more extreme examples, some places you can do even more with even less, so one way to help our siblings from across the world is to send them some coins, stuff like, 20 dollars is the difference between having your electricity cut or not, so yea, that's a good way if you live in a place where disposable income is abundant.

Disclaimer: I am not asking for money (I won't refuse money given, but I don't need it, am looking for a job but my fiancee can deal with my bills), if you think you'd be able to adopt someone like this, try to bond with someone and see if you'd be comfortable doing that
Thanks for that, and ye I know there's nothing I could do to make things go back to how they were, don't even think I would if I could, and ye she lost a daughter today, and I don't think there's anything that anyone can do to mend this wound

And about the whole things seeming hollow, I honestly was like that before, as in, a year or so ago, nowadays I can look past the hardships and know that much like walking on hot coals, it'll hurt for now, and sometime after I'm away from the coals, but eventually I'll be back as I am now, but further along in the road, with more ground covered behind me
Ye I'm going to crash on one of my friend's couch while I look for somewhere to rent, I won't be left to the dogs, I have people who care about me thankfully, and in that regard I recognize that I am indeed luckier than most
Ye, still my safety net is very strong, I'm glad to know they'll be there to catch me when I fall
Yea, that's a real sad reality, one that I hope one day the world will purge
Lol, it happens
From what I understand cake day is based off of when your Reddit account was made, so like, your Reddit birthday, aka cake day, is 22 march
Aight, I'll be waiting for it, hope I get to be a daughter she can be proud of
Well, there is one thing I wouldn't give up for my transition, just one thing, aside from that, ye whatever it takes
I'd like that, but in all honesty if leaving where I am was an option (financially speaking) I would have done so already, until I save up enough I'm stuck here
Fingers crossed and maximum effort, gonna work hard for my happiness
Well, TIL something new
See that's not even really an option for me since I'm living at a deficit right now, steadily going through my own savings.
Get your friend a gift after everything is going better
Ah ok cool! I learned something new today!
Ye I was like that for a part of my life too, it can be nerve wracking

I hate the hate for pronouns that aren't he/him, she/her, or they/them	"I told a friend my pronouns and he said:

""Look, I can respect he/him, she/her, and they/them, but this is where I draw the line. Why can't you just use he/him or they/them instead?""

""I prefer zhe/zhim, it's more comfortable.""

""It's too hard for me. Can I just call you he?""

""Please dont""

""Ehhh I'm calling you he. At least I don't use she lol""

I hate it. I hate how I have to use he/him instead because people say this kind of shit to me when I tell them my actual pronouns. I hate how if it isn't he/him, she/her, they/them, people, even queer people, will refuse to respect my pronouns.

I used to go by she/him, no one respected it. I asked them to use both but they only used she/her for me.

""yOu UsE sHe/HeR tOo WhY aRe YoU sO aNgRy??""

People told me to just use one. I couldn't decide between the 2 of them so I decided to just use it/its. My sister told me:

""Why?? Isn't it dehumanizing? Why can't you just use they/them?""

""I mean, yeah, it can be. Some people don't like it because it feels dehumanizing and it's not their pronouns. Don't use it/its for people who don't use those pronouns, but please use it for me! I like it, it's cool and I'm more comfortable with it/its than they/them.""

""I don't like using it for you. I feel like a bad person. I'll just use he/him.""

""Using it/its for me won't make you a bad person, you're just respecting my pronouns. Not using it/its is what will make you a bad person.""

""I still don't like it. I'm just going to use he/him for you.""

No one respected it. They told me it's weird and that they feel bad when using them. I was forced to use he/him instead.

I found out I was under the genderfluid umbrella and decided to change my pronouns depending on what gender I felt like. No one respected it and just used whatever pronouns they wanted to use for me.

""Wait, don't use he/him pronouns for me, I feel more she/they rn.""

""Ehh I feel like calling you he/him. Dw it's fine you also use he/him pronouns.""

No one respected my pronouns. I was too confusing. They told me to just stick with one pronoun instead. 

I decided to use zhe/zhim. People tell me it's too hard to use and that they don't know how to use it. I tell them how to use my pronouns but they still don't use them. They decided to just use he or she for me instead.

I hate how people tell me to just use they/them or he/him. I hate how people tell me neopronouns are weird. I hate seeing people (even queer people) debate about the validity of my pronouns. MY PRONOUNS ARE VALID PLEASE RESPECT THEM

I dont like using he/him because I'm under the genderfluid umbrella so sometimes I don't feel masculine. I don't like using she/her because I don't always feel feminine. I don't like using they/them because I just don't like with it. It doesn't feel like it's the right one for me.

Zhe/zhim is just so much better. It works when im fem, masc, and nonbinary. Unlike they/them, this one feels right to me. It's better than it/its because it has the letter z and z is my favourite letter. I wish people actually used it for me tho. They say it's ""too confusing"" and ""too hard to use."" Only one person uses it. Everyone else just uses she/her or he/him.

WHY CANT PEOPLE JUST RESPECT MY PRONOUNS ITS NOT LIKE IM USING SLURS FOR PRONOUNS WHY IS IT SO HARD?? STOP MISGENDERING ME STOP SAYING IM A MAN/WOMAN STOP MAKING ME BINARY. STOP SAYING IM A GIRL BECAUSE IM AFAB, STOP SAYING IM A BOY BECAUSE IM TRANS. STOP USING THEY/THEM FOR ME BECAUSE IM NONBINARY. JUST STOP,  PLEASE STOP.




Edit: Wow, thank you for all the neopronoun hate!! It is greatly appreciated, I'm so happy I got the hate I was complaining about! This is super awesome!! /s

I can't believe this is happening. We're all trans people but you're acting like how cis transphobes treat us. Just because you personally don't understand it doesn't mean it's not valid. Stop debating over whether I'm valid or not. I can't believe this is happening in a trans community, it makes me so sad.

Thanks to everyone who respects neopronouns tho!! It makes me really happy!! And thanks to everyone who doesn't understand but tries!! You're awesome! Here have a cookie 🍪"	"I don't get the hate around neopronouns/it/its pronouns either, like here's my approach to these things

Does XYZ affect other people?

If no respect XYZ

Like, it's not that hard
I find it difficult to handle neopronouns and to use them consistently. But i do really try. (Really helps if someone has a pronoun badge.)
I think a lot of people like the *idea* of being progressive but don’t think about the core ideas (e.g. empathy, universal tolerance, nonjudgemental curiosity, etc). Like, they’ll more-or-less follow the rules “don’t be racist, homophobic, sexist, transphobic, etc” but when something falls outside the rules they’ve learned, they stop practicing empathy and all that. They’ll make fun of people for being fat, or bald, or using neopronouns, having disabilities, etc as long as they still can claim they’re “following the rules” of progressivism

(Edit: I know baldness is a weird example, I don’t mean to equate it to the neopronoun thing at all. I included it because it’s a thing people think doesn’t matter, but as an older trans-femme it is extremely relevant to dysphoria. Hell, even cis people experience dysphoria from it. Again, not equating, just an example of a thing people are ok making fun of despite supposedly being progressive.)
I find the neopronouns a little strange but I would never do anything like that, if that’s what they want to be referred to as then that’s what I’ll do
Hey OP, what do you use as a possessive pronoun? 

(Or anyone else if zhe has answered this already & I just haven’t seen it!)
I can’t say I understand the appeal of neo pronouns myself, but if someone told me that they used neo pronouns I’d do my best to respect them, whatever those pronouns were. Just because I don’t understand it doesn’t mean it’s okay for me to ignore and erase their identity - that would make me no better than a transphobe.
Problem with neopronouns is you need to have a group prepped to use it, otherwise people default to he/she or they if they are totally confused.  It is considered offensive and considered calling them an object rather than a person, xer and such are considered off the beaten trail.  That all said, it should be possible to have your local friend group and work be able to gender you correctly.  If they can't they are shit friends and shit work, gendering someone correctly is the simplest thing you can do, we aren't asking for you to help move all the shit in our house or to help cut down a tree and move the debris, it fucking changing some words>.>

That said, misgendering might pop up from time to time as society is defaulted to he/she more or less.  We live in a very binary society and people default to it, even people you know as brain might take over and say 'oh yea looks like boy call them he'.  

Like I said, you need a better group of people but not sure what else to say.
My big issue with neopronouns is internal, I will beat myself up for forgetting them and that self anger (I’ve been told by a friend) can come across as resentment towards xem. We’re still friends and xe/xem/xyrs is becoming *less* of a mind fuck for me, but it’s like learning singular they, with even more of a curve. 

I’m sorry that people use the difficulty as an excuse not to use your pronouns thoughtfully, that’s really shitty.
Hey im sorry folks are disrespecting you like this. I think neopronouns are cool. It seems like one of those things that will become more normal with time. Like how they/them and being nonbinary was just ""too far"" not that long ago. A lot nore people are growing to accept nonbinary folk and hopefully soon theyll learn to accept people who use neopronouns.
Yikes, OP needs some serious support IRL. Zhe asked for so little but zhe got “ehhh I’ll just do this thing you hate” instead. Can’t people just listen to zhim? Not that hard.
It really urks me when people refuse to even try to get your pronouns right because its “too hard” like, yes using neopronouns in a sentence for the first time is hard, but just?? try?? 
im sorry people have been treating you this way, you rlly deserve better friends :(
Do I get neopronouns? It’s something I have a hard time getting sometimes admittedly. 


Do I respect them and the people that use them? Yes. English is a constantly evolving language and this is a part of that process.
In my language there's no ""they/them"". There's not even an ""it"", even objects have genders. It's absurd!! And, as someone who uses the pronoun that is considered as the translation of ""they/them""... I just want to say that i understand your pain. I'm sorry you have to go through this, but you're not alone in your fight. And I will respect your pronouns and anyone's too. It's a promise :)
“I don’t like neopronouns” “I find them strange” “I don’t understand…” 
You are legit in a trans forum. 
I PERSONALLY cannot understand why people who understand transitioning and the challenges that come with them would bash someone else for pronouns. Most of us struggle here and really love when people use the right pronouns so please respect OP.
I've never met anyone with neopronouns, but I would try my hardest. I don't use neopronouns, but sometimes I feel more neutral and flexible with them (as long as it's not she/her), so I wouldn't mind if someone used they/them or even neopronouns for me. 

It's kind of ironic that I see this post when I literally just got into an irl argument defending neopronouns. My friend, one of her friends I'd just met, and my sister starting talking about their LGBTIA identities when the girl I had just met suddenly exclaimed, ""Not to be rude, I support everyone, but if you use neopronouns don't fucking talk to me"".

The other girls including my sister agreed, going on about how _**they feel**_ like it's making a mockery of trans people who use she/her, he/him, or they/them pronouns. None of them asked for my opinion on it so I just watched them talk and didn't say a word because I suddenly felt like I was no longer in safe space.

This is such an issue with cis people and it's not funny at all. STOP TALKING OVER TRANS PEOPLE. If your cisgender ass and your cisgender friends are having a conversation about trans people and the ONLY trans person in the room is completely silent, THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.
I understand the neopronouns like ze, xe, ey, it (though using it I personally struggle cuz it feels like im dehumanizing people) and stuff like that but I cannot wrap my head around nounself ones, if someone could explain thatd be awesome
I feel like whatever makes people happy and comfortable go for it! It's no skin off your nose to call someone what they like to be called
Who gives a shit just use what someone wants to use. I think it's neat the kids are coming up with new pronouns
Trans is beautiful. We, each and every one of us recreate gender and our very selves in the image of our soul. People like OP take it a step further (a step ""queerer,"" if you will, not that queerness can be calculated). Zhey recreate in zheir own image not only zhemselves and the so-called fundamental aspect of humanity that is gender, but also language itself.

Neopronouns are beautifully queer
Is it ok for me to ask how these pronouns are pronounced? That would be the only problem I’d have with them, is if you texted them to me and I wouldn’t know how to pronounce them. But once you told me how they are pronounced, I would say those pronouns. Everyone deserves to use the pronouns that they’re most comfortable with. I’m a trans man, and I know what it’s like when people don’t call you the right thing. I’d never, in a billion years, tell you that you can’t use those words. It’s beyond comprehension, to me. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Hope you can surround yourself with people who will be respectful
I think non-traditional / neopronouns are neat.

I don't use them for myself, despite being genderqueer / genderfluid / confusing pile of gender whatever. I'm too old. Too old for the cool new pronouns. 

Besides, the people in my personal life won't even use they/them for me. So why bother trying to find something else I like better?

I don't see what the big deal is though. Adopting new pronouns isn't all that different from adopting a new nickname. And it makes the people who use them happy when you say them.
I fucking despise pronoun discourse like this because at the end of the day, the people in power who hate all trans people don't hate all trans people because some of us use neopronouns.

Throwing that cat/catself person under the boot won't save your face from being stomped on.
I hate the whole “oh neos are bad cause confusing/new/weird” rubbish. They are what the person chose to represent them, and anything else is just blatantly ignorant. Neos are real, they are used, and sure, you don’t have to exactly understand them, but that isn’t an excuse to ignore them and people who use them, because just like how only you get to define what your gender is, only you get to choose what your pronouns are, and being assholes to people who use Neos only hurts the community as a whole.
I use it/its and he/him, once I mentioned my friend how I really liked it/its pronouns in comparison to he/him and he was like ""Alright I'll use that one more then"" and I smiled so hard.

I mostly use he/him for other people's comfort but I also don't mind them, prefer it/it's tho they make me feel good about myself. 10/10 Would recommend using people's preferred pronouns you could be making their day.
Neopronouns can be hard to learn to use but I practice forming sentences that might get said a lot. It requires practice but so does learning how to pronounce someone's name sometimes. It's just basic respect to learn how to use someone's pronouns.

I use ze/zim! Also they/them but my friends know I also have neopronouns.

No one should misgender you just because they don't care enough to learn your pronouns. That's just transphobia. People use it/its all the time for babies and small children (""is it a boy or a girl?"") despite knowing children are human, so someone picking it/its pronouns should be fine.
I don’t understand why ppl can’t just respect pronouns. Like even if your uncomfortable with any sort of pronouns, YOU SHOULD STILL USE THEM. Like I’m uncomfortable with christians does that mean I’m gonna go around disrespecting them? NO. I still will respect, listen and validate them no matter my feelings. I am so sorry you had to go through all this crap. And to all the queer ppl also disrespecting zhim, you are literally treating ppl the way you hate to be treated.
i’m perfectly fine with neopronouns, my only thing is i don’t know how to pronounce some of them if i only read them and don’t hear them out loud. that’s just me being kinda stupid though. i feel bad about all the hate neopronouns get, it really isn’t deserved. like anything, it’s something people have to adjust and get used to, but people are never *going* to adjust if they just dismiss it immediately and don’t even try. at the end of the day, it’s none of your (the royal you) business why people identify the way they do and their relationship to gender, all you have to do is respect it. 

the amount of neopronoun hate in the lgbtq community, including on this post where OP is *literally complaining about neopronoun hate* is uncalled for, feeding into harmful stereotypes, and echoing cishet logic of “wElL tHaTs NoT rEaL, iM nOt GoNnA uSe ThOsE pRoNoUnS oR tHaT nAmE.” smh guys, you lot should know better.

Did zhe not say clears? Respect. Zhis. Pronouns. We know some of you don't like neopronouns, you keep saying that. Do it for zhim. Zhe has endured enough bullshit, it's time to give zhim some love.

Sorry to be so blunt, but this was needed.
Ugh I hate that shit so much. If I tell you my pronouns then those are my pronouns. If I say she/her don’t fuckin use they/them. That’s like me callin a very much cis guy by she/her. My “friend” Robbie is so bad about this. I literally don’t think he’s ever used my correct pronouns and always just days she/her and because he has a short fuse to say the least he gets pissed at me for correcting him. At this point if he doesn’t stop I’m gonna start callin him by she/her till he either gets the hint or one of us tells the other to piss off
I wish I could use my neopronouns more and hate the fact my native language doesn't have them :( I am sorry you get misgendered I know that feeling and I hate it too
Some neo pronouns are pretty common where i live, so i (try) to understand the struggle, im sorry you have to deal with bigotry like that
ITS YOUR IDENTITY, not there’s, not zhim’s, not xe’s, and definitely not fucking hers, it’s WHAT YOU decide for you, no one can take that away from you. I am in similar boat, my partner accosted me the last year just to try and get a “him” out of him… 
You Are Valid to me <3 
This community comes up with some weird fucking names to call themselves, youd think they’d be able to  handle something a little outside of the box 🫠 

I FEEL for this.  Message me anytime to rant about the so called queer community <3
I use she/her mainly but I have others I'm too scared to tell people about... so I understand
I don't understand the point of neopronouns at all
For me it’s twofold, often they involve syllables that to my knowledge don’t even exist in my language. I can’t easily pronounce them, at that point it’s easier for me to just avoid interacting with that person. if it’s online then it’s more that it’s using terms that people aren’t familiar with and it doesn’t come naturally without stopping and pausing. Not to start on ones involving regular nouns which I’ve met people that use and I just cannot work with, sentences break down before I can get them out of my mouth and are near impossible to read on screen/paper.
People get mad when you use they them as a pronoun and get mad when you don’t.
[removed]
Neo pronouns are hard for me, but I think that is only because I don’t know anyone who uses them. I view it the same way that I view any other preferred pronouns. I feel awful whenever I have to use he/him over she/her, and I assume the same is true for you. You found the words that make you feel the most valid and excepted, and anyone who doesn’t respect that is just being an ass.
I can understand ppl struggling to use them since it's newer and forgetting but if they don't even try they don't respect you.
[removed]
I’m so sorry people are being assholes in the comments, your pronouns are valid and you should get to decide how everyone addresses you, no one else. Using neopronouns like zhe/zhim is no different than using something like they/them they’re all just words and it’s frustrating to see people even in this community be assholes about it. All the best to you OP
i thought you were dissing on neos for a second and i got rlly scared lol, i hope u find some people that respect ur pronouns :((
Thank you for being vulnerable about this, I used to think neopronouns were silly but posts like this indicate they really matter to some folks

Also zhe/zhim is fun to say so people are missing out :)
Yeah they/them pronouns don’t fit me either. The thing is no one could argue my pronouns confuse them because my pronouns are literally he/him but my family use they/them or she/her pronouns anyway because I’m AFAB and they think I’m non-binary or just not valid even though I have specified many times that I’m a boy and they should just treat and refer to me like any other boy. I don’t know anyone with neopronouns and I don’t really know what they mean but I still think they should be validated and respected.
I’m sorry people in your life and people in these comments are mean to you. You deserve to be called whatever pronoun YOU feel comfortable with and you deserve people who make you feel included by using your correct pronouns.
Its really not that hard to just respect someone’s decision even if you don’t understand it. People do it all the time but when it comes to pronouns, all of a sudden it’s the hardest thing in the world. And the worst part is those in the queer or leftist communities who wont use neopronouns. Like how does that logic work
It's petty and bitchy, but just start referring to them by the wrong pronouns on purpose. Give them a taste of what it feels like
sorry for these comments :( i think ur pronouns r cool
I agree! I hate when people don’t respect neopronouns it doesn’t hurt you to use the pronouns but it does hurt the person your misgendering!
Out of curiosity, how would one pronounce those pronouns? Might steal em myself lol
All i ask is if you have Neopronouns, you please tell me how to use them grammatically.

For you, Zhe/Zhim would be easy, as it is literally just a Z in front of He/Him (Z in front of him, Replace S in she with Z? Idk doesn't matter)

Idk I'll always respect Neopronouns if you give me the means to be able to.
i hope you can find people irl who’ll respect you. pronoun choice is not for the comfort of others. misgendering like this is not okay.
Why can't we as a community realize that obviously the neo pronouns are not as comfortable for people to use. Yes it sucks! They/them has been around a lot longer and outlasted so many others because of it's ease to use in the English language. If you want to go by an odd pronoun you'll have to practice some mindfulness. It doesn't help to have expectations that people will find it easy to use. I will try my ass off to use the correct pronoun for people and it's frustrating to me when people dont even try, but you have to have some understanding around that as a human being. People aren't used to it. Find your inner peace. I know pronouns are a big deal, but they might not be as big as forming positive connections with our friends and bringing down the walls that separate us. I get your rant completely. I hope you find some peace.
TLDR: Be persistent and firm about your pronouns being used. They are YOURS.

You pick your pronouns that you feel the most comfortable with, honestly

Even if that means going back to something someone else said no to

If that one makes you feel the most at home in your skin, that is yours.

YOUR pronouns are not to be dictated by anyone else.

If they don't use the pronouns that YOU said to use to refer to YOU, then they shouldn't refer to you at all.

In fact, have the mindset that they have.

Your sister wouldn't think that someone means her if someone refers to her as a them or a he, bc she uses she/her/hers

If your pronouns are zhe/zhim/zheirs, then that is what you react to.

If someone refers to you without that, ask them who they mean. If they don't correct themselves, let them know ""that isn't how you refer to me."" and correct them. Tell them the proper way to refer to you.

If they continue not refering to you correctly, that's disrespectful. It's not hard. It doesn't hurt them whatsoever, they just do not *want* to.
dUDE? WHY ARE THEY?? TELLING YOU?? NOT TO WORRY?? THEYRE JUST MISGENDERING yOU??

like.

YO??

tf. 

i do have a question tho: is it pronounced “zay” or “zee” or “zeh”. i just wanna practice a lil.

edit: nvm, i read your reply to someone else :)
What’s the difference between they/them and zhe/zhim
I need an explanation of Neopronouns, I seriously need one before I accidentally upset people
I have a learning disability and ADHD, so if I can’t make connections that help me understand certain words, for example, it makes retaining and regurgitating information extremely difficult. I’ll always do my best to be respectful of all pronouns, but I have to ask people repeatedly to be patient with me because I’m genuinely struggling to keep track of how and when to use them with which people. I also have no idea how to pronounce them all and I’m in a constant state of panic that I’m going to offend someone.

A lot of us may seem ignorant or hateful, but we’re really doing our best trying to keep up and retain new information across a wide spectrum. We care, we just need some grace while we work on keeping up!
This is all reminding me of invader zim
Here, have a dose of euphoria. 

“Oh, Italic_Text is so nice. Zhey always help me!”
i'm so sorry, those people really suck. the casual misgendering here is on another level fr.

neopronouns can be pretty confusing, i gotta say - but i'm damn well gonna try my absolute bloody best to get them right.

zhe/zhim seems a fairly easy one to me, too - the pronunciation seems fairly straightforward.
yes! then you get to see how many binary trans people are transphobic and get pissed at you for using neopronouns because “neopronouns are dehumanizing”
I don't hate them but i don't understand them either. I feel like they/them fits very well for intersex, non-binary, 2-souls and pretty much everything that isn't he or she.
Jesus Christ. You know what I do in these situations? Call you by your name.

My two cents: I’ve never understood it, but I will still use it when referring to someone. Lack of understanding isn’t an excuse to be an asshole
Don't give them the space for disrespect. Hell, get passive aggressive and pick their pronouns for them too... If they get to disrespect your wishes that is an invitation to disrespect theirs. And if they get made point out how they are being hypocritical because, seriously, f- them. Not worth your time or effort, if they can't respect something as essential as your pronouns, they don't respect you.
The fact of the matter is we just don't have an agreed upon word for a lot of the spectrum, the problem isn't with how you identify it's that there's no agreed upon pronouns for certain places on the spectrum. It's not that it's invalid it's that we need words for it
This. I have two sets of neopronouns I prefer over anything else. I ended up settling for he/they because no one respected it anyway.
I hate when people do this, I use any pronouns I was telling this to a friend of mine and this is how it went.

Me: I use any pronouns .
Them:what about neopronouns?
Me:yeah those are fine too I really don't care.
Them:thats so weird why would you be okay with that? Just choose she/her, he/him or they/them.

I hate it, neopronouns are just as valid as any others. Although I do have one question how do you pronounce zhe/zhim? I've never heard those before.
Aaaa I'm sorry for alot of these comments OP. Your pronouns are yours alone to dictate and it seems you need more supportive people around you who at least try to understand. As someone who also uses neopronouns it's very upsetting to see other trans people use transphobic rhetoric against people who use neopronouns. 😓
I feel your pain. I know that while my online friends do respect my pronouns no matter what (since I’m not wasting my time and energy on interacting with people who don’t respect me online), most irl people will not. While I am comfortable with they/them in English (and also he/him but only if you don’t always call me that) - my favorite set of pronouns in English is thon/thons btw - there is no equivalent to they/them in German, the only options are just she, he, it, neopronouns and no pronouns in that language, and since people speak German where I live I’m kind of forced to speak it in my everyday life. Being called she gives me intense dysphoria, so that’s the one thing I want to avoid. I feel most comfortable using neopronouns (dey/deren) or no pronouns (just my name) in german, but since I know the vast majority of cis people will not respect those pronouns and just keep defaulting back to she/her (because I don’t pass as anything but female unfortunately) I felt forced to use he/him irl in the past. The thing is, while I kind of like small amounts of he/him in English I definitely don’t like being called he in German. It’s probably because the language is so agressively gendered, so the combination of all the masc nouns and adjectives and the pronouns is just too much (I do like the masc forms of most words tho). Also, cis people didn’t fucking respect the he/him pronouns either! At that point I just gave up and started telling people irl to use no pronouns for me, just to use my name.

I just hate that so many people, even other trans people, are such transphobic pieces of shit who will blatantly misgender people who use more unusual pronouns. Those who give you shit for it on this subreddit should be ashamed of themselves, we trans people, no matter what our genders and pronouns are, need to support each other, because if one kind of trans person gets pushed under the bus the rest of us will soon go down as well. We’re in this together. If we of all people don’t respect each other’s pronouns, who will?
I didn't understand them until my egg cracked. Being called ""she"" makes me comfortable and happy, so it makes sense that the word would be different for others. I don't know how to justify it to people who haven't experienced euphoria or dysphoria, but I don't think it needs to be justified. It makes people happier and doesn't harm anyone, it must be good.
I completely agree. If someone tells you their pronouns, do your best to respect it. It might take time, but apologize when you say the wrong thing. It’s all about practice.
That fucking sucks! I'm so sorry you had to experience such discrimination and dismissiveness of your identity and feelings. 

You are valid and fuck anyone that tries to gate-keep our community. The majority of us support you but we fail to speak up because we assume everyone is cool with neopronouns.
Some people believe the pronoun you use should reflect something substantial about yourself, but most people don't really know the objective implications of zhe/zhim particularly.
I'm rlly sorry you have some awful ppl in your life! also! ignore the assholes saying neopronouns are too difficult or are bad for the community. they're wrong. it's like trying to take the 't' out of lgbt, or trying to say aro/ace ppl don't belong in our community. it's exclusionism to try to appeal to shitass cis ppl and it doesn't work, it just hurts ppl.

anyways! ik I seem like the stereotypical trans guy or trans masc to a lot of people in my life, but honestly my preferred pronouns are he/xe. I usually say they're he/they, or he/xe/they. I understand the struggle with ppl not respecting neopronouns. I rlly wish they would. I not all that comfy with they/them bc it's been used to hurt me in a lot of ways. but I'm not just he/him. I wish I could say he/xe and have people accept it, without having to add the they bc ik ppl won't use xe. and it feels important to me to be able to convey that my gender is more then binary male without having to go into the specifics.

Ive been much more visible and pushy abt my neopronouns as of late, bc ik I have trans siblings like you out there. I'm often the ""token good trans"" so I'm trying to use that power for good. 

I hope you find more people who care abt you enough to actually respect your pronouns. you'll find your community eventually<3
I completely respect neopronouns! Those people who don't respect your identity aren't worth your time. I hope you can find people who respect who you are as a person!
To be honest I don't have any friends who use Neo pronouns anymore but when I did I made an effort to learn how to use them- even if I didn't understand them too much. If it makes the person happy then isn't that what matters? 
I hope OP can find better friends, zhe deserve it.
I don't think the neopronouns are OP's problem, honestly. Sure, zhir friends are being shitty about them, but from the abundant examples zhe gave it sounds like they're pretty shitty about anything that's not using whatever pronoun they feel like at the time. Sounds like zhe might need new friends.
Zhe/Zhim is soooooo freaking cool! How is it pronounces??
OP, if you see this, my condolences on the shitty behavior from your friends and loved ones. Your personal pronouns are just that: personal. Thanks for the brave post and for putting words to things I’ve felt and experienced for the 10+ years I’ve been out and in the trans community. 💖💖💖 
Sincerely, an it/its user who just lurks in this sub because of people like the ones you describe
[deleted]

Looks like I missed the shitstorm.
I use neopronouns, but I don't tell people about them because of this. I already get enough shit for being a they/he, afab, feminine looking transmasc who wants neutral language except when it comes to compliments. My binary trans ex made fun of me for neopronouns and xenogenders as well as the specific way I'm trans because it doesn't fall into there idea of nonbinary. I just want to scream that they cant be trans supportive if they make fun of the specific way I'm trans.
I feel like this is why people wanna kill us… just sayin
Personally I use they/them by default because it absolutely conforms to classical English rules for any person it could possibly reference, but if someone told me they wanted me to use different pronouns for them you bet your sweet azz I would try my best! If people aren't going to support you or at the very least lightly respect you, then it's on them, not you. I'm sorry cis people can't respect you, my fellow alien!

(If alien is offensive, I don't know, I just like the concept of being an alien; space is neat)
OP, I’m sorry you’re feeling so disrespected in your daily life. You deserve better. 

Anybody else saying they don’t understand, check out https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/ and do your own research because it’s not on OP to explain zhimself to us
Here's the thing, most people aren't educated on what neo pronouns really are. Neo pronouns are attached to some really homophobic memes, they were sort of the thing that made a lot of Transphobic people point at us and go ""this person is making up new genders look at how stupid this is!"" Etc.


A lot of people in our own community don't even know what they really are.

We aren't yet to the point where neo pronouns are known of other than them being ""made up genders"" (which is such an un educated assumption it's so dumb) and the stigma behind them will continue to make it harder for people who use them.

We're not yet there, it sucks that the people around you won't even put in the effort.

You don't have to understand to at least respect someone's pronouns. Your personal opinions shouldn't get in the way of someone doing what makes them comfortable.
I accept that everyone is allowed the pronouns they identify with but I find it hard when it’s new language. I know a lot of older people who are from a different generation have issues with this. Wouldn’t it just be better to use the persons name and not use pronouns at all. I mean why would this cause an issue with the gender fluid person?
Lol I like how everyone in this sub is giving their (not requested) opinion about whether or not they “understand” neopronouns. This is a venting post, not an advice post. I’m sure most of us can relate to being misgendered and forced into boxes. There’s no need to add your two cents about the understandability of OP’s pronouns.
“It’s too hard” isn’t an excuse when they’re learning and using new words and terms every week. Like you learned an entire language, maybe two, learning a new pronoun isn’t hard, it’s just practice
Bruh I swear why can’t people just not be transphobic? Like i feel like the only way I might use em wrong is by either me mispronouncing them or not know how to use them but you said that you explained to them how to use your pronouns and probably also pronounced them to. For fucks sake I’m cis and even i know how to use your pronouns it’s not hard to say zhe/zhim instead of literally anything they want to use
As a fellow neos users, I feel you OP. You deserve respect.
Some people are incredibly lazy. Lazy enough to squeeze someone inside their limited vocabulary and understanding. I get so angry when people have to go through stuff like this. Same for the OP here. Zhe definitely deserves better people around zhim. :(
I have exactly one person who uses ze/zir pronouns for me (I am comfortable with both ze/zir and she/her, but ze/zir has a bit more of a connected feeling to me).

I really wish more people would try. It shows respect and compassion towards me. I also find it unacceptable for people to not use neo pronouns when that is the only pronoun that feels correct to a person. I'm sorry you are dealing with this.

(if I may) _\*hugs\*_

Those people are stupid, your pronouns are zhe/zhim so people should refer to you by zhe/zhim, they shouldn't decide what your pronouns are, it's your pronouns. not theirs.
[removed]
i fully respect zhe/zhim, but my brain is ruined and to me it reads like an old German man complaining about someone...

that being said, OP is reasonably angry, zhe deserve to have their pronouns respected

to be honest i don’t understand neopronouns as much. not in a disrespectful way, just that i can’t keep track and sometimes it’s hard for me to remember. But i will always respect it and use them for people if they want me to. My friend and I just had a conversation about it. I’m trans and people weren’t calling me the correct pronouns. And how people need to understand how to respect people. You don’t need to understand something to respect it. I don’t understand sometimes, but I respect still.
Using different pronouns really isn’t difficult, they’re just making excuses not to try. Idk if it’s just me being very accustomed to different pronouns but it really is not hard at all. I’m sorry you had to experience that, it’s so frustrating 😞💕
The amount of people literally spreading neopronoun hate on a post about neopronoun hate, and the amount of upvotes they have, is very upsetting.
NEOPRONOUNS ARE VALID

I don't use neopronouns but I respect those who do. Kudos to you for breaking lingual gender constructs. I hope you get to make friends who respect your pronouns.
First of all: that sucks :( booooo 
2nd, how do you use those in a sentence? I don't know many people who use neos an most of them are *noun*/*noun*self, so it's not too different from regular he or she or they. Im not too used to xe or zhe or e or stuff like that
3rd: I totally understand not feeling comfortable with normal pronouns. While I use he/him most of the time, i also occasionally use bee/bees/beeself, but usually I don't tell people about those so they don't get used :/
As someone who uses it/it's neos, I understand. Of course, I can't understand 100% bc I use he/him too. I am so sorry that you have to deal with that, I really hope it gets better soon
As a xe/xir I absolutely feel you, when people ask I just say they/he because they NEVER remember.
i relate hard, as someone using neopronouns myself. lots of trans people, LET ALONE cis people don't get it.

Lemme just say it for the people in the back:

> Neopronouns are a category of new (neo) pronouns that are increasingly used in place of “she,” “he,” or “they” when referring to a person. 
>  
> Some people prefer using neopronouns as an alternative gender neutral pronoun set. This could be because they want to avoid singular ""they"" being confused with plural ""they"" because neopronouns express something about them or their gender (like xenogenders), or because they feel more comfortable using neopronouns over any of the standard pronoun options.

Oh and have a [link](https://neopronoun.carrd.co/) about neopronouns.

People are so annoying, my god! I don’t understand neopronouns or why anyone would use them, but if people feel comfortable being called something other than she/her they/them or he/him I will try as hard as I can to use their pronouns correctly! Sorry you’ve had such shitty experiences. I hope you find some friends who can respect your pronouns. Zhe/zhim is 100% valid <3
Maybe it would help this person if you explained to them what zhe/zhim means and why it makes you feel more comfortable

The beet we can do is explain, it’s the only way to combat other people’s ignorance. And when that fails walk away; they’re rarely worth it
People who dont experience it dont understand often and its sad. I wish you the best, and hope you can find someone who will resepct your pronouns and who you are
Gender is a social construct and thus pronouns are an extension of that. Society and the language we use are familiar with the pronouns he/him, she/her, they/them, but neopronouns aren’t used enough commonly to really weigh as much as the others as far as I can tell. While the honest thing to do would be to respect someone’s pronouns regardless of what they are, it is also understandable that people may not find it entirely applicable. This of course is my thoughts on the matter.
hot take: ive never understood why people say “gender is a construct!” then completely 180 when it comes to xenos and neopronouns.
I use she/him and there’s exactly one person in my life who actually uses my pronouns ;-;
Zhe/zhim
As a cis person, I get not understanding, but I don't get not respecting OP as a person. Everyone, including zhim, deserves to have their pronouns respected. It's not that hard when you get over yourself and give your best effort. People understand that you won't be perfect about it at first.

My biggest issue is that I can barely remember faces and names, best I can do is they them if I don't talk to you on a regular basis because otherwise I would have to guess
I’m sorry🥹🥲
I don't understand the use of it/its, I feel like it is dehumanizing, and I don't understand what the other pronouns represent... I use She/Her... but that's for me.

Even if I don't understand neopronouns, I believe because I am a binary transgirl, it doesn't mean I can avoid using others' pronouns. If you feel like using a certain pronoun, my opinion doesn't matter, I must and will use your prefered pronouns. You want to use it? I will use it for you because it makes YOU feel ok with yourself.

It's not something hard to do to respect one's pronouns. Who wants to be called it I will call it, who uses she I will call she, who uses ze i will use ze. People must be respected, so those who don't respect the pronouns you want to be called as, they are all just assholes.
So. I have no problem with them. But every time I hear Zhim... I swear I just think of Invader Zim. And it's not that I think it's funny.. it was just my favorite show as a kid lol.
So, I have issues with the neopronouns because nobody I know uses them. Also, I am autistic with ADHD and my brain is complicated enough right now trying to understand some of the new information about how it works. My child is non-binary and prefers they/them. OK cool! I am a transman, so I respect their wishes. However, there are some days where they come out and go ""hey! I feel more feminine today! Use she/her!"" That alone throws my brain for loopsies. Then, when I finally get brain to comprehend, I go ""OK!"" Then...next day were back to they/them. 

So, from a NT pov, they have no reason to really fight these neopronouns once they are used to it and reminded to use them and if they fight back, go no contact for a bit. From a ND pov...it is a very grey area bc there is a lot more going on up there than what we show. I honestly do try to learn all of the stuff that pops up in our community, is just...takes a bit for brain to truly comprehend what is being said. Is very tiring. But in all honesty, I really hope the people in your life get MUCH better at accepting your pronouns and using them correctly.
I’ve never understood the hate for those types of neopronouns either. Like the ones that are like nouns, I get being confused by them and a lot of people just say ‘I’m not gonna do that’ because it’s weird, but the ones that are remaking he/him, she/her and they/them are all fine because you can just try to compare it to the main three in your head
I'm on team ""call me whatever"". I absolutely respect pronouns, but I do find it exhausting. If it means a lot to someone, I don't see it as a huge inconvenience. It does make people hard to interact with though. If you get fired up every time someone accidentally genders you, that will make sure you have few friends.
The only pronoun I use to address someone is you. Just use their name, problem solved.
I can understand neopronouns but habits are hard to break. We’ve been conditioned to expect a certain set of pronouns so when new ones are added, it’s a bit difficult to adjust. I do my best, but I usually use they if I’m not sure. 

Being 100% honest, I’m just thankful when folks use the right pronouns for me, and I use they/them. Do I feel like a they? No, but it’s better than being binaried. Unfortunately, not everyone is going to get it, but those that do should be cherished and loved.
I feel like the queer community is veering off onto a path that doesn’t resonate with me anymore. I support you doing whatever you want but all these kids using gender identities that were created yesterday is a little exhausting to me. But I don’t wanna be that bisexual hypocrite that views this as a stepping stone to your true identity when I’ve been told that about my sexuality.

I just feel bad for the binary trans people that have to share a label with a million other identities that aren’t even technically trans by definition. It’s not lost on me that in the 2000s, edgy emo was the trend, in the 2010s, indie hipster was the trend, and now, gender non conforming is the trend.

I just hope it’s a legit thing people are going through and not a way to enter the community without actually being queer.
i’m going to go through these comments and downvote all neopronoun hate. neopronouns are valid asf.
only pronouns i refuse to use is it/its, because trauma.

i grew up gnc with an ftm parent and a homophobic father. my parent and i were called an “it” on many occasions in a degrading manner, so anytime i see someone exclusively use that as a pronoun i avoid them because i can’t come to terms with that right now.

i won’t ever call someone out on this or give them shit if that person’s friends refer to them that way, but i just can’t. call me transphobic, i wont put my comfort behind someone else’s
I have to talk to way too many people every day just to remember a special set of pronouns just for you, I’m sorry.

""Hate"" is a strong word.

I completely respect it, but how do i use this in a different language so im properly identifying you? That’s the only major issue I have with neopronouns. I also speak Spanish so I want to be sure when i’m speaking i dont use él or ella but ig in this instance you wouldn’t prefer usted, which is as neutral as it gets. but then there’s many grammatical things that i have trouble with.
I don't really ""get"" neopronouns. I'd even go so far as to say they sometimes seem kind of silly to me.

The key word there being *me*.

I've got enough empathy to recognise that they don't seem that way to the people who use them. 

And it's a trivially small effort on my part to try to remember and use whatever pronouns someone asks for.

So yeah. I don't get it, but there's a lot of things I don't get but still support, and this is one of them.
I agree with many parts of this post, but I kinda get irked by complaining about people only using on group of pronouns, if you provided multiple and people find it ""easier"" it is justifiable that they use one of them. I of course have friends that use pronouns like she/them and he/them, but I tend to use she or he more often, and me using they/them for a binary person who doesn't use exclusively those pronouns is me speaking a lot, in which case my brain defaults to gender neutral pronouns. Although keep in mind, I do agree with you, I always make the case that neoprounouns are valid as long as they're pronouns.
Ok so first I feel bad for you and the hate you got personally I don't understand using pronouns outside of he/him she/her and they/them because of my understanding but you made some points that did help pronouns are based upon on how you feel and I didn't think about that specific detail emotions are complicated so of course pronouns can be too. I usually try my best to respect people's pronouns because I'm trans mtf and I want mine to be respected I used to feel weird about they/them only because of the English language they/them is plural but as a pronoun it's singular but now I'm used to using they/them as a pronoun so it doesn't feel weird anymore I've even used it in reference to a friend I didn't want to reveal had told me they might also be trans but didn't want to refer to as he/him since that's what most people would think they are because I thought it was non-binary until you said you didn't like they/them because you're non-binary I don't understand it/it's tho could you explain that one please I'm following the same logic as your sister calling you an it/it's sounds kinda disrespectful but based on the post I don't think you see it/it's as referring to something that's anything less than being a human being so can you explain to me why you see they/them as non-binary but not it/it's. I'm still new to neopronouns as well I understand there's a bunch but I don't understand what they all mean or represent, is there anything you could tell me about those as well? Also sorry if any of these comes off as offensive it's not supposed to.

Edit:After reading the comments I think I understand the reasoning behind other pronoun usage, so my question is what do you feel like the differences in it/it's and they/them is as well as the issue of they/them isn't non-binary like I thought and more information on neopronouns.
If you think he/she/they are the only pronouns people can go by I automatically hate you, and I almost can't hate people.
Pronouns probably should be treated as an attribute similar to one’s name; at first you can struggle to remember them but eventually they should stick. We (we are plural, so our pronouns tend to be dependent on whether you are referencing the group or a member) feel like this mindset is necessary to negate the argument of having “too many pronouns”.

I'm terrified to meet someone who uses neopronounes, because I WILL mess up and someone is going to get accidentally hurt
How does one pronounce ""zhe/zhim""?
Neopronouns aren’t for me, but I would still show the same respect for someone who uses neopronouns. It’s really not that hard to understand
How do you pronounce your pronouns? I’ve never met someone who uses zhe/zhim and I’ve never heard them used and I’m curious. Is the h silent or is it like a sh sound with a zzz added? I feel very dumb for asking this and I swear it comes from a place of the deepest and purest love💛🤍💜🖤 I’ve thought about using neopronouns because people would lose the “but they/them is confusing because I’m used to it being pluralllll” excuse and they could either use the neopronoun or admit their transphobia, but I have a feeling I’d be disappointed in the amount of people who would just drop the caring-but-incompetent act and admit their transphobia.

(Edit: spelling mistake fixed: if to I’d)
One thing I’ve learned is that people don’t usually bother to mix up the pronouns they use for you if you use more then one I use She/He/They and well some people will just pick one and stick with it cause our brains are looking for the quickest route possible memory wise it doesn’t want to think too hard. Some of my friends will mix it up from time to time but people in general are just lazy really and that took me awhile to realize
I don’t personally use neopronouns, but I also fall under the gender-fluid umbrella. I personally like they and it because both can be used for anyone, and they cover the fact that no matter what my gender is, I am me. A person. So I understand why people like neopronouns or feel better using them because sometimes there isn’t one that feels like it’s truly you.

I’m sorry you have to deal with this, and while I know that I personally don’t have to deal with it to the level you do, I understand. You are valid and you are perfect as who you are, and nobody can take that away from you.

And to the people in the comments being assholes,consider how zhe feels. Imagine what it feels like to be misgendered and remember that even if you don’t understand, it costs nothing to be a good person to zhim or anyone else.
I used to think neopronouns were confusing and to be entirely honest, I wasn't sure whether it was real (hypocritical, coming from me- a trans man, I know)

Since then, I've met two other people who go by neopronouns and I actually feel more disgusted by the hate than I could ever feel at the people that use them. I'm greatly disappointed in myself, and I hope the people who have been saying these things to you will end up feeling guilty for causing you harm and come to an understanding of who you actually are.

You're a wonderful person, and just because your pronouns are different doesn't mean you deserve all those comments and backlash. I'm sorry this community isn't as accepting as it should be.

Honestly, I don't really understand a lot of neopronouns (specifically noun-self ones) but I'm still going to use them for people if they want me to. I don't have to understand to be respectful (but I am still trying to learn, I want to understand). Also, it really does suck when you have multiple pronouns and only get called one. Mine are he/it, but I only get called he/him because that's the ""normal"" one. People have multiple pronouns for a reason!
I’m sorry people are so shitty. I don’t understand why people make such a big deal out of it. It’s fine if you don’t understand, you don’t need to understand you just need to be respectful. If you want a friend who will actually respect your pronouns no matter what they are feel free to message me
So I have no problem with neopronouns and definitely try to use them the couple of instances it’s come up but it is tricky. 

I get why he/him and she/her doesn’t work for you but I am curious at why they/them doesn’t? Like you didn’t really explain it (not that you have to) but also why would your “friend” default to he/him, when an acceptable (in their mind) analog would be they/them and it seems like it might offend you less?

I’m sorry you got such shit treatment by a friend, seems like you made a reasonable request from someone that seems like they’d be supportive.
I’m sorry that you have to deal with those kind of people because you don’t use “traditional” pronouns. Your pronouns are valid and people should use them- since that’s what makes you comfortable. Pronouns aren’t supposed to make others comfortable, it’s meant to make the user of those pronouns comfortable. I hope you find a group of people who will respect your pronouns.
Genderfluid AFAB here. Some days, I feel differnt by the hour. Like OP, sometimes I wonder what pronouns actually fit me. I'm still figuring myself out, still trying to learn about the LGBTQ+ community.

I'm also an identical twin. (Twinsie is cis.)

On the one hand, I 100% get the outrage over being misidentified. It's infuriating. People would/do get our *proper nouns* wrong, yes, even on purpose. They know us literally our whole lives and still misidentify us: how??? On the other hand, pronouns have never been personalized in the English language. You need to recognize that you're challenging the function and definition of pronouns, if for nothing else than to manage your own expectations. It's more than just your identifiers, even if that's all it is to you.

Languages change and evolve, and yes, every word is made up, but if we all created our own words and syntactic rules, communication would be impossible. Acceptance of neopronouns will require time, effort, and patience before society feels comfortable with the shift. I'm glad you vented here, but it's gonna be a long road. That's just the reality. As both a twin and genderfluid person, I hope you can find a way to deal with these frustrations in a more positive manner for your own mental well-being. Being misidentified sucks, especially when it's done intentionally. But don't let that anger eat at you. Find creative ways to reinforce your chosen pronouns, be patient and gracious, and consider establishing boundaries about it. At a certain line, Twinsie and refuse to acknowledge the wrong names; it forces the issue when we do that.
Zhe/zhim is the first neo pronoun I ever heard of, before even the idea of using they/them, the main character in my story I was planning (never actually wrote it) immediately became zhe/zhim. Only realised zhe was a self insert years later, a I want to be self insert, the me currently self insert of a young girl who was just a bystander in most of her life was more obvious.
Neopronouns are weird to me and I don’t like using them but if all I have to do to make someone feel comfortable is change what word I say to identify them with then I would absolutely try my best to do that
sorry that people are being shitty in the comments, op. you're right.
I'm terribly sorry this has happened to you. Personally I don't understand neopronouns that well but I will try my best to respect them. I just have a lot of other queer friends so sometimes pronouns are hard for me to remember since I can accidentally get them mixed up. That and I'm worried about pronunciation. So I'm sorry if I get anything wrong, it's just hard to remember sometimes since I'm under lots of stress. I really do hope people respect your preferred pronouns though! No one deserves to be misgendered!
I need to clarify before this that I’m not trans, so I have no right to actually argue about this and if I’m wrong or insulting about anything then I’m happy to learn, but I also personally don’t see why it’s such a big deal? I don’t know anyone in real life who uses neopronouns, but as long as you explain how to use them then it really isn’t that difficult????

The way I see it is that our language is fucking thousands of years old, and the majority of it has changed or become outdated in even just the last few years. People like to stick with he/him she/her they/them, but to others those are outdated as well. I mean we’ve realised gender is so fluid, is it really that hard to understand that the pronouns we created so long ago don’t fit everyone anymore???? Gender isn’t binary, so why would or should our pronouns stop evolving to account for all the different people who are just now able to live as they truly are???? It’s just wild to me why people care sm about a goddamn pronoun I stg

If it’s okay with you, can I ask how to use your pronouns? I’d love to learn :))
Yes, I use she/they (in english, in portuguese I use ela/dela), I respect others people pronouns as I get respected by mine, neo pronouns are ok if it's not in a serious case or matter. It/its is tolerable for me tho. He/him/his, she/her/hers and singular they/them/theirs is way more aceptable... sorry but I'm a bit conservative about it
i totally get you.. i thought i was a trans man but thinking about it, i understand what you mean. i want to use neopronouns that have no pre-existing gender (male, female, nonbinary) attached to them because i want to identify as all… wow.. i deadass just came out to myself in a reddit comment. shits wild lmao
I am so lost
:0 I love your pronouns ive never seen those ones before and i mean i mightve but i dont remember it therefore it didnt happen and this is the first time im seeing them and they are cool 👌
Ppl wanna be victims so bad 😂
Because what the fuck is Zhe , what even does that mean , you just put z infront of the word they saying and expect it to change ,
Frankly no hate towards you or your pronouns but in general i hate how pronouns are such a big thing like Oh no i call a “they” a she. Boom. Chaos. Like wtf i think theres just more relevant and important things in the world to care about but you re mad because i cant remember that you’re a xie.
I have a brain that cant retain information from conversations so i dont care much about what people tell me. 
But its that they make such a big deal of it. 
The universe is huge everyone is a speak, a dot in existence i just have no care for pronouns. 
Ill just address you by your name with respect ofc
[removed]
I mean, I *kinda* understand it/its. I feel uncomfortable when using it for people because I feel like I’m kinda dehumanizing them. But that’s a ME problem
This. I don't really know anyone that uses them personally but I know there are a lot of neopronouns out there that exist. I'm afraid I'll mess them up. It also shames me to admit that I occasionally mess up they/them with my SO too (albeit very very rarely). It makes me feel super crappy everytime it happens.
As long as you genuinenly try and don't make it about your or make condescending comments, you're fine.

Why wouldn't being bald matter almost everyone experiences it and nearly everyone feels bad or ashamed because of it. Shouldn't that make it matter? (Sorry if I made this confusing I can be more specific if needed)
Same, I don’t understand them but I also don’t understand marine biology, doesn’t mean I don’t respect marine biologists
right thats where i am
Exactly, i dont see how people don’t see the obvious hypocrisy of hateing neopronouns while being trans themselves.
Like i stg 
“I can’t respect someone because I don’t personally understand their identity. “
Is the only reason transphobes exist anywhere at all. Gaaah/vent
Hell misgendering pops up regardless of pronouns unless you are 100% cis passing. Even then, cis folks get misgendered too on occasion. Intent matters just as much as the words said. If someone is attempting to be respectful I'm not going to hold them to the fire for occasional mistakes.
I think it's ok for them to say it's difficult or express it's weird but only expressing that is ok I don't think it's ok to use it as an excuse sort of like how you'd say something was heavy after putting carrying it it's ok for you to say it's heavy but you shouldn't leave it outside because it's heavy if that makes sense
AAAAA OMG TYSM FOR USING ZHE/ZHIM FOR ME THIS MEANS SO MUCH :'DDDDD
for real, zhey got the response that zhey were venting about. i love this sub but sometimes it sucks. neopronouns arent hard to understand at all. im sorry OP about the comments :/
ikr? even in some of these comments people were being dicks to zhim and invalidating zhim like what’s the need
[deleted]
WTaF??  Cisgender here. I would equate the talk of those other cis ppl to be similar to being called the wrong name because “you didn’t like how weird it sounded”.  Then proceeded to say you’d never talk to to anyone with that name because…[reason] *right to their face.*   Okay, so it’s not a pronoun you’re used to hearing or saying, I get that, but the aversion to using neopronouns is taught or learned.  Either family, social media, news, religion, friends, somewhere that is learned or an aversion to what isn’t readily understood.  Also, many people don’t understand how to use them, what they are, or what they mean. If someone asked me to refer to them in a certain way, use a unique name, using particular pronouns, is married to the Berlin Wall (objectum sexual), or whatever—if I cared about them as a human being, I will do what makes them feel comfortable (within the limits of the law.)
A lot of people use nounbased pronouns somewhat metaphorically. 

I read an article a while back that I’m trying to find again which was written by someone neurodivergent that felt no connection to the binary, neurotypical understanding of gender, and understood nounbased pronouns as a way of expressing their relationship with gender to others. 

Kudos btw for trying to understand. As a disclaimer I’m a binary transman who only uses he/him, and I’m still learning, too. But I know what it’s like when people say, “I respect everyone, but I draw the line at _____.” I know for a fact I am on the other side of that line for so many people and so are a lot of us and I just can’t fathom the lack of empathy it takes to draw the line again for someone else!!

Edit: ofc I don’t know everything about nounbased pronouns so this is only one reason for using them and i am open to anyone else’s experiences or ideas (especially since I’m a binary person)
Ikr, I'll never understand why it's sooo hard for poor mushy brained people who uphold toxic standards as a hobby.
I’ve noticed a lot of people automatically converting Op’s pronouns to (z)they/them
It seems like an accident but op uses zhe/zhim
I just thought I’d point it out because im pretty sure people don’t notice they did that./gen/nm
Imagine he/him but with a ""z"" in front.
People complain about new pronouns, however in the 1800s and before then, we had whole rounds of inventing and trying new pronouns that never stuck around. People just want an easy out I guess, no care for feelings or meanings.
Yeah, it’s really disappointing to see so many people in this thread throwing others under the bus. On a trans subreddit nonetheless.
My main problem with neopronouns is probably that the way i was introduced to it was with that whole dreamsexual/dreamgender stuff where they said their pronouns were ""dream/dreamself"" and I've not been able to take them seriously because of it (although i tried for a friend who used xe/xem to at least not gender them)
[deleted]
It's not really all that different than names. And they/them will almost certainly remain as default 'I don't know their gender/pronouns' and then when you do, you use their pronouns just like you use their name. 

Another thing to keep in mind about who knows to use your pronouns is that for non-passing trans people (or lots of enby people, etc.) people *won't* know what pronoun to use. If you're still masc looking but prefer she or femme looking and prefer he, those aren't what they will say naturally. 

This is what got me to get completely over my own issues about neo-pronouns: ""I took my phone and opened tinder and started swiping; got a few matches and texted one and then snapped a few times."" 20-30 years ago this sentence would make *no* sense to almost anyone. Yet you know exactly what I mean (even if it is a little bit of a hackneyed sentence). Language advances, especially when we're willing to use it.
They’re just words, they’re all made up and none of them are things we say “naturally”, they’re literally all learned, they all have limited contexts and none of them are truly universal. If some people feel its worth it to distinguish themselves with uncommon pronouns who are we to say that’s wrong? Like, you’re right to identify that it will be a challenge for these people to establish their pronouns in the common imagination, but struggle is a part of life and what can we say if someone has decided that it’s a worthwhile struggle for them? 

If we happen to have an emotional reaction to some pronouns, it seems like it’s on us to unpack that and have a confrontation with whatever it is making us uncomfortable rather than digging in our heels and centering our comfort over the desires of those people.*

*I am and will continue to be quite bad at using neopronouns for some time. They have little weight or currency in my frame of reference but I’m willing to work on it and I don’t think they should be delegitimized or invalidated.
The amount of explanation necessary is literally just ""I use Zhe/Zhim"" Those are just words used to refer to someone, there's nothing deep about it. anyone can use he/him, she/her, they/them, or anything regardless of their gender because pronouns are uncorrelated with gender. There certainly are some cultural associations between some pronouns and some genders but not everyone fit within traditional stereotypes/norms and while it cost nothing to respect someone's pronouns, the benefice is immense for the recipient.  
It must feel awful for op to be constantly misgendered like that, and we can \*feel\* through zhims replies how happy zhe is when people use zhims pronouns correctly.

It's not hard to use neo-pronouns, and requires very little explanation. It's like learning someone's name or nickname. If you knew 2 people named William and they both went by Will, would you tell the first Bill you meet it's too hard and you'd rather call them Will? English has been struggling to find a gender neutral pronoun for over a hundred years and I think we're still trying to find one that sticks. So in the meantime people are gonna come up with new ones and try them out. I think they/them has the most history and likely to be the go to, but language is weird and there's no such thing as ""real words"". Zhe/zhim isn't confusing, and it takes a second to catch on when some one is using it.
I'm not sure if it's worth it, and yeah it definitely is hassle to be like this. No other pronoun fits me better than zhe/zhim tho, and I think it's easier for my friends than me constantly changing pronouns everyday.

And yeah, people outside of my social circle won't know my pronouns, but isn't that normal? Most people don't know a person's pronouns until they become friends or check their bio.

And we're not all going to use neopronouns lol. Saying ""if we all used neopronouns how will we know what to call each other?"" is the same as ""if we're all gay how will we reproduce?"" It's never going to happen, and if it will I think we'd know how to address each other. It'd be like names.
If it wasnt worth the hassle nobody would use them. Also all pronouns are made up so it really doesnt matter much if it's what people want.
You say we can change language, which requires people to use this new way of communicating over time, then you say we shouldn't be asking for people to use our neo pronouns because not enough people use them.

Changes in how we use language starts somewhere and is never widely used or accepted at first. If we just stop using words just because they are new (or that they are hard to relate to your own experiences), language would stop evolving.

It all starts somewhere and takes a lot of time, but telling people to stop asking people to respect their identity and pronouns is anti-progress.
New gender neutral pronouns have been invented throughout history in the English language. If the person you’re speaking to understands how important it is to respect your identity, they’ll figure out how to use your correct pronouns. Zhe is literally out here talking about how many people are saying this stuff to zhim every day so I don’t think you needed to say it. Zhe knows communication is a two way street and zhe has tried a LOT to be conducive to the people around zhim but they refuse to respect any pronouns zhe has tried to bring up
Yes!! I really don't understand the hate for neopronouns like it's not doing you any harm?? Just respect it?? As long as their pronouns aren't offensive like using slurs for pronouns then why not respect it? The hate for neopronouns makes no sense
Oh it's he/him but you replace the h with z. The h is there for aesthetic purposes lol
Oh I asked but I might've missed someone else's, where?
They/Them and Zhe/Zhim are different sets of pronouns, that's pretty much it really.
That’s like asking the difference of she/her and he/him lol what
https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/

I saw this helpful link above.
You don't sound like you're refusing to use zhim's pronouns though, which is kinda the issue the other people were doing. making mistakes and trying your best to be respectful is what's important.

I don't use neo-pronouns, but my twin brother sometimes has issues using she/her and I understand why, as he's not perfect and is used to me being a ""guy,"" so it takes some learning. Especially so since we live so far apart now.
It’s not binary trans people that are the problem, it’s truscum. I’ve seen non binary people get riled up at different pronouns, it’s horrible.
Sorry you have to deal with that shit. You are who you are and it’s completely valid to express that with your correct pronouns. As someone else said, people use “it” to refer to kids all the time, for example when they say “is it a boy or girl?”

And even if nobody had ever heard the word “it” in their life, you deserve respect, period.
https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/

Some people don’t feel like they/them fits. It may be because those folks don’t identify as specifically non-binary and wish for pronouns that are closer to one side or the other or are not associated with the societal expectations for non-binary people the way they/them is now, or for a million other reasons, or for no reason. It may just not feel right. 

Gender neutral pronouns have been around, with new ones being invented, throughout all of recorded history.  

As a trans man, if someone refused to call me “he” and would only use “they” I would be very upset by that. It doesn’t matter to me that “they” is neutral; it doesn’t work for me. If I have told someone to call me “he” and they keep saying “they” then they’re misgendering me. 

Sidenote, many intersex people have binary genders; being intersex has nothing to do with gender. It just means you were born with more ambiguous sex characteristics. Many intersex people may never even know they’re intersex.
Well for you it fits. But for some of those people it doesn’t. That’s really all there is to it, neos make people more comfortable.
Is this in ref to op? I cant tell 😓
Sorry you had to do that. It really sucks that people aren’t willing to try. You deserve respect.
I agree. It sounds like zhe has had so many conversations and tried so hard to be conducive to their feelings and explained zhimself like 400 times so at this point it’s on them to figure it out. OP deserves better.
It's pronounced zee/zim!
Shitstorm is kind of an understatement tbh. I can’t believe I saw this type of bs on a trans subreddit of all places. Like got damn
A gender fluid person doesn’t necessarily feel like all genders all the time. He, she, or they might apply to them some of the time, but always calling them one of them could cause dysphoria. Here’s an idea! Try your best! Just like with learning someone’s new traditional pronouns it’s a learning curve! Its not going to be an instant or easy change but just saying “I find it hard so I’m not gonna try” just isn’t ok.
Yeah lots of very uncalled-for statements and ""opinions"" here. Pretty disgusting for a trans sub, people here should be better.
Exactly! Holy shit some of these people are dumb
[removed]
I think you misunderstand nounself pronouns. They’re not saying they feel like that thing, it’s just that those pronouns they have a connection to. 

Also the excuse of “thats why we aren’t taken seriously” is literally a bigoted argument that started with truscum to invalidate non-op trans people, that was later used to invalidate non-binary people, and is now being used to invalidate a subsection of non-binary people.
[removed]
Do you use that argument when someone changes their name to one you haven't hear before? ""Oh, sorry, it's not in my vocab and sets me on edge so I'm just going to pick a common name for you that is somewhat inline with your gender.""
hey; i think you misunderstand what xenogenders are. no one (at least i hope) is saying their gender is a cat/fairy/cloud. they’re just trying to describe how they experience the abstract concept of gender.
idk why ur bringing up xenogenders when they arent mentioned in the post ??
So OP expresses discomfort for a friend refusing to use the correct pronouns, and you come in trying to DISPROVE the poor fucker's identity?

Get out of here with that performative support bullshit. You can't claim to support somebody the sentence after saying you think it's bullshit.
I'm sorry, I've been (and am on) vacation, and the team in general has been a bit busy lately. We've been trying our best to keep up, but we just saw this post, and I'm cleaning it up as best as possible.
It's creating a different pronoun so ots something more comfortable than he/him for zhim  they don't emotionally like the usual male pronouns and want something that doesn't upset them. I may not totally understand neo pronouns but I can understand that some things upset different people. If I hear someone call me ma'am it makes me upset because I'm not a woman do I feel uncomfortable. They feel this same discomfort for those pronouns and found something that doesn't cause that feeling.
Zhe wants you to use them to refer to zhim like this.
You could have just said the last part my dude - the fact that you went out of your way to post that first half contradicts itself
""I'm not gonna be disrespectful""

""I think it's silly""

Pick one, dick.
yo am I getting downvoted for my pronouns? In r/trans ? Sad
I'm curious, how is it that only one person uses your pronouns when you list she/him? Are you asking for literally she/him/his (i.e. She loves his own homemade bread?) Or is it a typo? (btw, I don't think this is invalid, just hard [and some of the most worthwhile things in life are hard])

(I also literally only have one person who uses ze/zir pronouns for me instead of she/her, probably because I use either ze/zir or she/her and people just tend to stick to ""muscle memory"" when it comes to my pronouns?)
You make a great point, but this post is not really a discussion post about it/its pronouns.
[removed]
the basic thing for the first is that pronouns are a form of gender expression, but that doesn't mean that a given pronoun corresponds to a gender identity (example: I'm agender, but I feel most comfortable with fae/faer or it/its; sometimes she/her but it depends on who you are I suppose :p)

it/its for trans people in particular is from a sourced from reclamation of tactics of dehumanization (often associated with the voidpunk subculture, at least in my brain), but reasons of use could vary a lot (as with other pronouns)
[deleted]
I'm not going to ban but asking to use pronouns other than he/she/they isn't extreme. Refusing to use other's pronouns is pretty extreme.
Yeah, no wonder zhe used it in the message.

He/him but with a ""z"" in front.
I assume it's he/him but with a ""z"" in front.
Bro that just means you dont support neos
How would you feel if someone just couldn’t tolerate using your pronouns of the day?
Fuck that shit. Why is it intolerable? Why do you get to decide what other peoples geneder is, what makes them comfortable. What based on how they look? We exist as a group because others decided we were intolerable, don’t do the same for eachother as well. That just makes you just as bad as them.
Don't feel bad. I will catch myself using he him pronouns for me. I'm solidly they/she non binary, but it's hard to unpack years or even decades of habit
Whether they “help the progression of the community” doesn’t matter. Trans people don’t help the progression of the gay community, we also encourage regression for people who already don’t respect gay people. That doesn’t mean people should stop being themselves.

In summary, [this image](https://i.redd.it/as3hte9s0xg91.jpg)
Well, I agree it is important, I was just worried people would disagree and say it’s not as big as identity? idk. Though tbh yeah any dysphoria-inducing trait intersects with identity

(to be clear for me it’s a huge fear, I know it will be ok if it happens but it’s just a fear)
I've heard there are many benefits
Respect is the key word. I feel the same on this. I don’t need to understand it to respect it.
Could you explain deeper what you mean by not understanding? It is that you don’t know how they function in a sentence or some other type of lack of understanding?
Check out r/TransTryouts for more gender affirmation!
Question op, how would one pronounce this irl? Is it just  how you would say ze? Or does it have a verbal h? Or  something else?
They said they were non-binary and trans, or under the umbrella, and many people under those umbrellas use neo-pronouns.
not it doesn't have to. I have a friend who uses both she/her and he/him. Isn't a guy, isn't a woman. But absolutely hates being called nonbinary. He's just himself and is simply trans.    
Or literally how OP is talking how zhe is genderfluid and wants a pronoun that fits with all three answers. And especially with how at this point they/them is established as the non-binary pronoun, I get it might feel really off on a day zhe doesn't feel like that.
[removed]
Oh ok! I thought it might have a “sh” sound and that’s what confused me, tysm!
I just woke up and am trying my best to clean it up, sorry about being so late, I'm on vacation in another country. >.<
Dreamsexual (as in about the Minecraft youtuber) was a 4chan psyop, unsurprisingly. 

Dream/dreamself neopronouns (as in linking your experience of gender to the experience of dreaming) was a thing before the Minecraft youtuber.

Again, I recognise that it's a far out concept if you aren't introduced to it lightly, but radical acceptance is a cornerstone of the movement.
>And they/them will almost certainly remain as default 'I don't know their gender/pronouns' 

I didn't think about that. It's true though.

>Another thing to keep in mind about who knows to use your pronouns is that for non-passing trans people (or lots of enby people, etc.) people won't know what pronoun to use.

You're right. Since pronouns are based on gender, it's ""easy"" to misgender someone, or to not know what to use.

>Language advances, especially when we're willing to use it.

My primary language is french and our ""they"" is a new pronoun created for the purpose of having a mixed pronoun (or gender neutral?) which is ""iel"" (mix between ""il"" (he) and ""elle"" (she)). It's now in the dictionary. They should do the same in other languages I think.
[removed]
Thanks for your explanation. I don't say that's wrong, not at all. I was just genuinely trying to understand because reading op's post, it felt like a lot of work. 

Anyway, if someone would ask me to refer to them with neopronouns, I would do it. I would never refuse  because I want to respect them.
I understand that op feels awful for being misgendered. I don't say that neopronouns shouldn't exist. I just genuinely want to understand, and was wondering if it was worth the efforts op has to put in explaining that. But I better understand that yes, it's worth it.

Also my primary language is french, and we have a mixed pronoun now (or gender neutral?), which is ""iel"" that's a mix between ""il"" (he) and ""elle"" (she). It's a new pronoun, unlike ""they"" in english, that is already used for plural.
>English has been struggling to find a gender neutral pronoun for over a hundred years and I think we're still trying to find one that sticks.

Yeah my primary language is french and a gender neutral pronoun was created and is now in the dictionary: iel (mix between il(he) and Elle(she)).

I struggled with the pros and cons of neopronouns when I came out.  Sure, it isn’t easy for a lot of people (often including the people who use them!), but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it.  If it is right for you, it is automatically worth it.

It is so upsetting to me to see other trans people using the same rhetoric that is used by cis people to validate transphobia and misgendering and apply it to people with neopronouns.  “I just think we should follow the rules of science/language”  “It’s just a word, why do you let it define you?”  “That’s too hard for me to remember.”  “I wouldn’t have known unless you told me, so it isn’t fair.”  All of those arguments are fundamentally ridiculous, and they have all also been used for gender non-conforming cis people, binary trans people, non-binary trans people who use they/them.  It’s just queer-/transphobia with the goal of making you feel guilty and responsible for how hard their phobia is for them 😢🙄😬.

I’m sorry this happens to you.  But you are totally valid and worth using the pronouns you want.  Btw if you choose to wear a pronoun pin, people will still ignore it, but they can’t say your pronouns aren’t universally accessible 🙂.

Take care, friend!  💜
Just commenting to say I agree with you and I don’t know why on trans Reddit anybody would be saying it’s unreasonable to be upset at being misgendered. 

Gender neutral pronouns have been around as long as English has and people are constantly inventing more. This is NOT new. 

That argument sounds like the people who call us transtrenders when in reality trans people have been around as long as gender identity has.
[removed]
Yeah! It’s just a word it’s not like it’s a slur it’s just a word!
Huh, I always pronounced them like the 's' in measure, but only in my head. The more you know
Wait then you would pronounce them like he/him?
Sorry I don't speak English natively so I don't understand how would the pronunciation be
Nice
idk, but zhe said it was pronounced like he/him but with a z instead of h
How do you feel comfortable with zhe and not they
Agreed

Omg! That's so cool!
As a mod, I agree. Been doing my best to clean up after seeing it first thing in the morning. Was not expecting to be raised by truscum while on vacation.

Some people do actually identify with those pronouns because they identify as those things. I have a lovely friend who uses xe/xem and voi/void and though I don’t understand what it means to identify as a celestial/void being I do know that xe is wonderful and deserving of the respect of using whichever label voi prefers at the time.

I just a meant it was seemed a little strange sorry to offend you
Sorry that’s happening. Your pronouns are valid and you’re valid
Yes it’s literally she/him the full set is she/him/his/herself
[removed]
Thanks for explaining me. I don't believe I still totally get it... but anyway just like before I am no one to decide what pronouns must be or not be used. I want to be refered to as she, if someone wants to be called ""it"" I will use ""it"", for ""they"" people I use ""they"" and so on. It would be very transphobic to do otherwise.
Girl I’m 24. But I am old enough to know that this was not the reality of the queer community at large even 10 years ago. At this point, being able to choose to be queer is annoying and rubs people with no choice but to be queer the wrong way.

Also if you’re so progressive, you wouldn’t shame someone for their age.

Makes sense
Obligatory Context:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/pgq1tn/there_are_many_benefits_to_being_a_marine/
probably means they can’t relate to wanting to use them?
For me it is like this

I can understand wanting to be more masculine and wanting to go by masculine pronouns, like he/him.

I can understand wanting to be more feminine and wanting to go by feminine pronouns, like she/her.

And i can understand finding yourself outside the gender binary of masc/fem and therefore wanting to go by neutral pronouns like they/them. 

But what i don’t understand is what makes someone want to specifically use pronouns like zhe/zhim? It obviously is supposed to be something outside the binary, but at that point, why not just use they/them? What is it about neopronouns that are more desireable than using the already established gender neutral pronouns? I get that they are more comfortable, but i don’t understand why. Like for me as a trans-femme, i like using she/her because it appeals to my feminine identity and my desire to be a woman, but i don’t understand what is it that drives NBs who use neopros to use them rather than they/them. Like if you wanted to be outside the binary, surely you would just use the nonbinary pronouns that already exist. 

I would also like to add, i’m not trying to sound like i’m wanting to not use neopronouns, if that’s what you want to go by, that is what i will try to use. I’m just trying to gain an understanding on why you want to use those specifically, and voicing my lack of understanding so i can hopefully be enlightened.
I assume like the french j, or the s in vision :)

The line thing? Super fair. 

I’ve only lived in the US so I can’t compare with anywhere else, but “All people deserve respect (as long as they’re exactly like me and I understand them)” is pretty much the foundation of this country lmao
Honestly no need to apologize. It’s not you’re fault that people are… the way they are.
[removed]
That’s all that a neopronoun is…a gender neutral pronoun that has recently been added to the language.  I’m glad that “iel” is being used!  When I learned French years ago, it didn’t exist, so that’s great 😄
One of the advantages French and Swedish have in this regard is that those languages are dictated by a group. English doesn't have anything group that updates the language so it all has to be done organically over time. On one hand I think it's really cool that we have this explosion of interesting pronouns, and have for a long time, but it's harder for these things to hit the mainstream. I use they/them and even that has caused some discussion, and those have been around since old English!
Yeah. This thread is garbage, I'm cleaning it up.
What WILL be enough then? Zhe/zhim and other neopronouns are already being used by many people, meaning they do have value to multiple people. According to your criteria, they're worthy of being added to the language.

And why, in a trans sub, would anyone be calling not wanting to be misgendered ""demanding compliance""? It's a simple pronoun, not a dictator's new laws being enacted
Words help frame our perceptions and understandings of the world. People often react poorly to feeling like those frameworks are being challenged or that their understanding is imperfect. It’s not good but it is and I think people would do well to reflect on what exactly they’re protecting: Their actual safety or just a feeling of safety.
Pronounced ""zee"" ""zim""
No you replace the h sound with z
Oh that makes so much more sense!
Personally? I don't use Zhe, but to me it'd be because they/them either:

1. Doesn't describe my experience as a trans person.

2. Gets confused for plurality.

3. Isn't something that makes me comfortable.
Okay yeah based
[removed]
Xenogenders don’t mean they identify as that thing though. Xenogenders are literally just metaphors. Nounself neopronouns aren’t always connected to xenogenders either. 

Xenogenders and neopronouns are valid but it’s incorrect to say things like “someone who is catgender identifies as a cat” because that incorrectly represents xenogenders. Otherkin would be identifying as said thing, like identifying as a cat. They could also use nounself neos if they wanted.
Ok then, be bigoted if you want. Throwing your own community under the bus does nothing but make you a bigger target faster.
I know people who use multiple names. Every heard of nicknames? It's not hard.

Also, using that name as your choice is pretty mocking. So I don't think you get my point.
[removed]
[removed]
“I think it’s kinda silly” why the fuck was it necessary to say that?? That is actively disrespectful to anyone who uses neopronouns. It would’ve been SO easy not to say that
Ie we should not ever say he for you, only she, but also never her, just him?
You absolutely don't need to apologize, however a vent post really isn't the place to discuss the validity of using the ""it"" pronoun. You're absolutely entitled to never use that pronoun for people if it's this painful <3
Person. Calm down, you’re the one who said “they/them/theirs is easy considering we already use them but ze/zhim/…zeirs??”. Replace the “they/them/theirs” with “she/her/hers” or “he/him/his” and “ze/zhim/zeirs” with “they/them/theirs”. It’s the same argument people were making a few years ago against non-binary people. And idk how the heck being a white queer person matters in this case, as a trans POC, I don’t see it mattering at all. And calling the person transphobic was uncalled for… especially when they’re defending OP and other neo users, and are trans themself. Take a breath and consider things again.
Wow that is a lot of assumptions. I don’t show up to marches cause my parents would quite literally kill me if they found out. And also, how in the fuck did you misunderstand my comment that badly?

There are so many LGB people who say they deserve rights, but trans people don’t. There are so many binary trans people who say they deserve rights, but non binary people don’t. There are so many non binary people who say they deserve rights, but neopronoun users don’t. My point is that all of these are equally stupid - people will make fun of the LGBT community no matter what, infighting and saying that *some* LGBT people are invalid will never be helpful.
I’m sorry you’ve had shitty experiences with white people, but you shouldn’t generalise because that’s the exact same thing transphobes are doing. If it helps I’m white and go to marches, I stick up for everyone who’s oppressed, of course that doesn’t fix anything but you really shouldn’t generalise, and you’re also being racist which isn’t helping anything
Did I pick the one profession with a massive tumblr thread by accident?
Tbh, that's my assumption. 

I get they/them.  I even quite like she/they.

I have no idea why anyone would want to be called zie/zem or whatever else exists.  
I have no idea why some people who use she/they need to get both of em.  
I don't need to.

It's yet another opportunity to practice 'respect without understanding'.
Not sure what the downvote is for when I’m asking a clarifying question to better understand the speaker to be able to better engage with the speaker. 

If we could understand the lack of understanding, we could address it. Alas, relating and understanding are two different things.
it's for the exact same reason that you use she/her. that's literally the exact reason. because it's what feels correct and affirming and Good. 

there are also binary trans people and cis people who use neopronouns. it's not just nonbinary people, just like there are cis men who use she/her and cis women who use he/him. 

but no, it's literally the same reason why anyone uses any pronoun that they use. because it feels right and comfortable. sometimes that means inventing something new. i had to do that for my gender identity, some people have to use that for pronouns.
This is like my viewpoint exactly
Identity shouldn’t have to be about progression. I’m not trans to be some kind of force for progress, just because it’s what feels right for me and it’s wrong to place that burden on other trans people too.
Yeah, but sucks that there was so much garbage here that I only just saw. Trying to keep a safe space isn't easy, but, y'know, it's important to me that I try.

I think it was added last year in the dictionary.
Oh okay, i was more confused about the z sound than the ""ee"", but apparently there's only one z sound in English, like in zoo.
Somehow i though there was other variant but messed up with Spanish z which is pronunced like th im think.
So yeah I was confused of it should be pronunced like zee or like ""thee"" my bad.
Btw as a Spanish speaker, its so hard for us to pronunce differently ""she"" and ""ze"". We only have one sound for that so :(
[removed]
I don’t know why you are explaining xenogenders to me. I was talking about a specific being that uses voi/void as a set of pronouns which voi include with other neopronouns when self labelling. Voi is plural and does not identify as human and collectively choose to identify as a celestial body/void being. Edit to apologize if this seems combative, I appreciate the clarification you are making and I am sure in most instances nounself pronouns are not about being the thing but about associating with aspects of it, however in the specific case I was talking about the being explicitly identifies as being a void being.

hi!!! you just replied to a post where OP is using zhis pronouns in real life! so it would be wrong to categorize zhim as “terminally online” ! 

spreading neopronoun hate on a post venting about neopronoun hate is wild
Please don't invite raids from them by linking their sub here <3
Correct
I talked with a friend about it and they said the same thing. 

I still feel horrible for not being able to, like I'm invalidating anyone who feels most comfortable with those neopronouns.
[removed]
Nah, you probably chose it for the benefits
Definitely respect regardless of understanding but it’s also worth attempting to understand. As a binary trans man, I would prefer that people at least try to understand who I am and genuinely see me as a man instead of only changing the words they use. Here’s an article about neopronouns which may help https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/
That's a good way to view it personally I like to try and understand why also makes it easier to respect but I don't need to understand or be able to relate to respect it
I think the downvote is because the asking if it’s struggling to understand how they work in a sentence comes across as condescending because it’s pretty obvious that they work exactly like any other pronoun. It didn’t seem genuine; it seemed like a jibe.
I haven’t downvoted you, that’d be other people
Yeah, but i don’t understand why they make you feel affirming and good. For me what is affirming and good about feminine pronouns are that they make me feel like a woman. That is the understanding i’m after, why they make you feel good.
Mind if I ask what you invented? I'm curious
[removed]
Oui, dans Le Robert il me semble. Je suis contente qu'on ai plus d'options neutres en français; d'autant plus que récemment un.e de mes adelphe as fait son coming out comme étant genderfluid. (iel préfère être référé.e en langage non-genré pour l'instant)
Well, I wouldn't use he or him for example as I don't identify myself with those pronouns, and they don't describe my experience in transition.
Yes in specific cases it’s different, but even in my initial comment I was talking about in general to a person who was confusing two things and also calling neopronouns ridiculous.
[removed]
It’s honestly genuine curiosity. But I can see how one could read it that way.
because they make them feel like their gender? op's pronouns feel good because those pronouns are affirming for zhem, it makes zhem feel like zheir gender, and that's all there is to it. it's literally no different than a binary person using he/him or she/her. i don't see why that's hard to understand lmao?

&#x200B;

edit: blocked because apparently i'm being 'rude' lmao. not responding further to this thread lol
Basically I couldn't find a label that felt like it fit with my spiritual beliefs and how that relates to my gender, so I've been using post-human (the term itself was penned by my favorite musician, actually). It's kind of a disregard towards the human notion of gender and moving past that while also moving somewhat backwards in experiencing gender the way a non-human animal might; that is to say Not Really Experiencing it.

Of course with most people I just say I'm a nonbinary trans man because it's easier to say that as shorthand (and believable since I use he/him) than explaining how my werejaguar and naturism beliefs influence my interaction with gender and presentation and all that 😂 

So yeah. Post-human, and I kind of use that for sexuality, too. I just don't ascribe to any of the general human approaches to it. I am what I am, and that's not as important as what I do.
Oui c'est dans le Robert! Pour une langue particulièrement genrée, je trouve ça même surprenant haha

[removed]
I didn't entirely understand all of that but I get what you mean  I haven't had much interest in determining my sexuality or where I truly sit on that umbrella or some of the others
I'm not sure what you don't understand tbh
[removed]
I’m falling into the same boat with you with not really being able to conceptualize why someone would feel affirmed with neopronouns. Like cloudself and whatnot is very confusing to me and I’d love to understand them, but anytime you ask someone for an in-depth explanation it seems like all that’s given back is exactly what this other commenter gave. Something vague that’s not very helpful for conceptualizing
[removed]
I feel like there's a precedent set with a gendered set of pronouns or a specifically non-gendered set but with neopronouns there's no basis for those on the outside of the neo pronoun user to understand how that pronoun relates to your gender and how zhey'd like to be perceived. Not that that contributes or detracts to it's validity but it certainly adds a layer of confusion that often leads to the good old human reaction of just giving up.
I think it's like how I don't feel like or really even identify as a human I call myself an alien because of the way most of mankind is I don't use it as my pronouns now imagine if you didn't know what an alien was but still felt that way. Neopronouns are the alien which haven't been named basically I think.
That's not what I said, but transition is a process in which you learn to express yourself, pronouns are one such way to do so.
[removed]
Yourself.
[removed]
Because I don't know what answers you're expecting. You're expressing who you are, how you see yourself, the way you want to see yourself in society.

Why? What exactly is your point in asking these questions?
[removed]
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning
Uhhh, that depends on a whole lot of metaphorical and philosophical things. You didn't answer my question though, so I'll wait until then.
[removed]
Why?
[removed]
I'm not entirely sure what you were trying to learn lol, you should be a bit more clear on what you're asking and why I guess, it seems trolly to ask things the way you did.
[removed]
Well gender identity in and of itself is a complicated matter. Some of it is based in biology, some of it based on social identity, some of it based on your upbringing, etc.

Pronouns themselves are interesting because using non-standard pronouns, especially ones that are not in the usual lexicon, can be a way to express yourself in a way that you otherwise couldn't. For example, he/him typically mean masculine, she/her typically mean feminine, and they/them can mean lack of gender or something else to the effect of gender non-conforming.  
Neo-pronouns themselves imply that your gender identity is a known quantity, but one that isn't defined by the use of one of the above pronouns. Now, I don't personally use neo-pronouns myself, but I can understand why they're used; as for me using she/her (or even they/them depending on how I feel) allows me to express my inner gender identity in a way that makes me feel comfortable when I'm referred to using them, that people respect who I am and it reinforces how I feel on the inside.

I won't say that that's true for _everyone_, but it does give an overview of how I personally feel about them. To give a brief overview from before, the use of the pronouns (as an example with she/her over they/them):

1. Describe my experience as a trans person.
  - As in they describe my gender identity in a way that makes sense as to how I identify.
2. Doesn't get confused for some other meaning of my gender identity
  - As in they couldn't be mistaken for plurality, or something else that they/them would indicate that she/her doesn't.
3. These pronouns make me comfortable as who I am.
  - As in I know I'm respected in the gender identity that I am, that people aren't making some sort of assumption or otherwise don't think I'm someone that I'm not.
[removed]
That's a hard question to answer without a lot of time and investment honestly. I'll give a relatively short and overly simplified rundown though:

> how exactly do you define gender/gender identity?

(I consider gender to be gender identity in this context, as it makes it easier)  
Gender identity is an internal sense of self and that's self connection to the reality it perceives around it.

> could you explain how it links to social identity, biology, and upbringing?

I'll preface this by saying that I don't think any one of these 3 things are more important than the other, nor do I think that they're the only things that effect or link to gender identity, nor do I think that these 3 things are prerequisites to be transgender.

- The links to social identity is kinda obvious if you understand what I say in my definition above, but to expand upon it; the way you see and understand yourself, the role you place yourself in society, the role society places you, the places/people/institutions that you identify with, etc. are all ways that it links to a social identity.
- As for biological links, it's hard for me to say directly, as I mostly just listen to those that are smarter than I am, since biology is incredibly complicated! We still don't understand exactly why trans people exist, but if we try to think of how the body is an extension of the self, and gives us the ability to interact and perceive the world in a way that's impossible for the brain to do alone, then it gives us some hints as to what it could mean. Since our sense of self may conflict with the body we perceive ourselves to have, and the hormones and whatnot that effect it, that could be one way biology links to gender identity, though absolutely not the only way.
- Upbringing is interesting, as it's another way to say socialization, as in how we grow up seeing ourselves through the people and institutions that raised us. This can mean that we see ourselves in ways that are detrimental to our own mental health, or in ways that give a unique perspective on the world around us. Our gender identity would then be shaped by not only how we see ourselves through those that raise us, but also through ways we didn't see ourselves through those same people/institutions.

I hope that explains a bit of what I mean, but you could philosophize on and on about links to gender identity, how they work, what they mean, etc. etc. etc. It's a fun thing to think about, but also a bit tiring lol 😅"	xarfae	trans	1536	0.86	2022-09-10 14:58:20
my former mom basically just chose who she decided i am over who i actually am		"sorry this happened to you
That sucks, I'm sorry. 

The positive to take from this is that you know now, rather than trying to keep things amicable for years on end. It will save a lot of hurt further down the line, even if it doesn't feel like it right now
A shining example of ""all kids deserve parents, but not all parents deserve kids""

It may not feel like it right now, but that is entirely her loss, not yours.
Please do know you're not alone. My mother was exactly the same: banned me from visiting, cut me out of her will, threw away my cherished stuff in her attic, and more. Much, much more.

You get over it.  Well, not really, but you do. My consolation is that I'm finally Me, and I finally really, genuinely have a chance to be happy. I could never go back to living inauthentically.
She won’t miss you that much else she would do whatever it took to make you comfortable.
ugh I'm so sorry people suck
Adults are the worst thing that ever happened to kids. Parents especially. Sorry mate that yours managed to fail you so horribly when you asked for nothing but the right to be 

Edit: I realize that there are exceptions and in fact some adults do exist somewhere out here in this cruel universe that are good to kids and have actual healthy relationships with them. But my main point of empathizing with OP still stands
I am your grandma now
Ugh…just jeezus effing Christ. Like, no, actually, mom, I formed differently during gestation regardless of what your elementary understanding of gender is. Too bad that’s a concept you can’t fit that into your tiny head. I’m gonna have a rockin’ friggin Christmas without you guys. Oh, and mom, I’m gonna call you dad from now on to see how you like being misgendered. Hope you don’t mind!
Nice! I moved from Stl, MO to MA to avoid toxic shitty family. Worked like a charm 😆
Oh my god I’m so sorry.

Also I’d prolly reply with “💀” but that’s just me
Religion ☕
Wow that is a perfectly valid reason to never talk to her again.  I'm sorry this happened Alex
""You have made it clear you have chosen them/they"".

Woke up and decided just to be the shittiest person possible I guess
That mother of yours just needs out of your life.
""Hope you have a wonderful holiday with your new family.""

That one hit me hard ngl 😥💔
Come to /r/momforaminute anytime you need mama birds to snuggle you under our wings. 

I love you just the way you are baby bird.
Parents; I love you because you’re my baby
Child; I am trans
Parents; no you’re not because I know you better than you know yourself and my love is conditional
I am so so sorry. To be very honest for awhile I would have been the same. I was a bigoted, homophobic and transphobic a$$ h@[=. 
Mostly because I could not accept myself. I went through some VERY dark times. I pulled myself out of it. I am proud of myself for that.

Now after accepting I am MtF I am a much much kinder person. All I have is empathy for anyone struggling. I do not judge anyone anymore. I am a Christian also. I believe I am made in the image of God. I also live by the true teachings of Jesus. Love one another and don't judge. 

That right there is all I need to live by. I will help anyone if they need it.

So maybe have a little hope she will change. That's all we can ask for. 

I hope your journey through life is filled with Joy and kindness. Take care.
>""Your Momma""

After all this, about how I'm not your child anymore, you sign off with that?

No further comment, fucking wow.
I love you so much

but doesnt respect your wishes and perfers to not see you instead...
Ugh, religion fucking minorities over yet a-bloody-gain
Classic example of a parent loving their idea of who their kid is, rather their actual kid.  Sorry that you're dealing with this shit, OP.  I know what it's like, and it does eventually get easier.  Hope you're safe and well. ❤️
Yeah, it was the same with my mom... I'm sorry for you :(
I have no useful advice but wanted to say that's a lovely wallpaper! Where'd you get it?
This is not ok. I would cry 🙁
i don't have any good advice but I have all the sympathy for you. it's not easy and I'm so sorry, my heart is basically cracking apart for you :( it sounds like you at least have a good partner, I hope you have a good support system outside of him too. at least now you know how she feels and there won't be room to hang on, hoping she'll accept you as alex when she clearly doesn't even want to try.
this was kind of my parents reaction at first, but now they've been better at it. they've said that sometimes they can't help but see their daughter, and that's all they'll see when looking back, but at least they're accepting that from now on I'm their son.
I wish you could have a similar, better experience to mine, but I know that's not really possible. just know that you will, even if not right now, eventually find your real family, the ones who accept you just as you are. there is still joy to be found, even if it won't come from her.
sorry this got kinda long, and idk how close you were to her but it probably still hurts either way. if it makes you feel any better, I think Alex is a great nonbinary name, and it was actually one of my top 5 name choices before i picked a name lol. I'm proud of you for choosing yourself and your identity tho.
you have an entire community and not to be cheesy, rainbow family, who already think you're great
Damn this is exactly how my mom responds to me about stuff like this. I hate the flowery language used to cover up the fact she is saying “no I won’t accept you”. It really sucks, hope it gets better for you.
Block that awful woman
I'm sorry but your first mesaage is cut off perfectly. 
>I don't like being.
This whole thing infuriates me. She is acting like she loves you but that is bullshit.
I am in the exact same situation as you with my parents, though I am MtF. My mom says the same type of things to me. Calling me she would be the biggest lie she’s ever told and she won’t take part in “my delusions”. But she wants to be around me and says “I will look beneath the surface and see my son!” So no thanks. And she literally spins it that I am disowning her, because I refuse to allow that type of narrow minded abuse in my life. 
I’ve given up on her. We have had a lot of these types of disowning ultimatum chats. She always comes back to argue with the same bs. But continues to treat my name like the dirtiest cuss word and vows to only see and treat me as her son. The last one (this morning) seemed more final so maybe she will stay away now.
As a birthing parent to babies and a toddler, fuck your egg donor. If my kids tell me they're a different gender/name one day, then so be it. Cuddling and singing and playing with kids is the bare minimum. God this shit enrages me.
This hurts to read. You deserve so much better
So she cares more about her own feelings than the happiness and well-being of her own child.  That really shows love right there, disowning someone over a four letter word. 🙄
I'm so sorry, man. I hope you have a kickass holiday without your parents.
That's terrible. I feel so sorry for you. 

Still, it's good that that bridge has been burned and now you can move forward without them. If they don't want you, you don't need them. You can make a new family with your bf and all of the other friends you've made along the way. If your blood relatives don't want to be a part of that family, you can proudly leave them behind and go on to greener pastures.
Parents can be absolutely horrible sometimes...I'm truly sorry yours are on the wrong side of the fence. >\_<  
\*offers a pair of scissors to cut the strings\*
Tell her to go fuck herself
Sounds like something my mom would say. Any time we talked about how I was trans and my name wasn’t my deadname anymore I was roped into listening to her spiel about how at midnight in december just after i was born the christmas clock would chime and she would rock her sweet deadname in her arms… etc etc. idgaf. she still deadnames me all the time, only ever names me correctly around my friends parents to keep up appearances. can’t wait to finally move out. 7 months to go!
my mom did this too, im so sorry :( i hope you have people who do \*actually\* support you <3
Seriously parents pulling the ""We'll miss you so much and we love you"" line is such bullshit. If they actually miss you they'd learn to accept who you are.

Hopefully your parents do what mine did and accept that you are who you are, and realise that they'll lose you otherwise. If they really loved you they would want you in their lives.
Ah yes. The holidays. When we gather together as families and share the love! /s

Dealing with this BS myself as I try to figure out what my supportive family is up to while avoiding the less than supportive ones. I hope your holidays are good, friend.
Let her wallow in misery, it’s her own doing
That really sound like my mother, the manipulation and her way of showig ""love and support"".
Today when I was coming back home I came to the conclusion that my parents love their Son, not their daughter; they love someone that doesn't exist and try to erase me, in a poor attempt to ""bring back"" their son.
As someone who nearly lost her mom to attitudes like this (minus the religious aspect of it) I feel so much for you. 

My mom and I never completely cut each other out of our lives but things did become very rough between us for several years. She eventually came around and is now one of my biggest supporters, people's attitudes and hearts can change - it does happen, especially when it's their kids and they see the harm it's causing.

**huggs**
thats that
It's always freaking God 😒... my mom is doing the same. So I feel you OP. 

""If God wanted me to have 2 daughters I would've had 2."" Like if you don't stfu about some invisible fucking sky person. If God wanted me to see I guess I would be able to see. So no more glasses for me.
If you can’t love your children for who they really are then you shouldn’t have had children. Your “mom” is selfish and you deserve better.
People are so f****** selfish, some should just sign legal documents agreeing to never have kids.
Sorry this happened but at least she's not pretending
Fuck, Alex. I’m so sorry
It's amazing, isn't...these pseudo-religious types always so happy to trot out 'God made you, so...' in support of their own selfish, vainglorious bullshit, but never 'God made you trans, so...' as a way of saying 'I'm going to need some time to adjust, but you have my support...' to their children.
Damn I'm so sorry this happened to you .
I understand some parents go through the grieving process on coming  outing ,but the amount of times I've read this exact thing happen is troubling .
I had the grieving and arguing on mine the first time I tried and stupidly I climbed back into the closet for her sake .
I tried again a few years later and explained it In much better detail and now she has a daughter and were best friends even if she hates my chosen name .
I've always said the best family is the one you choose to be with not always the one your born into.
Best wishes on your journey.
Alice.
so i have a few comments, so i will number them for convenience and comprehension  


1. if/when you actually cut contact, she will act like you personally shot her in the chest with an actual cannon
2. there is still hope. i thought i wouldn't make it to 21. i'm in my 30s now and i'm actually... happy? the world is going to piss but i don't want to kill myself every day and i'm surrounded by people who love and care about me and not their construction of me 
3. feel free to message me if you want to ask any questions about leaving a shitty family and moving 1000 miles away
When god is written on these screenshots, it often ends up being a nono
I'm sorry bud 😢 x
Wowwww how incredibly shitty
I'm mom to a 26 year old trans man and his 23 year old cis brother.
My love for my son's is unconditional and I knew my son was trans before he did ( I've known since he was 3 years old).
The only thing I want in life for my kids is to be happy.
I'm sorry Alex...need a hug?
I'm so sorry this happened to you
Holy fuck that sucks.. I'm sorry you're going through this shit bro... your ask was NOT a big deal. Period. It was a simple honest request and she can't fucking handle? Nah, you fucking suck lady. Your son loves you and you spat in his face. Get fucked.
I'm so sorry ur dealing with that...I recently had to end all contact with my mom bc she refuses to accept me for who I am...there r sad times, but the mental peace I have without dealing with her is absolutely worth it
This is my mom in a nutshell. She loves to shove my baby/younger photos in my face as ""proof"" of my AGAB. Ugh. I'm so sorry, Alex.
I'm sorry that happened to you.  You have a toxic mom and that sucks.
Wow, amazing that your parent even thought you were plural women. Seriously, I am so sorry, that is not a loving parent. You deserve for them to acknowledge you and I'm so sorry they won't.
Why do parents think we suddenly morph into a totally different person that they don't know anymore? You ARE the child she sang to and made lovely memories with. You are just also nonbinary at the same time. Parents treat kids coming out as if they've died. I guess she's ""mourning the loss of her [agab] kid"" but there isn't actually any loss to mourn.. it's the same person, same memories, same child, her child, just nonbinary. Dang it's frustrating. I get it purely from a them-being-ignorant perspective, but damn is it damaging. This is really sad.
I am so sorry. I’m not old enough to be a parent figure. But I will always be a sibling for anytime. I love and accept you for the amazing and wonderful person you are.
some people really rather their kids dead than trans aren't they....
Ew. Sorry this happened to you. Even when people are like “bUt theYre fAmiLy” it’s like… what is that supposed to do? Give them leeway to mistreat a person? 

I hope all the best for you. Getting that toxicity out of your life will have been worth it. Good luck 💕
My mother said something like that to me and it sucks.
Good riddance, that type of behavior will only get worse after time
That is fucked up, I am so sorry that you have to deal with that, you are an amazing entity and I applaud your determination to not give up
don’t take advice from somebody who can’t spell woman correctlly
I don’t mean to be rude but what a terrible parent. If someone is going to a bring a child into the world they should be expected to love them unconditionally and without question, no matter what their identity entails. It’s absolutely sickening to see this, I’m sorry that you’ve had to deal with this. It’s better for you in the long run to not have to deal with such a bad influence. Hope the best for you.
Well it's time to make yourself happy. Families are tough to get along with at times. But you have to move on and make your own decisions and create your own life. God bless and stay safe 💕
Oof. I’m in the same kind of family. Glad I finally get to spend Christmas with people who actually love and support me. Good on you for sticking to your boundaries. They don’t love you, they love their version of their child. You won’t be missing much.
I am sorry you're going through this. 

You are very strong and brave for coming out to a person who does not accept you for who you are and standing up for yourself repetedly. You can be very, very proud of yourself.

I hope your mum will come round one day but until then your life is probably much less stressful without someone around who keeps deadnaming you and judging you. So this break is probably a healthy thing. And if she loves you as much as she says - which I do believe - she will miss you, her beautiful child she sang to when they were still a baby, so much that she will understand that this is a topic in its essence too trivial to get stuck up over. Calling someone something different takes a week of getting used to and then it feels like it has never been any other way.

I wish you all the best and I wish I was as brave as you. I am still very much in the closet and I have been for many, many years.

My response: ""Dearest Mother, fuck you""
Holy shit that was seething with entitlement and arrogance. I am surprised she had time to mention God since she obviously think she rules over the world. 
Seriously, it’s sad and fucked up. But that level of self importance and narcism is almost hilarious. Like a parody come to life. 

But on a serious note. Your mother has made a decision to not accept you and to actively reject you and tell you to find a new home. 
I can be a bit extreme but for me this is the equivalent of a parent saying ‘I don’t love you’. Which is probably a bit accurate they love you when you were closeted and faked. The real you they don’t love. 

Burn an effigy of your mom and call that bridge burned.
Your mom’s loss there, now she gets 1 less Christmas gift (if anyone would give a gift to someone like that anyway)
Your mom loves a fake version of yourself. You deserve better :(

Also nice Basil pfp :)
If you want you can send these. If she still isn’t convinced it’s probably not worth trying anymore.

Good lord! Humans can really suck. Also I’m jealous of your mom’s womb now, cause I’m insane ig.
i beat my parents to the punch and disowned them
Proud of you for making that effort of explaining yourself for your mom. Sorry your mom didn’t make an effort for you.. 💔
Its aright, ill pick up the peices and move on
Yeah, i don't have to bother with her anymore
She definitely did not deserve kids, not if she is so willing to throw them away the moment they aren't exactly who she wants them to be
“a parent’s love for their child should be unconditional, where a child’s love to their parent is conditional”
Oh wow she sounds batshit crazy, that must have been rough. Im glad you can be who you really are
I hear stories of this and also stories where the parents eventually come around and wonder if number of children has anything to do with it. If you don't mind me asking are you an only child or do you have siblings?
The sad thing is that she probably will miss them so so so much, but she’s putting up a whole spiel to prove that her god’s right. Ugh.

She’ll either live with the agonic inner knowledge that she entirely fucked up and lost her kid to something trivial, or she’ll realize the love for her kid is greater than whatever god and come back apologizing.

Sending love your way OP! I’m so glad you do already have a family you chose for yourself, those are the best! <3
Yeah, i put up with the deadnaming and misgendering for so long until i had enough and the moment i stuck up for myself i get disowned
Please do not generalize. There are some absolutely great and wonderful parents who know that their job as parents is to unconditionally love and help their children grow, become good people and never **expect** the least of even a “thank you”.

My personal situation is the opposite: I came out to my daughter and our relationship changed exponentially - to the better. We are closer than ever before. But still, even if my daughter had rejected me, I would still had always loved and supported her - my job as parent.
Lol yeah, i am gonna have a great Christmas without her!
Thank you also lol that emoji would fit thie context
And they say Christianity isn't a cult....
Yeah, i assumed she would at least try to argue with me or something but she didn't even care enough to put up a fight
“We will miss you” made me so angry honestly… like no you don’t, you’re the one cutting them off dickhead.
She has to make herself feel better by acting like who i am is a choice i guess
Well she is now, i assume that was her disowning me
Im sorry if you have been through something similar :(
Thank you, i might use it if im ever missing mine
The day you comes out of the closet is the day is the day you learn if your parents lied when they said they would always love you no matter what when you were a infant.
Thank you so much for being a kind Christian, and not like the one who birthed me. Its so sad to see her so stuck in her own head that she can't see what she's doing. She so stuck in the past. Good on you for growing and changing to be a better person
I love finding more trans christians, it makes me feel less alone.
Yeah, she still thinks she has the title of ""mom"" hah hell no
She loves the girl that lives rent free in her head, she doesn't even see me
Sadly her religion is more important than me
Yup, she loves someone that is in her head, not me which is sad. I hope it gets easier, this happened last night and i literally got a massive headache from it, i cried a tiny bit listening to music, took like 3 Melatonin and then crashed
Im sorry you had to go through that to, i hope you are doing okay
I got it off Google and yes i was that petty to make the backround for my birthers chatroom the enby flag
I did a tiny bit, but she doesn't deserve my tears so i won't cry for her
I was close to her as a young child but once i became a teenager it all fell apart and we haven't been close in years but it does still hurt like hell and it pisses me off, im mainly just angry right now. Angry that she could even think like this. Im glad your parents came around and maybe one day mine will to but i doubt it and i wont be holding my breath
Yeah, she has to make herself look better and not like an asshole so she drowns whatever she is saying in blissfull memories that don't hold any weight anymore
I will don't worry
Lol yeah, the rest was me saying i dont like being called my deadname and pronouns ans that the only exeption to that is if we are around other people who don't know that im non-binary
It is, she loves her idea of me but not me
That really sucks im so sorry, you deserve so much better than that. I felt like my former mother was also trying to spin it around to put me at fault. My bf texted her and said ""i thought you were better than that"" and she went on a whole spiral of how she doesn't believe you can change your sex and that she was not going to change her views, how we just needed to respect each other (what she really wants is for me to just lie down and except her disrespect) she acts like her bigotry is something she was born with, like no bitch that is a learned behavior and is very much a choice unlikee being trans
Yeah, im gonna call her egg donor that is amazing. Thank you for being the parent to your kids that i and many others couldn't have ❤
She's always been like that, she's selfish and always has been
Im sure i will, thank you for the support
Yeah im somewhat glad to, im relieved i don't have to worry about her anymore, im probably not going to feel happy about it for awhile, i did just loose my mom so thats not easy but i know i had to do it, i had to stand up for myself
*takes scissors and violently cuts strings*
Im tempted but i honestly think it would be better to just not say anything else, i already know she's made up her mind and won't change
Wow that sucks, im sorry but im glad you grt to move out in 7 months, may feel like forever but it will fly by before you know it!
My bf and roomates do, and all of you guys
Yeah, i know whats going on in her head, she's not lying when she said she loves [my deadname] but the thing is thats not me anymore. She can't let go of the past so she doesn't even see who ive grown to be
I hope you are able to figure it out smoothly. Thank you i will
Exactly
I never really wanted to say my egg donor is manipulative but she really is, and also narcissistic. Im sorry you have a ""mom"" like that to. My egg donor loves the girl she knew but refuses to know and love the person i really am but i dont need her, i have my bf who loves me and i have the little gay people in my phone lol
Yeah, she is so brainwashed by fundamentalist Christianity and who she wants me to be she will make herself the victim
She is so selfish its astounding to me. I wish i had a mom that loved me unconditionally
Yeah i suppose, makes my life easier...somewhat anyways
Its okay but thank you
Yeah, i have left the doors open if she ever wants come back but she will have to open her mind and heart to who ive grown to be. She will need to let go of the past and embrace the future. I dont know if she ever will come back, but no matter what happens i will not be the one to apologize or shove myself back into the closet for her sake, i already tried that to, i tried to just let her walk all over me but i had enough. Im so glad that your mom came around and you have a good relationship with her
I just cut contact with my mom earlier, she doesn't really seem to phased by it, at least with how she worded everything but who knows maybe she's crying her eyes out wondering why i would do such a thing like not let her do whatever the fuck she wants. This is difficult and everything feels weird right now but I'll be okay. I already live on my own a few hours away from them (well apparently they are moving so idk how far away i will be but it doesn't really matter, i don't think she's crazy and will barge into my home or anything and if for some reason she does ill call the police i guess
I'll take one, thank you
Yeah i didn't think it was a big ask either but apparently to her it was such a big ask that she would rather stop talking to me
Honeslty now that you mention it she kinda did the samw thing, she would send a random old photo of me for no reason and just say something random about it but idk if that was out of malice or not but it is interesting
Yeah she's pretty toxic, wish i had a different mom ngl
Lol i didn't even notice she used the wrong word there. I do feel like i deserve to be treated with respect and if she won't do that then i wont talk to her
Yeah, i mean i can understand it being a loss of sorts ans it get it would take time to get used to but shes not even trying, shes trying to guilt trip me and tried to pin the blame on me and act like i caused this
Well i love and except you to, thank you internet sibling
Oh yeah i dont care about the ""but family!!!11!1"" like bitch i can make my own family lol
Yeah, im glad i cut her out
*undertale theme plays* lol sorry i had to make that joke but thank you, i was tired of just letting her grt her way at the expense of my mental health
Yeah, wants to tell me im a woman but can't even use the proper word
Oh trust me you aren't being rude, i made an update to this and literally changed her contact to ""egg donor"" because i literally don't consider her my mom anymore, a mother doesn't do this shit
Well i am getting a haircut Tuesday thats a start at making myself happy, thank you for the nice message and thsnks to everyone else who has left such nice and supportive comments
Yeah, the part where she specifically says ""deadname, whom i love"" like yeah....im not that person anymore so she basically made it clear to me that im not who she loves, she loves someone thats in her head
Still sucks though, im sorry i hope you can recover and appreciate your new found family💞
I totally get this. To a certain extent we have to be resilient. I hated having to mask and hide behind that. If you need to and can without being severely impacted in financial or safety ways (i.e. don't make yourself homeless), no or low contact may be a decent option. Please continue to be you and be safe. It does get better over time in most cases, and if not, you're better off without them.
100% this. Her job is to make sure you're loved and supported so you can figure the person you are and be equipped to handle the world. Her job isn't to make automatons that behave according to her wants
Oh, it's worse than you think.  Jax FL is the bottom of the Deep South and the Bible Belt; it's *extremely* good 'ol boy / Patriarchal.  When Mother died, two of my brothers got an injunction against me so if I went to her funeral, I'd be arrested.

I didn't go, of course.  Mother died just before Christmas; the Hearing was just after.  I went, assuming they wouldn't show up - they'd gotten the results they wanted.  They showed up; told the Judge *they were afraid of me*; a transgender woman then 65.  They, now in their early 50s, were each former Football stars; one a proud CCW license holder who is even prouder of his Glock; the other a former semi-pro Boxer.  While I assumed the judge would drop/dismiss the complaint, not *only* did he uphold it, he made it valid for my lifetime.

Years later, I self-sued my brothers in seeking my share of an inheritance despite the revised wording of Mother's Will - they refused, claiming I'm *incompetent*.  In court, to demonstrate my ""incompetence"" (bc I'm transgender), their attorney asked me ""Why... would a *man*... want to become a *woman?*"" (implying that any male who wanted/claimed to be female *must be* incompetent).  I didn't like his condescending,  arrogant & belligerent attitude, so I looked him dead in the eye and responded ""I *just wanted to get a little pussy.*..""

Judge *SLAMMED!* his gavel down so hard I thought would break and admonished me not to provide any smart-alec answers in HIS courtroom, then repeated the question.  This time I just looked at him, shrugged my shoulders & held my hands up: ""Your Honor, a *man*... *WOULDN'T*... want to become a woman..."" 

After maybe 10-12 seconds of the longest silence in my lifetime, I added, ""Sir, would *you* want to *have periods* and *give bir*...""  He curtly barked, ""He'd take my answer under advisement.""

I was found to be competent.  Oh, and I won my case, despite my brother's law firm assistance and the language in Mother's will.

Despite all this and much more... being your True Self is *soooooooooooooo* worth it!
7 brothers and two sisters.  Never did come around.

FYI, and just for fun: Father, MD / Surgeon (suicide); 1 brother, Priest; 1 brother Attorney, 1 brother, MD / OB/GYN (deceased / suicide); 1 brother, deep sea fishing captain; 1 brother, dog-catcher / Rain Man-type; 1 brother, *finally* now dying; alcoholism (obv. no lost love there!), former semi-pro boxer; 1 brother, set a World Speed Record racing Cigarette Boats (think *Miami Vice*); 1 sister, MD / Neurosurgeon; 1 sister, editor of a prominent newspaper.

**All of them, transphobic**; don't believe ""transgender"" exists.  The two sisters are both lesbian / TERFs.  All of them made it challenging for me growing up.

If she does come back running i will open my arms but its up to her
I'm super happy for you both! I apologize for my generalization as there certainly are parents, such as yourself as it would seem, who not only avoid passing on trauma to their kids but even raise them well. I'll edit my comment to reflect that. It's just so rare that I see anyone like that, and in all my years the only thing I've seen adults do (with exactly 1 exception) for children is shred their innocence and drive their very souls from their body. It's not always their fault, many stand to be fired if they don't. I just got a bit emotional and I apologize for forgetting that there are good folks like you who are raising children right
Excellent. 😎✌️
I mean. They do. Because it is. Maybe the people stuck in it don't admit it, but, it is definitely a cult.
Please stop generalising. Not all religious people are like this. Some of us genuinely take the teachings of Jesus to heart and want to share His love with everyone
I'm sorry. I support you.
Yeah same, like she tried to spin it like i was somehow the one cutting them off
I've always got a hug if you need it.

One of the bittersweet things about being queer/trans is mourning bio family but then finding your chosen family.
I just found some devotionals for lgbtq+ and 1 is especially for trans and non binary. I just started them today.
If it wasnt for laws, it scares me what some of these people would do. I could never come out until im away from family. My grandparents talk about how they wish they could round up all the “gays, muslims, and immigrants” and shoot them all in the head and fix the country or whatever nonsense they cook up. I give it a very real chance i would be killed if i xame out and im in america which I always learned when i was young in school here that this is the home of the free and all that. I guess free is for straight people only, the rest of us are free to die i guess. I cant wait to get moved out im so scared they will find out before i can.
I think it gets easier in the sense that you eventually get to a place where you can deal with the hurt more efficiently, but it's been about 2 years since I cut ties with my parents and the hurt of not having parents to lean on doesn't go away.  It's a situation that just sucks and it's ok to have bad days, but there will also be good days.  The hope is that the good days become more frequent and the bad days, less bad.  But most importantly, just remember to lean on your supports.
Good for you! I’m proud
Yeah I understand but honestly I sympathize with the cut off message
Well I don't know you but I love you for being you;
What you said is word for word the same as my mom
She's definitely not a mother that's for sure. And ty ❤️ trying to be the parent that I couldn't have either
Oh it's easy. I just don't show up. And I'm getting top surgery 12/21 so I have a very valid excuse not to go anywhere lol
I might be gay but so are you and, oh crap, I love you too
No hate like Christian love.
*hugs* 

always
I wish you did too. I'm so sorry.
Totally fair!
Then good for you, and I love undertale lmao, such a good game
I’m happy for you that you can rationalize it, even if it doesn’t make it feel better right now. You’ll feel better in the long run, just gotta give it time! I’m sure great things will come your way now that you are more free to be you.
I believe in you 💕
Sounds like she’s religious, too. It’s a whole epidemic in especially fundie circles :/
Yeah, this honestly was the best option for me, ive moved out and been living without their help for awhile now. Its a bit surreal tho, i can't believe I've cut contact with my mom. Everything feels weird and its upsetting but its also empowering and liberating at the same time
Holy shit thats a lot. Im glad you won tho, good for you
That is a glorious and amazing win. Brava and well done! ❤️‍🩹🙏🌻🌈
Oh yeah I’m totally on your side! That’s some fucked up shit. Nonetheless, she will live with a subconscious dread of having made that wrong choice, because hidden behind all of her (un)reasoning, there must be love for her kid, therefore guilt and longing.
if taking her back is on the table, 100% maintain your red lines and do not let her slack up. these are good boundaries you have and you should maintain them at all cost.
Thank you, and thank you for updating your message. 😘
Step one of being in a cult, never call it a cult
A religion is just a cult with a lot of followers
I think there is a difference between fundamental Christians and ""regular""(for lack of a better term) Christians. fundamentalism is not okay and is very cult like but if you are not like that then i wouldn't say you are in any cult
I’m sorry you had to deal with that.
Bigotry and ridiculous self-victimization always go hand in hand.
That's sooo cooool <33
Yeah, i mean i don't feel super crushed by it, mostly because i somewhat expected this i guess. It still hurts but not super bad or anything. Idk maybe it will get worse once it settles in a little more that i don't have a mom anymore but we haven't had a stable relationship for probably like 5+ years now so that also makes it hurt less, its not like we were super close or anything
Yeah me to 🫂
Thank you
Yay
Yeah shes pretty religious
**Karma is a Bitch.**

One brother was been diagnosed early this year with *Advanced Cirrhosis of the Liver with Complications*... and he won't be around to see Christmas. He had opened a Personal Checking Account in *his* name and put MY inheritance in it... I feared that had he died before I could get it, my money would have become part of *his* Estate and gone to his widow (whom he hasn't lived with for 32 years) and their two adult sons...

He never *dreamed* I'd sue him on my own, *while he retained a lawyer to not pay me*.  **I won!; he lost, and I got my money.**  And, he \*just\* got out of the hospital - *again*, so I sent him a couple of cards:

*May you find comfort*

*In knowing that others are*

*Holding you close in their hearts*

*During this difficult time*

***(At least as long as they think you still have my money!)***

&#x200B;

***(As I think of you facing the Fires of Hell...)***

*I'm sending you the warmest holiday greetings*

*To you and your family*

&#x200B;

*May each day of rest bringYou closer to good health!*

***(Well – it would – but I'm not coming over!)***

&#x200B;

**The BOLD parts are what I added via handwriting....**

Revenge is a dish that tastes best when it's cold...
TY.   I \*am\* particularly proud of my accomplishment, in that I won despite having zero training in law, courtroom protocols, researching case law, making rebuttals or closing arguments - and facing a highly experienced, educated trained attorney who was a former State Attorney.  

Don't mistake that was easy; I \*did\* put the hours in to read how to do all that, and I was scared to death at every moment because *this was Real* \- not a rehearsal.  I made plenty of mistakes, but the Judge allowed me leeway because of it - and I listened carefully to his criticism; even as he admonished me, he was 'guiding' me.

Yeah, I could have done that as a profession; if I wasn't intimidated in real life, I could definitely have handled it if I'd known what / how to do.  I won't use the word, ""fun""; the stakes were far too high for that - but it was immensely satisfying.
There is not ALWAYS love for the kid.
Oh i will, if she wants me to talk to her again she will have to put in the effort
cults are a lot like dumb business decisions, trow shit at a wall and see what sticks.
and an IRS tax status
A religion is a cult that's deemed acceptable to follow
Yeah you’re right, I was giving humanity a bit of hope after having several days of tough discussions about this topic and many similar ones lol
That just sounds like religion with extra steps xP

Just got my boobs. Thought they were maybe a touch too small and then I put on this dress. Now I'm very happy with some curves.		"You look great, and yeah they're the right size for your body type :)

Also, if you JUST got them...they'll continue to ""drop and fluff"" and will only look better as time goes on. Take it from me! ;-)

P.S - Love your Youtube channel!
You have great curves beautiful
Nah don't worry, they're perfect. Any bigger and it would have started to look ridiculous because you're so ... well fuck, now my vocabulary is failing me. 

There's a German word that is a mix between fragile and elegant, and I have no clue if there's an English translation that fits. 

What I'm trying to say is you are very pretty.
They suit you really well. Your curves look great in that dress. 😄
😍😍
Happy for you, Looking very gorgeous!
Congrats & nice home
You are beautiful and they are perfect
*Stunning*
Pretty 😍😘
You look beautiful girl, well done
Too small? I wish mine were that big 😪
They're not small for your body! A good amount of body fat goes to your boobs so chances are you'd really fill out if you gained some weight. I know that can be tough for some people. I have a few friends struggling to put on weight. One of them is afab and complains about her boobs being too small and too pointy, when body fat usually rounds them out.
You look great girl. I wish that I had your figure. Your stunning.
Think we all are happy with them curves you got babe
Very nice
you look good!!congrats!!
Okay, we get it, you're hotter than everybody, no need to rub it in our faces like that 🙄🙄🙄

Jk jk, you look really good and yeah boobs are pretty cool 😁
They look really natural! The size is perfect this way!
They fit you perfectly!

P.S  So glad you posted this today; it lead me to discover your YouTub channel. Love!
You look amazing!
They fit you perfectly. You look  so amazing

Nice boobs. 👍🏽

You look sooo fine! Bewb envy. 🥺
🔥🔥
This might be a dumb question, but breast forms or BA?
Boobs always look smaller unless there pushed down or together I’ve noticed
They are just right with your slim figure
You look amazing! Love the curves
Gorgeous came out perfect where’d you go?
Girl, you look fabulous!
Perfect for you frame.  Gorgeous.
the size looks completely natural on you, they definitely fit your body type! your dress is beautiful too you look amazing 💚
Hope you enjoy your bewbs miss
Uh, you totally stole this from Ashley A- *sees flair*....nvm, you purrty, carry on.
You look sexy and amazing! I also have really enjoyed how deep and profound you go on your YouTube channel while at the same time being light-hearted and fun.:) Lots of wisdom there Girl! Keep on soaring and shining ! Big fan here...
Fits you just right🥰
Just saw one of your older comments- was wondering if you ended up going to Dr Stanton for the hip/butt implant? Thank you XX
So, I’m scrolling through Reddit cause I can’t sleep, and stumble upon this post. Think,oh it’s so nice to see everyone so positive on a r/plasticsurgery post, then finally realized where I am. 

This is a great post, I’m so happy for you, you look amazing.
Thanks! Glad you dig my channel! ... Re: Boobs Yeah that was the thing I was struggling with was my body type (wide shoulders narrow hips) and size. It's hard to find the right curvature when you dont have a lot to work with. Basically the side profile of my butt lol and boobs. I wanted 400 cc to start, but the surgeon talked me down to 360 saying it actually balanced me out more. I thought that might be too small but after looking in the mirror last night with this photo, I was like YES. This was right.
thx!
i think OP lives in berlin. regardless i'm curious to know what that word is :)
Aww thanks! Whats the German word? I need to learn German since I just moved to Berlin lol
thank you!!!
>Think we all are happy with them curves you got babe

I know what you mean girl. What I mean is when you have a choice to choose any size and you learn that you chose the smallest size, I had to ask myself. Did I go too small?
Yeah I can't gain weight, it's very difficult to maintain it. I can do caloric excess but that feels unsustainable. I tried to grow my boobies the old fashioned way of lots of calories, protein shakes before bed, and bags of cashews. no dice!
Thank you babe!
I was feeling hot in this! Thanks babe :)
>Guess this is the only time I can say this without being a perv . Nice tits girl

hahaha you can always say that around me lol
thank you!
BA, she has a really thoughtful YouTube channel; check it out.
What is a breast form?
Good tip, I can't wait to try a push up bra once I get out of this surgical one.
Dr Chiu is an artist. Very detailed and focussed and knowledgable. Not super expensive as I expecting fairly close to market rate around LA. ~$11k
https://www.beverlyhillsplasticsurgeryinc.com/medispa/
ahh thank you thank you!!
HAHAH OMG thank you for catching me!!! lolz
Oh no I decided against it Because it wouldn’t look very natural and it was not encouraged by my breast surgeon. So we just worked around it.
I could also not sleep lol so I post this. LOL I'm so glad I totally passed for r/plastisurgery lol
>  I wanted 400 cc to start, but the surgeon talked me down to 360 saying it actually balanced me out more.

Hah, that was exactly the same for me! And yeah it's definitely worth listening to the surgeon regarding size...at 4 months post it's obvious any bigger would have been way out of proportion with my hips.
In this case, I would have used zart or zerbrechlich.
I was thinking of zart, but zerbrechlich and filigran work too in this context!

Our ""fragile"" (zerbrechlich) has a weirdly positive connotation when applied to women. Maybe because there's a certain preciousness and grace associated with it. Basically, despite ballerinas being strong af, we'd call them zerbrechlich because they are often skinny and graceful, and as beautiful as porcelain dolls.

The kind of porcelain doll that's not evil and possessed looking.

Also once restaurants open back up: if you like piano bars, go to ""Vincent"" for a few awesome cocktails, and if you like Vietnamese food, ""Mother's Heart"" was freaking great.

I'd normally be in Berlin around this time of year, so I am pretty sad about not seeing any plays and having a French Martini after. 

Enjoy the city, it's a great place to be :3
You're welcome. 😄 Love your YouTube videos too.
Awww thanks hun!
took this from a website: "" Breast forms are prosthetic breasts that some women, transfeminine folks, and femme-of-centre folks choose to wear underneath their day-to-day clothing. There are many different kinds of forms that range in quality, shape, and material. Some styles are contoured to create a smooth transition from body to form, and can be worn directly against the skin, or tucked inside a bra. There are two forms in a set and, depending on the style, they are available in symmetrical and asymmetrical designs.""
Yea I mean dunno if that’s really how it works but I mean worth a try ig
My friend went to cg in Miami paid like 5 for 650cc
Dang sister high five for the 360 squad
Everything is closed for now! I am actually in San Francisco about to get FFS. Thanks for the education and also the compliment I love the idea of being her gentle fragile doll!
ooooohhhh, yeah i tried those a while ago when prototyping surgery
I know, German lockdown is strict af. Weirdly enough I miss eating out the most.

Good luck with your FFS, and a speedy recovery! <3"	kz13s3	trans	1535	0.98	2021-01-17 06:22:57

I might be downvoted to hell but you need to hear this: one of the right wing groups I’m in who is usually making fun of …some certain situations brought this post there and most comments are super positive and say how you pass and kinda hot. You’re literally even being accepted and liked in a hate group 💕
Straight guy here, popped up in my recommend.  I would never know, amazing.  Looking good!
Sooooo cute!
You are not a princess you are a queen! 🥰
E, spiro and progesterone
Ohh it just takes time, makeup tutorials never really helped me but spending time working with my face has been the best improvement on my skills! Thank you!
I thought it was two huge skin tags fml
Hehe thank you! And yeah I forget I have them. It takes like one day to get used to them.
Your brain kinda blocks out your nose from your visual range anyways. Try looking down and then closing 1 eye.
Thank you!
Nice, I’m ftm but amazed at the changes E does for your faces
NOOOOOO
No problem, you’re totally a princess, though I would say you always were😆💕💖❤️
YES IM SORRY I felt horrible when I realized 💀🥲"	xgsspw	trans	1486	0.99	2022-09-17 17:42:23
Please can someone help me formulate a reply to this?? I can't see past my anger. My daughter is 12 and has been out and happy for 18mths. She has no dysmorphia over her genitals and hasn't decided if she wants the op yet. Can someone in my daughter's position please help me formulate a reply?		"Tbh, they don’t seem like a friend at all. No real friend would be this disrespectful about someone else’s child. They clearly need to educate themselves because yikes, what they’ve said is so ignorant.
I'm so sorry that this person pretends to be your friend. If that where about me or my child I would simply reply that you are entitled to your wrong opinion and then block them right away and cut them out of and my and my child's life.
Strongly consider not speaking to or associating with this person anymore. No 12 year old needs that in her life, I hope she doesn't have to interact with that very transphobic person.

Whatever you do or say, good luck 😊💜
I think you should politely but firmly tell her that your daughter is none of her business. Why on earth does she think she can bring up a 12 year old's genitals on social media? That in itself is completely out of line. 

Also you can get change the narrative. Hit her with some links like the [Mayo](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/childrens-health/in-depth/children-and-gender-identity/art-20266811#:~:text=Most%20children%20typically%20develop%20the,gender%20by%20age%203%20years.) Clinic saying kids understand their gender by 3. Her comments made it clear she has no idea what the transition process is. 

This lady is deranged and needs to be blocked from all your social media. Toxic people like that aren't worth your or your daughters energy.
I wanna say that that she was never a typical boy and that she might not have the op but not having it doesn't make her any less of girl , that the op would only be in many years to come anyway and so fucking what if she decides she wants to de-transition anyway.... My job is to love and support her.
Can someone give me views on how it feels to be a young person who is born in the wrong body, and what it means to be supported during the transition? 
My daughter can't express how she feels to me cuz she isn't great with words.
 The only thing she ever says is that she's much happier being a girl, but I feel this isn't going to be enough to shut my friend up.
""no purpose other than to serve another man"" wow. What a mysoginyst creep
For starters I am 50yo MTF and transitioning for two and a half years. Half of my life has been waisted in someone else’s body. I have dealt with depression and self medication and never was allowed to even think I had a feminine side. You see I told my parents when I was five that this was all wrong I needed to be a girl. I wanted to be a girl. It was cute for a while as they brushed it off. Until I was about 9 years old then it was diets it was camps and beatings and punishment until I left the girlie things go. But as you can tell here I am 50 years later trying to be myself again. I can’t believe that any parent would sentence their child to a life time of pain, denial, lies, and embarrassment. Through those 50 years I have had to act the male role. Coming out to my first wife ended in divorce. I am so scared and scarred that I fear coming out to my wife now. I appreciate what you are doing for your daughter. She will too. I wish I had parents who truly loved and wanted the best for me not just their image of who they want me to be. Your daughter is a beautiful perfect person that just needs some help for everyone else to see what she sees. Some may include surgery and that decision doesn’t need to be made now. It’s not easy. And there are no easy options. But I am sure you will find the right words and do the right things to make her life the happiest it can be. You got this momma bear.
As a young trans woman I'd say don't hold back at all, let them know how wrong they are because people like us don't get strong support all the time so the more confident you are in your support of your daughter the more she will probably grow in confidence her self😊, hope this helps(also tell your daughter I hope she is a very happy woman 😊)
Well I’d start with ‘never talk about my child’s genitals again, that is so far beyond inappropriate and completely unacceptable and you are now blocked’ because transphobia aside WTactualF. 

Honestly I don’t know if I’d bother with anything else.
I am a trans biologist keeping up with relevant literature in my free time and toying with the idea of putting together a literature review for publication. I have a few summaries of relevant papers that I’ve compiled from my cursory review. I’ve posted this elsewhere, but maybe it will be if use to you (though unfortunately I do not yet have links to the articles stored on my phone and I use Reddit exclusively through mobile, so looking further into these papers will require a bit of googling. My apologies— I’m working on it):

Suicide rates dropped from 29.3 percent to 5.1 percent when there was access to transition-related treatment. (De Cuypere, et al., 2006)

A meta-analysis of transgender people who transitioned medically demonstrated that the average reduction in suicidality went from 30% pre-treatment to 8% post-treatment, and that 78 percent of transgender people had improved psychological functioning after treatment. (Murad, et al., 2010)

“These findings suggest that clinical management including puberty suppression, enabled these formerly gender dysphoric adolescents to make important age appropriate developmental transitions, contributing to a satisfactory quality of life.” (de Vries, 2010)

86% of patients who accessed transition were assessed by clinicians at follow-up as stable or improved in global functioning. (Johansson, et al., 2010)

In a cross-sectional study of 141 transgender patients who accessed medical transition, suicide fell from 19 percent to zero percent in transgender men and from 24 percent to 6 percent in transgender women. (Kuiper, Cohen-Kettenis, 1988)

“Although more evidence would be welcome, adequately treated gender dysphoria is likely to be safer than the untreated condition, which is associated with an enhanced risk of depression and suicide. Reassuringly, few transsexuals regret undergoing treatment.” (Levy, et al., 2003)

“Second to social support, persons who endorsed having had some form of gender affirmative surgery were significantly more likely to present with lower symptoms of depression.” (Boza, et al., 2014)

“Studies show that there is less than 1% of regrets, and a little more than 1% of suicides among operated subjects. The empirical research does not confirm the opinion that suicide is strongly associated with surgical transformation.” (Michel, et al., 2002)
I agree with those that said don’t bother, just cut this person out. If you have to have the last word keep it short and don’t waste too much effort because nothing you say will change this person’s mind. Their comments are misogynistic in addition to being transphobic and they’re comfortable enough in their bigotry to try to tell you how to raise your daughter. I understand wanting to have the last word, I’m the same way, but a lot of the time it’s not worth engaging unfortunately.
Block them. Cut them out of your life . They aren't worth the anger. If that isn't an option then just stop replying.
""You are a horrible and toxic person. Goodbye. "" and then click block.
Also op you are a parent many of us would be so jealous to have. A lot of us had awful parents who forced us to not be out then
Tell him he’s mad fucking weird for talking about a 12 year olds genitals “servicing men”.
The correct term is dysphoria, not dysmorphia, but regarding that person, make an example of them and how their transphobic will not be tolerated towards your daughter. You are being the mother she needs, and obviously not doing anything wrong by letting het be herself.
That exactly why I uninstalled Facebook
The block button seems like a good response.  Wow! Awful.
Just msg you're going through a tunnel and the service is abysmal

Or something like transphobic says what? 

Gets them every time :) 

don't waste your time and energy on such a pathetic interaction go have a hot cup of cocoa nd snuggle with your daughter <3
Sadly you can't argue with a transphobe. They don't care 1 bit about anything. They're just full of hate.

Easiest thing is block and move on.
Saying your kid has a ""right"" to somthing, but then making it compulsory is all you need to know. Smh
She is not even a friend in real live. Your daughter is your daughter in real live. Don’t waste time writing to that person anymore. Don’t feed the troll. Write to your daughter and tell her you love her!
Oh, lots of responses come to mind:

* ""Do you know that my child's life and choices are none of your business?""
* ""Are you always this fixated on twelve year old children's genitals?""
* ""Perhaps you should spend some time thinking about the differences between rights and obligations.""
* ""Sorry, you must have me confused with someone else. I don't have a son.""
* ""Matt. 7:1-3""
* ""May God grant me the self-assured confidence of a mediocre, ill-informed white man""
* ""🖕""
Personally, I would reply with the following and then block them. No point in letting them continue to spew hatred to you. They seem unwilling to change.

""I'm sorry that your reality is so limited. I love my daughter for who they are, not the flesh that sits atop their bones. My daughter has a right to be a woman. A right to choose who she loves. A right to be happy as herself as you are with yourself. Seeing her happy fulfills me as a parent and these last 18 months I have watched proudly as she has taken steps few people are strong enough to take to fight for her own happiness. This is my daughter. This is her reality.

If I actually believed you would listen, I could tell you all the hundreds of ways I see this already healing my daughter. I could tell you the science that says she natural and justified. I could point to the millions of transitioned people whose only regret was not doing so earlier. My daughter is fortunate enough to realize and strong enough to say who she is. It is now my job as a parent and as a compassionate member of society to fight for her right to reach her maximum potential. This is my daughter. This is my reality.

I again am sorry that your reality is so limited. I wish you could see how beautiful the world becomes when you simply open your heart and mind. Unfortunately, the only thing you've proved to me is your unwillingness to grow. And so while my daughter blossoms from her seed, you will sit still among the dirt until you rot away, giving energy to the seeds that come after you. This is my daughter. This is our reality.""
""I still don't have a son.""

And block her.
Tell them their obsession with your child's genitals is alarming and they should seek therapy. Then block them.
Your daughter is 12 YEARS OLD, WHY IS AN ADULT EVEN THINKING ABOUT HER GENITALS? What the fuck
This person is not your friend and does not deserve to be in your life. Don't waste time on anger, hard as that may be.
First off my daughter hasn’t decided on surgery yet she is x yrs, so I’d kindly appreciate it if you would stop thinking about her genitalia plz,

I’m also a paranoid reclusive so I don’t often deal with ppl,

gl and much luv
""Cringe+ratio+L+transphobe+bigot""
There is absolutely nothing that you or anyone on this forum can say that will make any difference to them. There are piles and piles of evidence that prove you and your daughter right, and it will all go in one ear and out the other. Only thing I can suggest, is to cut this toxicity out of your life. It will only hurt you and your daughter. It's not worth the headache.
Who is this person?
They don’t sound safe. They are misinformed. 
Keep loving your daughter!!
You're being an amazing parent by supporting and protecting her. It makes me happy to see
Ask them why they're so interested in the genitals of a 12 year old
This guy is gross talking about your daughter's privates like that. Don't talk to this guy.
Logic and reason doesn't work in situations like this. They may change their mind sometime in the future, but nothing you say here will effect immediate change - even providing them with facts that show how this kind of thinking is detrimental to the actual lives of trans kids, or any facts at all, since they have an emotional, irrational, or ideological belief (you cannot reason someone out of a belief they were not reasoned into).

So, I tend to be direct about how gross and hateful their behavior is, and how little they are acting. It may sound a little harsh, but it let's them taste their own medicine with the slight difference of rejecting their behavior and not the essence of who they are as an individual. If it takes, then maybe they'll have their first hit of empathy that could possibly build over time.

With that said, my response would be something like:

""You are acting very hateful, and I don't want to be around people like you. Your comments make me feel icky. I hope you can find empathy for others who are different from you sometime in the future, and not rely on tearing down others to gain self importance. Until then, I no longer want you as even the smallest, most insignificant character in the narratives of my, or my daughter's, life narratives.""

I would then immediately block and ignore all attempts to communicate with this person unless they open with ""I'm sorry"".  Until they can grow as an individual, I would not let them have my attention to share their hate. But, that's just my approach.
I will forcefully fill that women’s home with pride flags until she cries rainbows
The reply is unfriend and block. I know it can feel cathartic to get the final word but… if my parents taught me anything it’s that “being the bigger person” means feeling like you lost a lot of arguments when simply walking away actually means winning.
Just block the fucker. No sense arguing with a bigot like that.
1 - please never talk to that person again & keep them as far from your daughter's life as possible, for her sake as much as for your own.

2 - as for a reply: 
""The fact you're more concerned with a 12 year old's genitals than with her happiness is disgusting. Reducing trans people to sexual organs is cruel, but the fact you're reducing a child to her genitals is just sickening. She is 12. My daughter is happy, and comfortable in her own skin, and frankly my love for her goes beyond expectations for the dynamic she'll take in a relationship when she is older. I'm more concerned with making sure she knows she is loved unconditionally. As far as we're concerned, her body is her own, and she can do whatever she likes to it in order to continue feeling comfortable in it. What that entails or doesn't entail is none of your business, nor is it anyone else's business unless she is consensually choosing to be involved with them. Which as a 12 year old, she is not choosing to do so yet. 
I valued your friendship, but if you're going to look at or talk to my daughter and only be able to think of her in a sexualised manner, then I don't want you in either of our lives. I strongly suggest you reevaluate how you see people, and if you base everyone's  worth based on your sexual expectations of them and believe it's your place to get involved to somehow ensure they meet those expectations, then I would suggest you reconsider that stance. Goodbye.""
Delete them and block them. It's as simple as that. They don't give you and your daughter the respect everyone deserves, you owe them absolute nothing for a response. 

Feeling angry over someone who is too closed minded to let others live their lives is someone you will never be able to convince to see different. Holding this anger over someone like this is not beneficial at all for you or your daughter.

Also OP, you're an amazing mother for being so loving and supportive. Stay strong and set the example for her, as she will inevitably face adversity in her life and won't ever rise above it if she stops and gets angry every time someone is being ignorant. ❤💙
no matter what this person says, stand your ground. there will be people out there who will say dumb things like that but don’t let them change your mind about your daughter
Personally I wouldn’t even grace them with a reply. Some people are blinded by their hatred, it’s often not worth getting through to them. I have to remind myself “Think: Would I actually WANT this person to be on my side, if they’re so set in their ways and easily believing?”
Cut this person out of your life like the cancer they are.

If you’d like ideas, you could start with the fact that this person is part of the reason the UK is increasingly seen as an international embarrassment for being known as TERF Island.
just say something along the lines of her insecurities are really showing and that a therapist could help with that and her bigotry
Do sleep on it before responding....then make it epic and done!  Hugz, you've got this.    
🥰🥰  Lilli~
Ask them 

why the fuck are they focused on your TWELVE YEAR OLD daughter’s Genitals. Like what are they? Some sorta pedo? 

‘Cause ew. She is 12! What is in her pants is non of their business. 🥴
I would just stop the conversation and not talk to them. You won’t change someones mind who doesn’t want their mind changed.
“It’s none of your business, leave me alone”
Get the (please excuse the language used here) hell away from them revoke them of the privilege of being around you and your life make them seem like they have entirely disappeared (what would be better would be to actually make them dissapear (don't tell anyone I said that) ) and get an entire council to make them away from you
""Why the fuck are you thinking about my twelve-year-old daughters genitals?""
Politely tell them to screw off and block the number. Not worth the headache. These type of people have no desire to learn or change their crap behavior.
You take every legal action possible to keep them away from your daughter and family.
I’d simply reply with a healthy helping of f*ck you 🖕
Block him or ask him why he’s so obsessed with your daughters genitals. That might shut him up a bit. Last message sounded creepy af
Response or not, your daughter is lucky to have you.
Use one of the most famous transphobic arguments against them: “Why would I speak about genitals with my 12 years old daughter?”
OP, you're not gonna convince this bigot. I promise.
This isn't something you reply to. This is someone you block and cut all contact with, and then name and shame on social media, emphasizing that this adult was messaging you about a 12 year old's genitals.

fwiw a neovagina isn't plastic, it's your own tissue. transphobes are fucking stupid part 302987
I personally wouldn’t dignify it with a response and just cut this person out completely. Block them and move on. If this is what they think you don’t need that negativity in your life or your daughters life.
I wouldn't even respond, just block them. Nothing you say will matter to them. And if you want to respond simply for your benefit, you'll have to write how you feel. I would end the response withbsomething about not wanting them in your life and then block them as soon as you responded, don't let them respond.
If it were me I'd just block them. It's hard to talk to people who have their head so far up their ass.
Don't reply. Simply block and ignore
Block them. Not worth your time.
Delete. Block.
They're a transphobic cunt, get them out of your life.
Link her to these videos.

https://youtu.be/nBbOw_K6K5Q

This trans YouTuber went undercover in the kinda of groups that your Facebook friends here likely is a part of. They uncover and debunk the violent propaganda that the group pushes and demonstrate how the rhetoric can lead to the deaths of trans youth. But most critically they expose that gender critical ideology is built on a cult logic. Actual. Explicit. Cult logic.
i think the correct thing to say is cry harder you piece of shit
""Keep talking about a twelve-year-old child's genitals, and I'll be having a word with the FBI, pedophile.""

Blunt and simple. When we're trans, we're no longer human, and all decency goes out the window to them.
You could either block them across all social media and forget they exist, or reply with ""Your opinion is worthless"" THEN block them across all social media and forget the exist. They're disgusting and you shouldn't bother with people like that. 

On the first whiff of bigotry, BLOCK.
Yeet that person out your life with the might of Zeus!
I am not you, so I’d have a very different response to this than I think you might.  I also don’t know your relationship with this person,  But here is how I would respond.

Phase 1: try to handle it alone

I’d tell that person to either stop pressing the issue or get out of my life.  I’d tell them they didn’t understand what they were talking about or what they were doing.  I would tell them this is my daughter, that I love and support her for who she is, and that I will protect her right to be herself with every fiber of my being.  If the person persisted I would tell them I couldn’t talk to them again until the respected my daughter’s gender, I would screen cap everything said I’m case this person started spreading lies later, and I would block them for my own sanity.

If this were sufficient to avoid this person and I didn’t care about their relationship, I’d avoid them and leave it there.  If they were in a position to harass me or my daughter, I’d go in ti phase 2.

Phase 2: group effort

If we had any mutual friends who I knew were supportive of my daughter,I’d go to them for help handling this.  I’d show them the screen caps if they didn’t understand.  This would serve two purposes.  Purpose one would be that maybe my friends, who are perhaps more emotionally detached, might be able to figure out a better solution.  If not though, this would also help protect me from being kicked out of the mutual friends circle I shared with the transphobe because other people would now know what is going on and have heard my side of it before it got misrepresented as me being unreasonable.  I would not ask any friends to cut off their association with the trabsphobe, but I would inform them that I didn’t feel comfortable being in the same space as them until they gendered my daughter correctly, and would not allow then around my daughter.

Phase 3: self defense if necessary

If this did not yield a stable solution and the other person escalated by attacking my interpersonal relationships, I would do everything in my power to cut them out of my life completely, and would in every situation possible ensure they did not have a position of power over my daughter and I.  This kind of conflict can easily turn into a fight over who gets to keep the friend group, hence the screen caps and the set up in the previous phase to make sure the friend group was prepared for this situation.  I would in all cases try to maintain the moral high ground by sticking to honest tactics.

But like, that’s me.  I am trans and cannot tolerate this stuff emotionally.  I’ve also been blackmailed over being trans by an anonymous person in my friends circle, so if I’m seeming a little excessive here that’s where I am coming from.  People like this can be dangerous, and need to be treated as dangerous.
delete facebook
In all honesty... I think the best response is to reply with a simple ""i disagree and would appreciate it if you never speak to me or my daughter again"" and then follow it up with just blocking them on all socials. They just want to pick a fight with you and it's best if you just do not give them the satisfaction.
Block and ignore. Not worth your time.
Block and move on, nothing else
Block that person and move on, you and your daughter don’t deserve that shit
I wouldn’t justify this with a response, this stranger is not entitled to information about your daughter’s transition journey. It’s clear this person does not support you or your daughter and the only thing they should get is a block
Same old same old. Doesn't aknowledge that the daughter made the choice to try to feel more comfortable in her body and completely ignores any scientific research on the topic. They don't deserve a place in your life, don't give it to them.
""it makes me sick that the only thing you want to talk to me about is my daughter's genatalia.  Which is, quite frankly, none of your business.""
Block, maybe cry a little. Works for me?
The obsession with your daughter’s genitals is pretty disturbing ngl. Sadly you probably won’t be changing the mind of someone like this, say whatever you want and then block them. Your daughter is lucky to have such a supportive parent willing to defend them, though!
You can tell based off the initial comment there is no changing this persons mind, block, forget about and move on. Don’t give them the time of day by justifying them with a reply.
I would say my daughter has the right to live her life, make her own choices, and fulfil her own destiny, as all women should be allowed in this life. I'm certainly not going to stop her. I never thought I'd have to tell my friend to stay in their lane when it came to my children and how they choose to live their lives. I'll save you the hassle of cutting me out - you're blocked. If you're wondering whether it's more important to me to make you comfortable with your outmoded ideas of gender or support my own child, let mama bear clear that up for you - I 1000% choose my daughter. Every. Time. You're a dinosaur and you and your opinions will be left, comfortably, in the past. You might convince yourself in your ignorance that you're helping me, you're not. Educate yourself, learn something and take a long hard look at how you just behaved today. Think about how you can do better and don't bother me or my family until you get some damn manners you rude cow.

And block the shit out of them.
Don't bother with a reply, nothing good will come out of it. You have a daughter you love and she loves you too, nothing else matters. Spend the energy somewhere happy 😊
You could point out that it's rather creepy and disgusting to be reducing an underage child to their genitals by stating a future she knows nothing about? Vaginas reconstructed or not weren't meant to ""satisfy male genitals."" A woman (trans or not) can be and is more than that. And the fact she even written it, let alone that part is gross and a little disturbing.
You were asking for things like replies, so you could say like: 
I will talk to my DAUGHTER and tell HER to never associate with the likes of you. You are transphobic and do not belong in my life. Do not contact me again and F off or something like that
Idk if they'd listen but I'd say something like ""I'd rather have a happy and healthy daughter that has autonomy over her own body than a dead ""son"" because we refused to let her be herself.
Tell parasocal Betty that Just because she's seen a few of your Facebook post doesn't mean she knows you personal what's good for you or your DAUGHTER. 


Tell her to focus on her own Boring life then trying to live in a fantasies of being apart of yours
I would say “the science says trans people are real, and conversion therapy has always proven to harm trans people. Why would I want to be my daughter’s own bully, and risk her dying because I had to listen to some uneducated jackass with their brain stuck in the Medieval Ages?”
Why are they talking about your daughters genitals and sex life? THATS fucking weird- would mention that in your reply and then block block block
[deleted]
Tell them to go fuck themselves, then block them.
You and your daughter don't need that energy, just move on and focus on being happy.
I'm mad envious of your daughter, I wish I had the courage to accept myself at that age ❤️ She's a warrior
I am blinded by anger just after reading this and can’t offer good advice because I’d lose my absolute FUCKING mind on this person but id just like to say, you’re an amazing parent, thank you for accepting your daughter for who she is and advocating for her.

This trash bag saying this shit should go play in some traffic.
Already the fact that this person is doing such a god awful scene in PUBLIC on Facebook is enough for you to throw them out of your life, what a shame.. btw you rock for taking care of your daughter that way !
Hoo boy that’s a lot to unpack. Actually, nah, not gonna bother.

“Anon, please, my daughter is better than you. Sure, your genitals may just be a dude’s fuckhole in your eyes but my daughter was raised to have some self-respect.”
She’s 12…why are the transphobes always so focused on genitals? Especially childrens? Honestly thag would be my response.

“Why are you so focused on my daughters genitals? She’s 12 you fucking pedo.”

Then block that person. Seriously not worth your time.
Your ""friend"" is sexualizing children. Gotta love them telling us we do the same. Your anger is justified.
That genuinely made me wanna vomit. That's it, I'm gonna walk into a pond, pretend to be a frog for a while, and then die. fuck humanity, embrace frog.
just don’t use social media lmfao it’s just that easy
Here's how I'd reply

""People are assigned a gender at birth based on their, one which determines thier name, pronouns, how they are expected to dress and look, and many other things. To think everyone would be happy and comfortable with the gender assigned to them is ridiculous and to force them to stay in an identity they dislike is cruel and tyrannical. It is none of your business how someone expresses themselves and how they identify themselves. I will be supportive of my daughter no matter what gender she wishes to be. My child's sex is not relevant to how they want to express their gender identity...a penis does not prevent her from being able to identify as a girl, wear dresses, and use she/her prounouns to identify herself as she desires. I hope someday you'll look beyond your discomfort and open up to seeing trans people as a natural result of assigning people into a gender identity at birth. This is goodbye, my daughter and I do not need a negative influence like you in our lives.
Tell your ""friend"" that just because they don't understand it it doesn't make it wrong.  Link them to the gender dysphoria Bible in case they'd like to educate themself.
Block, block, block. This sounds like a religious person (I grew up in it). From my experience they're often very critical of people changing their body to be more comfortable for themselves because of the assumption they were ""made"" and not a result of happenstance. The assumption that vaginoplasty will be used for a man's pleasure is stupid, there's so many other reasons (but pleasure is also valid sooooo...). Some people are asexual and still get the procedure because they have dysphoria (me in a few years). Also, the concept of ""sin"" is used to control and subdue people to prevent them leaving their religion. Sex is normal and exploration is healthy, so it doesn't even matter in the end. This person seems hella concerned with how your daughter presents, what her genitals are and it's none of their business. Tbh it's perverted as all fuck. They talk down to you with a complete lack of respect or intention to learn, which is going to be difficult if this person is a part of your life somehow. I'm sorry you have to deal with people like that. I live as myself, presenting as female because that's who I am. Anyone who has a problem with that has a problem with themselves; I'm not the problem because all I'm doing is existing, as myself.
Just block them. Nothing they're saying is true, you don't need that in your life.
Id for one report them to facebook for harrasment, tell them to go fuck themslves (or some variation of it) and block them
Just block them? Don’t waste your time with idiots
Know...personally I'd reply with something along the lines of look I appreciate you trying to look out for us (I'm aware they aren't but that's likely how they see it) but in the end she's my kid not your so I will continue to raise her and support her if you don't like it that's your own damn problem not hers
""no, I must do this...."" What they mean is no, I must be a c-unit, when in reality they should step back and mind their own fucking business.

This is what I would write:

 What's in my daughters pants is none of your business. Are you me? What gives you the notion, the audacity to even fucking think that you can comprehend saying this to us? To think you can tell me how to parent my own child. My child knows what's best for her. And as a DECENT parent I support her in her decisions. Unlike you showing me you are not supportive in this (friendship?).
The wise thing would be block without a word.

But knowing myself I’d probably act angrily-
This is absolutely revolting especially since she is talking about a fucking child, Please please block this person and worn all of your relatives with kids to stay the hell away from this woman. 🤮
I don't know if I would have a reply other then to say what a fucking creep.
They're literally sexualizing a 12 year old 🤢🤢🤢
What genitals my daughter has is her business and hers alone, this does not involve you. My daughter only owes it to herself to be who she is and not who society or others say she is. This is who she is, if she wants to change or not change that’s for her to decide. My job as her parent is to make sure she’s happy, prepared for the world and to help her explore and find herself.

Your view on what “purpose” a vagina is for is very telling for how you think of women, goodbye I will most likely not be talking with you again.

That would probably be my response
Call them a cunt and tell them to stop talking about a child’s genitals
Pretty sexiest to assume the only use for there vagina would be ""to pleasure men"". So if a women is infertilie is her's just as useless to them? What of there a lesbian and don't want to be with a man, is that also going to be a problem for them? This is the problem with people like this, even if there remarks don't seem that bad at first (not really in this case but just in general) if you ever actually start to think into it you realize they either had to blatantly ignore so many things or have to have a ton more really bigoted and bat shit crazy ideals. Report that person, block them cause they don't even deserve a response, then go hug your daughter and tell them how much you love and support them.
I doubt either of these will be helpful because I'm too furious to give you any sort of thoughtful ""murdered by words"" type of reply.  I've spent the last 22 years being relentlessly pestered by relatives about ""when \[I'm\] having babies and making them a \[grandparent/aunt/uncle/etc\]"", am currently waiting for a doctor's appointment to find out whether or not I was *born* sterile, and so I have to apologize to you that I've triggered super hard at the ""A child is the parent's property, and exists for no reason than to breed grandchildren"" mentality on display here.

Here's the best responses my rage-addled mind can come up with:

""My ***daughter's*** quality of life is not and will never be second to your desire to see her have children.  My child is her own person, not property or livestock...I have no idea why *you're* so invested in *my* daughter reproducing, not to mention that only truly sick fucks spend that much time thinking about a *12-year-old child's* genitals"".

Either that, or

""My daughter is leaving masculinity behind, and is still a bigger man than you'll ever be.""
You should know that your daughter is going to deal with people like this nearly every day of her life. This is one idiot in a sea of millions. This one's just a keyboard warrior. We have to deal with way worse than this guy all the time.
Well, unless this is someone with some kind of power over you, ""You are a bigot with no knowledge. Go talk to trans people and genuinely listen and try to learn. I may let you get back in contact with me if I see that you have educated yourself."" followed by unfriending them and never talking to them again is a valid response.

You are welcome to try to educate them, but trying to educate them is unlikely to work and is likely to upset you and waste your time. They are clearly bigoted and unwilling to really come to the table and talk with trans people or even our allies. This person seems like they know nothing about being trans OR about biology but they decided they are an expert and likely won't listen to evidence.

Do not let this person anywhere near your child if possible. They are not a safe person.
OMG I WISH I HAD A MOM LIKE U💕
the fact that they’re even bringing up your child’s genitalia in a sexual manner is an extremely big red flag to never associate with that person again. maybe a restraining order too.
I think you said it best when you said ""I don't have any sons.""
They don't deserve any further of your time.
Facebook usually means braindead (at least here in Europe and Spain); a report and block are the right choice for these kinds of people. 

Don't waste your time
Hmmm okay so don't befriend that person, doesn't seem like they'd be a good friend or a good influence on your daughter's life. In addition that person isn't very well informed and clearly has never done any actual research on the matter and is literally spouting nonsense and ""propaganda"" like a crazy person.a friend of mine went through something similar to this with her mum and one of her mum's ""friends"", the friend started getting really aggressive towards her daughter after a while and they had to get the police involved and after they arrested her mum's ""friend"" (who was a priest) they found a bunch of Nazi flags and KKK robes and all sorts of messed up tuff in his house so just be careful because this person could be really harmful towards you and your family.
I'm so grossed out at how they're talking about a child's genitals. Absolutely disgusting. Also the way they're talking about how a vagina will only be for a man's pleasure like that would have any substantial impact on that future decision or assuming your child would be straight? (Or really all trans women according to their comment) truly concerning.
If you haven’t answered, you could simply state something like this “my DAUGHTER has a right to be who SHE is and YOU have no say in what SHE can and can not do, my daughter is more comfortable being my daughter then my son, and if you cannot accept that then this is our final exchange of messages” then block them, that’s how’d I’d go about that
I don't know about your daughter, but with my son it was all about mental health. Anxiety, depression, migraine, even some OCD disappeared when she came out and transitioned. If you have had anything like that with your daughter, perhaps ask about whether this person suggests returning to that crippling level of mental health?!
I'd ghost their ass. Your daughter and you have a bond for life, this jerk is just trying to force their views with no knowledge or sensitivity to the impact just because they think they have the right. Get support of people who actually give a shit about your and your daughter, even if that includes getting advice from a gender affirmation counsellor to bounce ideas off. This jerk is part of the reason that trans kids go through so much shit. He is part of the problem.
You shouldn't have to justify your daughter's existence to someone who doesn't love them.

This person won't see past this. Most transphobes can't see past it until someone they love comes out as trans and many don't grow or change when that even happens; many people break ties with them just for that.

As much as protecting your daughter is important, trying to fight someone who wouldn't ever understand anyways is just gonna make it worse on everybody.

Theres good articles out there for evidence on way this is natural and just as normal as any idealistic transphobic universe, but they won't listen.

You could say its not this person's choice whether or not your daughter becomes what they want your daughter to. They don't control your daughters life. And that you support your daughter.


If you keep fighting with this bitch of a human, it'll show. Keep that freak away from you, away from your daughter, make sure that person can't find any information to find your family because at this point do you know this person enough to feel they won't do anything stupid? Can you trust that person wont try something harmful?

I am begging you to block them. Make sure you keep no contact. Keep your child safe. Make sure you can stay safe so that you can continue supporting and protecting your child.

If you want to reply all you can do now is remind them what rights they actually have over your child. None. But after that BLOCK THEM.
Yeah... I may not be the best to give a reply either. Anything I am coming up with is increasingly violent and probably wouldn't help much.
My attempt at a reply, speaking strictly as a parent: 

*ahem*

""Wow, so many false assumptions there I wouldn't know where to start. Good thing it's not my job to educate you. Move along.

Oh, and 'plastic vagina' would be a great name for a rock band. Thanks for that.""
Honestly I would unfriend this person and keep a Witch out for the person and not hesitate calling the police
unfortunately, as someone who has had SO MUCH patience with transphobes in the past, and truly believes in positive change through individual/community connection etc etc......... just block this piece of trash. not gonna listen to a word of what you say bc they have their own shit to work through, and it's only gonna dig em deeper into their own views. it makes me sad to realize that sometimes the only way people can either change or stop negatively affecting you is to just not engage.
I would honestly just block them, don't even bother responding. You are not going to be able to get anything from this, and the fact that this person is talking about your 12-year-old daughter's body like that is extremely uncomfortable and concerning, I wouldn't try to reason with them, just block and forget about them.
If I were you I would simply block and move on. This person has forfeited the luxury of being in your life by disrespecting you and your daughter (who I take it he hasn’t even met? side note: it’s extremely creepy and weird for him to be talking about the genitals of a child he hasn’t even met!)

You’re better than him. You don’t owe him an explanation. If you’re going to say anything, imo it doesn’t need to be anything more than “bye!”
You will never explain the reality to a transphobe. I would just say something like „Sadly your lack of information, all the misinformation and your own emotions lead me to draw a line. Stop contacting me, this leads nowhere“
I would say ""Fuck you."" But maybe that's too harsh.
Yeah…I don’t think you need to respond. Honestly, I think you should block this person on social media, and your life.
I'm mtf, 17yo, my mom is very supportive and I would fully expect her to cut this person out of her life on the spot if that ever happened to us, it's the highest level of disrespect that someone can have and it's just not something you want to keep around
Tell her that your kid doesn't exist for others
Don't worry about this more than you need. It's not in your power to change that person's ideas, just keep your daughter and yourself safe. If you engage too much, it's only going to make them stronger and you weaker. Think happier thoughts, be healthy, imagine saying a juicy ""fuck you"" to their face and move on
Just block the creep, tbh. You don't need someone who is that obsessed with your 12 year old child's genitals in your life. I don't think anything you say will change their mind, and they're not worth the effort of trying. Especially if they're not even someone you know irl and you just sometimes bump into eachother online
If you really want to argue with this person you could start at the biological point:
In biology are several ways to describe the sex of a person (hormones, chromosomes, body parts, etc.). Each one of these characteristics appears on a spectrum e.g. a micropenis is very close to a clitoromegaly. This variety brings a problem: How should you determine when someone is a women or a men? Well the answer from a biological point of view is that we simply can’t exactly determine this. Now you may be thinking that we are closer to intersexuality rather than the TG-topic. Well not really!Because we are not able to tell wether phenomena such as body dysphoria have a neurobiological reason. It could be that our gender identity is determined in our brainchemistry. As we can’t tell for sure now we just have to take the feelings of the people who suffer from body dysphoria serious we have to help them to like their body. We know from so many pointless attempts that this is not possible with a C0nvers10ntherapy but very well achievable with surgery, hrt and most importantly FUCKING ACCEPTANCE!!! This is by far the most important part people who describe transpeople as mentally ill are biologically spoken idiots who don’t know their stuff and the mental damage they cause with their words. Even though the mental health of queer people isn’t the best, this mostly comes from poor acceptance and social or cultural pressure.
Why the fuck does anyone care about some other persons kids opinions on their genitalia. Jesus christ. Fucking insane behavior.
I obviously don't know how important this person is to you, but I would just tell them to go fuck themselves and block/report. They're going waaaaaaaay over the line of what's acceptable in any circumstance.
""plastic vagina""

I love it when transphobes don't even know what they're fighting. Makes it all the more easier to tear them apart.
Someone posted a jon Oliver quote earlier that said something to the effect of ""some transgender people will medically transition, some will get surgery, and some won't. And medically speaking, it's non of your fucking business."" 

This person has decided to cross a boundary you set, saying not to go into this topic. Their opinion is not wanted, and yet they gave it anyway. I'd say report their comment(s), for as much good it'll do, and then block them. 

You can tell them it's not their business, especially so given they're talking about a literal child at this point, but don't feel like you owe them an explanation either, especially for someone who (I hope) isn't even aware that this is happening, and who is simply trying to be happy. 

I don't know if you actually know this person or if they're more of a friend of a friend kind of thing, but definitely do not allow them to take any more of your time or energy with their twisted obsession (seriously, NOBODY should be *that* interested in a child's genitals... To me at least, it seemed like there was a bit too much focus there, maybe I'm reading things that aren't there, idk)

It might also be good to talk to your daughter if you think she's mentally mature enough to handle the topic, about people like this, and help practice shutting them down, blocking them, escaping or finding help, and how to handle the stress and such from dealing with them. As terrible as it is that it's still something we have to deal with, it would be better to have her aware of some ways to manage if she does end up encountering them, online and especially in person. 

You don't have to show her these comments, since that could definitely be a bit too much, but at least going over how to report and block people, learning when to stop ""debating"" these people, and so on would definitely be a good start. 

I'm so, so sorry you have to deal with this... But if it helps at all, it's wonderful you care enough to ask for help with it, and I hope it isn't too much to say that we're all in support of you and her.
Time to disingage with that person, that still sticks though!
That doesn't even deserve a reply. Just delete their comments, block them, and move on with your life. You can't fix stupid, and that person  is just above and beyond moronic.
Things to do besides take the time to educate an asshole who won’t listen: sign petitions in the states that are bringing transphobic legislation, write to politicians in your area to influence them to do the right thing when voting on trans legislation. Join a phone bank to bring awareness to citizens about what their politicians are doing to innocent trans kids. Buy some trans affirming childrens books and donate them to a local teacher or library. Join the group Free Mom Hugs and take part in their activism. Find an org that supports trans kids and make a post on your social media letting your other internet followers know about that amazing org. Join a regional trans parents support group. This is the beginning of a lot of fights that you will have to fight to help your daughter, don’t waste your resources on internet bigots.
BLOCK
People that imagine there's one transgender surgery obviously have no idea what it's actually like to be transgender. No surgery is leaving people with plastic vaginas either, that person has no idea about what they're talking about. It's a bit of a dunning-kruger situation because they don't know how little they know. On top of that they're transphobic so it's really frustrating.

That person is saying talk to your son, so you can respond that you did talk to your daughter and told her you'll always love her and protect her from ignorant transphobes like that person.

Btw I know this is unrelated but there is a difference between dysmorphia and dysphoria as you mentioned dysmorphia in the title. Trans people usually have dysphoria though some could also have dysmorphia in the same way as cis people.
your daughter is TWELVE? it's so creepy how transphobes like this are so hyper focused on a twelve year old's genitals. a 12 year old's sex life. the idea of who that 12 year old might have sex with in the future. what the fuck? they're not gonna be her partner, so that's not their fucking business
Say that their opinion doesnt count since its your child, say ""fuck you"" and block them. :)
I've read that the Y chromosome is pretty much empty besides like eye/hair color and some cosmetic stuff. The only real thing it does is trigger production of testosterone. Everyone has the genes for the expression of male or female features. This person is just spouting outdated horse shit.. tell him to go suck a bag of horse cocks and then block the cunt. That's what I do to these people. The never change your mind and nothing you say will do anything
SMH what is wrong with people
""Plastic vagina""

^^what
Yeah I think police should know that some fucking creep is interested in your kids genitals.
Just block
Your child has a right to be whoever she wants to be, make it clear she's not being pushed either way, and she's happy. I don't think any more needs to be said.  
All the bigotry aside, 'plastic vagina' is straight up wrong.
“I hope that you can find enough peace in your life that you no longer feel the need to attack my 12 YO daughter over who she is. Take care and don’t communicate with us again” or simply, “I would talk to my son… if I had one”
Cis parents of a trans child, You are not responsible for others opinions, or  thoughts. You are not responsible for trying to make them understand, thats entirely on them. They have clearly decided they dont want to know, and wish to be hurtful. Thats their choice.  
Your only choice is to cut that kind of rubbish out of your life, without comment or notice or chances.  


As i told my father (who was transphobic), you dont need to understand it, how it works, or even agree with it, you just need to use the right pronounds and name, and not talk about it otherwise
tell them to shut the hell up with their bigotry and cut them out of your life
Honestly, I would delete any public post that attracts such comments.  You aren’t going to win a debate with trolls, and it’s not worth sacrificing you or your daughter’s mental health, safety, or privacy.
This person’s view of reality is so distorted that I have no idea how I would respond, but I will say that it’s always so weird to see the obsession that transphobes have with trans children’s genitals, it creeps me out every damn time.
Tell ‘em to fuck off and mind their own damn business.
Possibly more politely than that though.
Honestly? Here’s what you should say. Word for word, because people like this are scum.

“Get Lost, (name). It’s none of your business what they do to their body. If you aren’t going to be happy, stay out of their life.”
That’s a friend? Even if we look past the transphobia there is also some sexism in that text by saying that a vagina is useless unless it is pleasing a man
What right do they have to dictate you how to treat your daughter? Simply say that they have no business pushing their abusive ideologies onto you and your family, block the bitch and never interact with them even outside of internet. Don’t try to “re-educate” or even reply. Don’t waste your time on such POS.
'I know that my daughter has the right to be a man if SHE so chooses. It's not up to you to decide that for her. Much like you have the right to decide to not be a cunt.'
Cut that douche out of your life. They’re a transphobic (and probably also homophobic, judging by that reaction) piece of sh\*t. They’re not a real friend, and will probably just continue to harass your daughter if you don’t cut them out
I'm a cis male and do not in any way want to speak for anyone, but people like this one who purposefully use the wrong gendered pronouns when talking about trans people very much annoy me, so this is the solution that I have come up with.  
  
I figured that since they apparently seem to think that it isn't a big deal to call people by whatever pronouns they like, then they should have no problem with me picking pronouns to use when referring to them! So the pronoun that I am choosing to call them is the descriptive pronoun 'asshole'.   
  
I'm sure that none of the assholes out there have a problem with the pronoun that I have choosen to call them by. After all, if the asshole had a problem with their new pronoun, it would be somewhat hypocritical of that asshole. Of course, if they ask me to not call them that, I will have to tell them that they are obviously an asshole, and that I will not participate in their delusion that they are anything but an asshole.   
  
I think that it is important that I also remind the asshole that being an asshole is a choice, and that I will gladly use the pronouns that they like, just as soon as they stop being an asshole.   
  
I like this idea, but I would love to hear any thoughts about my approach when confronted with assholes. And PLEASE, if you believe that me calling them assholes in this manner is something that could possibly make anyone's life harder than it needs to be, then please tell me so that I can adjust my approach when dealing with these assholes. After all, my goal is to be the best ally I can be, and not just another asshole.
Just tell them to fuck off and stay away from your daughter.

Then cut them off completely.

Best thing to do.
Only necessary thoughts in response to this are ""You're not offering any enlightening help. You're just being ignorant and condescending. Please mind your own business because I have no need of help from you regarding this. Nothing you say will change the fact that I have no sons and a very happy daughter. Please don't try to contact me on this matter again.""

P.S. I am absolutely livid at this person and would scold them the fuck OUT if this was in person. Neither your daughter nor you deserve this. Please block this person if possible, they deserve 12 cavities.
The last word is theirs. Say nothing. Block and delete. Move forward. Don’t engage. Keep progressing. X
If it was me and that was my mum id be hurt my mum would continue to talk to someone who said that about me probably best to say notting but block
Shitty hieroglyphics person doesn't have a say over your daughter, knowing you for a long times makes no difference as they fundamentally are not trying to help her whatsoever.

Personally id just ignore them unkess they make or have made a habbit of it, as then its a core issue that can't be worked around.
“I am uncomfortable with you talking about my child’s genitals, especially in a sexual nature. (Referring to talking about how her purpose will just be to satisfy a man’s genitals.) I’m not sure why you are obsessed with her genitals, but I am ceasing all contact with you to protect her from a possible sexual predator.”

Maybe not actually the best choice of words, but the best possible action.
Tbh what I'd do in this situation is, depending on how well you know this person, buy a jar of pickles. Then, open it, and bury it in your backyard for 8 years. Then, dig said pickle jar up, as it is now infested with dirt and bugs. Then make this person a sandwich, with said pickles in the jar.

Oh, or kick them in the appropriate genitals. Either or.
It sounds tough, but some people will never understand trans people. They’ve been raised being told it’s not ok. They’ve had no experience with trans people, and they’re not willing to learn. A lot of my friends were like this. Half of them were open to changing their mindset, and the other half weren’t. The half that weren’t open to changing their mindset, I had to cut off. It’s really tough, but in the long run, I’m much happier to be surrounded by people who accept me, and don’t treat me like I’m gross or other. 

Tell them that your child is MORE than genitalia. Being referred to as a boy causes her distress because she is transgender. She has a girl brain, and is a girl. Trying to tell people that don’t understand is difficult, and often times you have to simplify it greatly for them to understand.

Tell them that if they aren’t open to accepting your daughter, then you don’t think you can be friends with them.
Unfriend and block. If they can’t support your daughter, they can’t support you. There is no changing their mind and all they think they’re doing is telling you how “it really is” when that isn’t how it really is. You have a daughter that will grow up to be a beautiful wife (if she so decides), a beautiful mother (if she so decides), a successful woman in all she does, and so happy with herself and her supportive mom. Anyone that isn’t supportive is just another person that does not deserve to be in your or your daughters life. You do not have to respond or try to educate her either. You can, if you want, but it’s not your place (meaning you aren’t obligated to). You can even give a last message before you unfriend her and block her, if you want. This woman sounds ignorant though, and is unwilling to change that. You aren’t responsible for trying to change it.
Block them. This is a wildly inappropriate way to speak about anyone, but ESPECIALLY A CHILD. They should not be thinking about your daughter’s genitals.
If you respond, you're just making it seem like their backwards-ass opinion matters enough to warrant thinking about. The burden of their education is on themselves, not you. Block them and move on.

Also, I am super sorry to hear that you're going through this. You seem like an amazing parent and one that I wish I had had growing up. You actually listen to and understand your child, and you educated yourself where you had to. Thank you for being such a wonderful role model for other parents. ❤
There is not even the pretense of engaging you in good faith here. I wouldn't justify this with a response.
Tell them to fuck off. In More ""polite terms"", your daughters genitals are none of their business. They can only see someone as a machine for making children.
What the fuck is wrong with that disgusting inhuman abomination, i have never seen such a reprehensible pile of sewage and i live in a country that is run by them, don't respond cut all ties block them report them whatever you want but don't feed into them
Why do you need to answer to a so called “Friend”? She’s your daughter, defend her and leave your so called “friend” behind. You’re her parent you know what’s best for her and you get to decide who will be a part of your lives.
Why do they only think about sex?
The persons not a friend and you don’t need to talk to your child at all about this if she opts for the op or not as for opting for grand children that’s your daughters opinion on the matter if they give that to you also it’s going to be their kid first and your grand child second so all the decision is upto her. Period. 

You need to tell him to mind his own god damn business
Annnnnnnd blocked.   For real, why are they so concerned for your 12 yo's genitals?  They clearly know next to nothing about how transition works, especially for youth, and they clearly know nothing about being trans.  

Side note, why are transphobes so obsessed with women have to be able to give birth?  It's a dumb position even if trans folk didn't exist.
Tell him to fuck off, he's just a jerk
Not worth a reply or any engagement.
Block and report, simple
""Only to satisfy another mans genitals""??? 
MFer have you heard of self worth??????
Or like even if we go down the sex route, LESBIANS?!?!?!

This person says they want to befriend you but I straight up wouldn't trust them around your daughter. They'd do irreparable damage to her mental wellness.
Cut em out, i say.
I would be forced to tell her his “v” is no more different than a cis female who elects not to have children. That is the most ignorant thing I’ve read. I’d tell friend to focus on their own life because you’ve learned people that concerned with controlling and judging others’ usually has lots in their own that needs to be worked on.

Edit:  I would block the crap out of that person after I said what I said. No need in reading more hatefulness from her.
they think they're educated missionaries, don't help your kid and she will attempt suicide or will have heightened tendencies and thoughts, those people don't care about your children, they care about conditioning them to meet their criteria, and don't let them do that.

i was denied many things as a trans kid and it made me just more and more upset or disgusted with myself, not all trans people go on hormones, not all of them are going to get bottom surgery, and definitely not all trans people have bottom surgery for pleasing others, their genitals can bring even worse dysphoria in some cases and it can cause serious anxiety, depression and even bring them to suicide. children know their gender identity very young and denying her help will only make her sad and resent you. 

dont listen to the bitch she's so behind and so uneducated, help your kid as much as possible, i recommend discussing hormones in the next months, since starting them later can be a pain, and talk about surgeries years ahead. that person doesn't care about befriending you if they're so open of the prejudice and hate towards your child, i wouldn't waste my time with them. if you care about your child's well-being and safety block them. 

these things were vital to me but might not be for her

• name change 
• gender affirmimg clothes
•  hormones
Don't give those people the time of day. When my mother found out I was trans she responded by putting a knife to my throat. Some people are just going to be miserable and make it the world's job to be miserable too. It makes my heart ache you care so much for your girl to keep her safe and happy, sadly you can't do everything. My advice: don't waste time on people who know nothing about you and aren't worth it. There's litterly too many to even count or fathom trying to have a civil conversation with. Many whom will be unwilling so why bother? You don't need to justify your existence to legitimate human cesspools of pseudo ""morality"" and self loathing they unleashed onto others. You'll learn in time that they are sad lonely people and it's best to let them be sad and lonely while you spend your time being out and happy. I hope this helped a little even if it's not what you're entirely looking for.
My replay would be on the lines of,
""This is MY daughter and you have no say in this matter, her 'duty' is to live a fun life until she's 18 and learn everything she can in school not be a baby making machine to make you and your paper thin personality happy""
That’s fucked up on so many levels. I’d just say something like “this isn’t your business, this is her life, don’t force your bigoted views on others, now fuck off”
Do not reply. These people feed off of the idea that they're correct and getting under your skin. Your best way to deal with this transphobic idiot, is to just not. Do not waste your energy on this person. Do not let this person make you upset. 

If you must say anything. 

Ask them how often they talk about children's genitals. Ask them why your child's genitals are so important to them. Ask them if they talk about their own children's genitals. Usually if you start pointing out their weird obsession with children's genitals they will stop. 

But honestly if you could just block them and not say anything to that transphobic piece of trash. That would be best.
It's super creepy that a nother adult 
Is so hung up on you child's genitals
Dear X: My son decided ""he"" wasn't happy with a male body and being treated as a man, so he tried becoming a woman instead. Now, SHE is happier than ever, and I can see the difference in her smile.

How is a loving parent supposed to say no to that?

Anything else is irrelevant, and her personal decisions are none of your fucking business.

Sincerely, ________.
“they have a right to be a man”
as if rights HAVE to be used at all times?
From my point of view, I think that you should tell them “She is my daughter, and no matter what choice she takes, as long as she’s happy with it then i’ll be supporting her in every moment that can make a difference between her enjoying her life or being unhappy and possibly hating her life. If she doesn’t wants her genitals then i’ll be with her so she can have her reassignment, if she sees no problems with it, yet keeps wishing to be seen as my daughter then that’s the way it will be, because that’s what she deserves. Love, support and respect. And trying to convince her to not be who she truly would be like telling her that I don’t love her the way she is” I hope i haven’t said anything offensive against you or your daughter. And, lemme tell you, that you truly are a great parent, I hope that you and your daughter don’t get any complications on her fulfilling her dream, which, with the support of someone as amazing as you, will surely get to <3
Yeah that's insulting to say the least.
Just let it be. This person doesn't have a say on the way you raise your child neither has an opinion about it. Punching a brick wall will hurt yourself more than anything else. I feel really sorry for you having to pass through this kind of stuff. Just so you know, you're a wonderful person and your daughter is really, really lucky for having you.
What's their deal with trans people and your daughter in particular?
Tell her to find something better to do with her pathetic, short life than obsessing over stranger's children's genitalia over the internet
Do not reply this person. And wtf is that befriend in real life shit? Do you not know this person???? 

Ew
someone will always have a problem with you no matter who you are or what you do, so just take no notice of them and get rid of them out your life
Tell them if they don't want to support your daughter, whom they have NO right to dictate, they can take a fuckin hike :)
Arguing with these people is such a waste of time.  Apparently, this is some online-only connexion, you don’t even really know this person and they don’t deserve a response.  I often block people and accounts sans hangup. Fuck these assholes.  Block and move on.
""Okay I talked with my daughter and we agreed you should go fuck yourself"" then block. 

These people don't know what they're talking about, and you shouldn't waste brainpower trying to argue with them.
Fuck that guy
Jesus Christ this person should never be allowed women or children. What the fuck
Delete and block. Unfortunately, this won’t be the last time something like this happens and as much as we’d like to think we can educate others, all of these exachanges add up and end up harming you in the end. In my opinion 🙂
I would ask you to consider what you expect to get out of confronting this person and continuing to interact in general. Do you think you can convince this person to change their mind? Do you *need* to change their mind for some reason? Certainly your daughter's legal rights don't hinge on this, and from what I've read it seems this person isn't important or even known to your daughter really.

But even if you think there's some value to convincing them, they aren't going to be if they aren't willing to listen with at least a partially open mind. If it were me, nothing I'm reading here screams to me that they're even interested in hearing alternative perspectives, and it's a lost cause. At least for now.

Obviously we do want to help convince people that yes, trans people are valid and should be treated as our true selves. Maybe someday they'll reconsider and change their mind. But you can't make that happen. None of us can either, and trying to persuade them is going to be futile at best and potentially harmful at worst.

It's where the quip, ""it's not my job to educate you"" comes from. That education needs to happen, but a hostile and unwilling student does not make for a proper opportunity. For your own sanity and your daughter's safety, my recommendation would be that if you're able to cut them out, do so.
Someone is going to fucking perish today
tell her to 1. worry about her own genitals, 2. stop talking about your child's genitals, 3. who your child is is not up for debate, and 4. unfriend you if she can't stop being a creep
Jeez, this ""~~friend~~"" needs some sort of education..
I recommend to just cut this person out of your life period what they are doing is damaging to not only your mental health but your daughters if she ever caught wind of this later on in life so my recommendation don’t reply just block them and move on
“I must”

They mustn’t. Just an overall bad person who thinks they’re on some kind of holy crusade and that you owe them for their “insight”.
Oh they will be getting blocked. I just want the final word on this matter before I do so. I don't wanna block them without saying something in her defence because this person will think that that is me admitting that they are right. I'm just so fucking angry that I can't put in to words what I want to say. I keep typing and deleting.
Luckily, my daughter doesn't know this person and I would never subject her to their obviously wrong opinion. I will be blocking them too once I've had my say. I'm just absolutely livid rn and can't get my thoughts on order. I'm not blocking them til I've explained how and why they are wrong though. I may have to sleep on it.
Agreed, OP calls her a friend but my advice would be to never speak to her again.
Imagine talking about operations and its purpose for apprently ""just serving another man's pleasure"" in regards to a 12 year old. This is just disgusting. Delete him as a friend, and delete his comments before  your daugther sees it.
My step brother is semi-famous and he knew he was a boy at three years old! He is now 33 and living his best life as the man he truly is. He has books published in America and England about his feelings of being stuck in the wrong body in school. His books are actually being distributed to schools. 
You have just given me a great idea of sending my ""friend"" the link to my step brothers book. That really explains everything!
So quite honestly, trying to explain yourself to them is a waste of time. They're not going to be swayed by pretty much anything you say, and it's just going to be a drain on your time and energy. You are going to encounter people like this over and over again for years to come. In this instance you can simply say, ""I'll actually be going with the advice of experts on this, have a nice life."" and block them. Protect yourself and your daughter by not extending your energy to people with bad intentions. You don't owe them an explanation, a justification, or literally any information about this at all. They can go be mad somewhere else.
I’m not sure how great I am with words but here are some of my thoughts about how I feel being a trans woman and how it feels to have a relatively supportive mother ☺️

So I only realised recently that i was a trans woman about 7 months ago, but since then i’ve had one thing become extremely obvious, and that was how my life before was super miserable and sad and i can tell now that that was largely due to all of these repressed feelings. For me I had horrible experiences all throughout my teens because of how unhappy i was with myself i think. Once i realised i was trans i actually started to feel good sometimes and even though things are hard i am so much happier now and i can’t imagine life if i hadnt realised. It wasnt a choice for me at all, the only way for me to honestly live my life was for me to begin transitioning. And one of the things keeping me going is how much support i have. My mother has been very supportive and she’s definitely not perfect but i don’t expect that at all. I have incredible friends and a girlfriend too! I think that even with all of the support from my friends, if my mother didnt support me i would be a lot more unhappy. But she supports me and she’s teaching me new things and i know i couldnt do this without all of the people i love! For context im 19 so im probably older than your daughter but i hope this helps a bit! I’m really sorry you have to deal with things like that, but i hope that you’re able to have a nice day even still! ☺️
Unfortunately not, some people are really bigoted and far too interested in how others live, and making sure they fit the very box prescribed to them.

I love that you support your daughter, I'm sure it means the world to her even if she doesn't have words to describe her feelings. Learning how to exist in this world can be really hard, especially as a trans person. My parents and extended family have been abusive and unsupportive and it hurts because it forces me to recognise their values are harmful to others, despite having been looked after relatively well, inbetween the abuse (stockholm?). Seeing parents supporting their trans children makes me really happy, because I know those children have one less source of trauma as well as support in the things they do experience.

For me, I felt uncomfortable with my genitals and gender as early as 2. I went to kindergarten in girls' clothes once because it felt more aligned with myself but the way my family and kindergarten made me teel embarrassed taught me early about transphobia or at least the concept of controlling people with no reason. I've always conducted myself more femininely than my peers in school, and I never understood why until I realised other people don't feel like they're in the wrong body. Knowing I have the opportunity because of medical science to change the parts of myself that give me intense dysphoria is incredibly encouraging because it makes me feel like I have the opportunity to change the things about myself I have been uncomfortable with for pretty much my entire life. Why would you deny someone of that? Some people don't feel the need for surgery or other procedures, others do. It's nobody's decision but the one with the body.
I can’t say to what it means to be supported from a young age but I can speak to what it felt like to have the wrong body and not be supported.

 This was back in like 2007 or so. I felt like a freak, a monster, broken… society told me that I was a boy, boys don’t want cute things, boys don’t want to be a girl or treated like one, boys don’t get to cry, boys don’t get to show emotions, boys don’t get help. If you don’t fit in as a boy your a freak, the but of jokes, broken, opening yourself up to bullying, so why would you bring on all that pain. Surely it’s easier to live with hating yourself for who you are and not all of your friends, family and society hating you, surely all of them combined are stronger than you and they will just force you back down so why even try, just sit back and hate yourself, it’s easier. 

The strongest thing I felt was that I was broken, a freak, a monster because I was different, different from what society said I had to be and I hated feeling like that. So I hated having these feelings of wanting to be myself, so I hated myself. To have been supported and told it was ok if I had those feelings that other people have them too and it’s ok… I can’t even imagine how much happier I would of been, it brings me to tears remembering it but it makes me want to speak out and show others that it’s ok. I don’t want the next generation to share my pain.
Defend nothing. Explain nothing. Just send him [this clip](https://youtu.be/hmoAX9f6MOc?t=160) (from 2015, by the way!) and block him and be happy that your daughter will be happy and confident in the sure knowledge that you are doing right by your child.
I grew up in an incredibly transphobic family so i didn't realize I was trans until i was 18 but i knew i wanted to be a girl since i was 3. I knew i wanted to be able to get pregnant, i wanted to be able to just like be a girl, i tolerated being a boy because until bro recently i didn't know it was possible for me to be a girl but if i had magically transitioned one day i would have been so happy. My childhood dysphoria just made me so unhappy and miserable but i had no words to express what i was feeling because i was raised Catholic [am atheist now] and homeschooled and isolated and told that being trans was a mental illness and trans people go to hell, so i just repressed and repressed and almost ruined my life. I'm so happy for your daughter that she's being raised by parents who are actually supportive and actually love her, like seriously thank you for actually loving your daughter
If you MUST send a message I'd recommend sending a link to this article: 
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/stop-using-phony-science-to-justify-transphobia/
And leave it at that. They'll have to choose to learn from it but they can do that on their time. Be thankful this person only exists in the vacuum of Facebook and can be flushed away like a turd with the click of a button.
At the very least, their last comment is highly utilitarian and misogynistic. If someone chose to get the op, it's not because they want to have sex, it's because they'd feel happier with a different set of genitals. The way they phrase it makes it out like they treat women like walking vaginas. 

If you want more personal experience-based stuff, my experiences earlier on in my life often revolved around wishing for nothing more than to be the opposite sex, or pretending to be when people weren't around, or trying to look up how to do a voice for the opposite sex. The reason I couldn't come to terms with it until later was because I was never given it as an option and was forced into my gender roles, which made me miserable. Being misgendered or especially deadnamed nowadays feels less like a slap in the face and more like all of my closest friends and family members gathering in a circle to scream slurs and ridicule me. Any time it happens it ruins the day, or more. I could call back to the most recent time my mother accidentally deadnamed me (two hours or so before I normally go to sleep for the record) and I spent the rest of that day in tears. Explain to them that being rude to your daughter for something she cannot control and particularly in this manner is so, so destructive for her mental health. If you've ever heard transphobes cite the ""41% suicide rate"" statistic, that statistic refers to trans people who have been denied support by their families. Trans people who are accepted and have completed their transition are actually generally happier than cis people on average.

I'm not sure how much this will help but I hope it does
Also there's like a lot of post-op transbians right?
Soooooo creepy. What about her pleasure lol? What does it mean for cis women, their genitals are just to pleasure men and bear children? Too bad it seems she never experienced pleasure
also may i add that this is a 12 YEAR OLD GIRL WTF
I'm so sorry that you have been essentially forced to live a lie. I am a cis woman and I often put myself into a trans person shoes by imaging that I am stuck in a man's body. I know I'm a woman. I feel like a woman. I take all those feelings and imagine that I have a man's body. It feels *awful*.
Does your current wife not know you are really a woman? I'd like to offer you an ear if you ever need somebody to talk to ❤️
Thank you for sharing your experience with me. It really reinforces that I'm doing the right thing. 
If she turns round in a few years and decides she is a boy, or NB, then I will be here for that too.
At the end of the day, she's my baby and will always be my baby. As long as she is happy, healthy and not harming others, then idgaf.
I'm definitely going to reply. I just wanna get my thoughts in order first and make.sure I cover everything.
I am absolutely starting it with that!
This is brilliant! Thank you!
I'm definitely going to reply to them. I can't not. We have lots of friends in common and I have a sneaky suspicion that some others feel the same way.
After my reply, this person is getting blocked and I'll be asking any others who feel the same way to unfriend me.
He will definitely be getting blocked. I just wanna get my licks in first.
Yeah he knows me, but he doesn't know my daughter. 
If he did, he would know that she is 100% a sassy lil diva 💅🏻
She has *never* been a boy, even when she was a boy.

.....and omg that is going into my reply. Thank you for the inspiration xx
I hate that parents that accept their kids get praise for doing the absolute minimum that a parent should be doing anyway.
It's heartbreaking when I hear about people getting disowned for stuff like this that that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.
I don't care if anyone is 5 or 85. If they have been disowned by their parents for being part of the LGBTQIA+ community, I'm their new mum now ❤️

*To anyone reading this: my Inbox is always open if anyone needs to chat*
Sorry, my bad! I'm glad you corrected me before I replied. Have I made that word up? 😂
I really don't understand why other people care so much about something that has absolutely no effect on their life. I mean, ffs, my child transitioning has no effect on **my** life, so I don't get why random strangers are so arsed about it!
It's not in my nature to say fuck all
I really struggle with not having the last word and if I don't say anything back, I know this person will think they have ""won"". They know I'll always argue til I'm blue in the face.
>First off my daughter hasn’t decided on surgery yet she is x yrs, so I’d kindly appreciate it if you would stop thinking about her genitalia plz,

I love this! It would have never occurred to me to bring up this point.
They are part of my troll fam. It varies slightly but the gist is we pretend to be Christians who hate tattoos and weed. We do a whole satire thing. 
There are a few that love my daughter and they are the only ones she knows of.
I wish I had read this before I replied to him!. Here's what I said

The only thing that will change my mind about my daughter....is my daughter.
If she decides in the future that she's a boy, or NB, or something else, then I'll hold my hands up and say that on 27/03/22 I was wrong calling her a girl.
Idgaf who/what she feels like/presents as.
As long as she's happy, healthy and not hurting others, then I'm good.
And don't worry, my fb ""friend"" will be getting told, right before they get blokt

Honesty, I feel like I can't let it go cuz of the type of relationship we have. We troll together in a satirical way. We pretend to be Christian extremists that hate tattoos and weed. I've always had the last word. Just struggled this time cuz it was personal and I was so angry.

But I love some of the points you made and I'm making a note of them
My profile is locked down. This person was on my friend list.
I think the simplest is, ‘my daughter’s genitalia is none of your business and it disgusts me that that’s what’s on your mind’, then a block.
I know that anger really well. I have lost sleep for days over that type of anger and that type back and forth. I've gotten the last word and honestly didn't bring me any peace. That anger stays until you can move past it.

The reality is, once you've blocked them and push them out of your life, you won't even remember who had the last word. This is something you feel in this moment. If you want to reply, if you feel absolutely compelled too, it should be something simple. Just say something the effect of I'm a good parent who wants to do what's best for my child. And I know what's best for my own child. She is exactly who she says she is and I will always support her in that.
Late to the party.

“The fact that you are concerned about the genitals of a 12 year old makes me wonder if you don’t want my daughter to get the surgery because you would prefer to play with a 12 year olds penis.  If that is what you are admitting then I suggest you seek professional help.  If not, what impact does my daughters choices have on your life?  You are either a pedophile or a bigot and I want neither in my life.”
Tell them it's hard for you to imagine someone being that stupid, and move on.
Trying to explain them why they are wrong is impossible because they won't see it they will refuse..basically right now you are drinking poison and hoping they die. You are just suffering for no reason, just block them and be done
[deleted]
The simplest replies are often appropriate.  I'd simply tell them ""*You're a horrible hateful person and I hope someone treats you as badly as you treat and view transgender people""* /block.
I would save your mental energy by not bothering to reply to this. Simply block and then try to move on with your life.
Tbh, I've learned you can't explain it enough, it takes energy out of you, and they won't change their perspective. Just tell them you don't want anything to do with them anymore, and block them
It’s unfortunate but there is nothing you could ever say to change people like that’s minds. They will never change or see the wrong of their actions or mindsets.

The best thing you can do for your mental health is just block and move on.
Can people even see your page or comments after you block them though?
While I admire your desire to show them why they’re wrong, I doubt your words will do anything to change their mind. I advise you block and report them, and cut ties completely. Also block them on your daughter’s account, if she has one.

That desire for the final word is going to do more harm than good.
dw about it, you did the right thing, and also you sound like an amazing parent 💙💙

best of luck to both of you!! and ty for being so accepting towards your daughter!
OP, you're a good parent. I'm glad that your daughter has the support she needs <3
Oh she has a trans uncle that's amazing !! You're amazing!!  what amazing family she has!!
what's the book? I'm interested!
>""I'll actually be going with the advice of experts on this, have a nice life.""

I love this and will absolutely be saying it. Thank you. Xx
Thank you so much for your input. Anecdotes are very helpful with what I wanna slap my ""friend"" upside the head with xx
I'm really sorry that you weren't supported. I am confidently cis but I always try to put myself in the shoes of others and so I often imagine being trapped in a man's body. It is *awful*.
It's crazy to me that people care so much about something that affects them in no way whatsoever! Like why does this FB friend who lives thousands of miles away from me give a fuck about how my child lives their life??
I love you so much for that link!! I'm currently typing out my reply to him and I'm halfway through that clip and already know it's going in there!
Yeah, like I haven't started yet but I was amab but I know I am most likely lesbian lol
yeah lol... if trans women's vaginas are only for men's pleasure, then cis women's vaginas are only for men's pleasure and to birth their babies.

I got SRS for MYSELF. To stop feeling like I had the wrong genitals and suffering because of that. Sex was literally the last thing on my mind (even if still mattered). And when it comes to sex... I didn't get it to ""pleasure a man"", I got it to be able to have sex without feeling dysphoria, and pleasure myself.

This person is a creep that talks about kid's genitals on social media and a mysoginy perpetuator with the notion that if you dont have an uterus, your vagina is only good to pleasure men.

Imagine if she said that to a woman that was born with MRKH Syndrome (without a vaginal canal and uterus) that got genital surgery to create the vaginal canal. Or if she said that to a woman who had to remove her uterus due to cancer.

It's disgusting no matter how you look at it.
Thank you so much for your offer. You are an amazing person with an incredible heart. No I have not told my current wife or daughter. Really it’s me not them. I believe it will go well. I hope it will go well. I have been on a wait list to see a psychiatrist that specializes in Transitioning cases. I’ve been waiting since December. They followed up with me several weeks ago and said they are still really backed up. Heck I have waited this long to talk to someone what’s a few more months. I’ve already started slowly transitioning. And it is enough for now. As I said you are an amazing momma bear and your daughter is in incredible hands!!
Ohmygod you are like the best parent ever, I would wish my parents would be even ever so close to that, but I fear it’s not the case… (so I haven’t come out) Like genuinely this is amazing, every trans child deserves a parent like this…
It is my intention to accumulate more in the coming weeks, sort them into categories based on my observations of common anti-trans arguments, and then post a master list to this sub (including links).
Ah ok I didn’t realize about all the friends in common that makes sense why you’d want to stand your ground. I don’t know exactly what you should say but the part where they said your daughters hypothetical future would just be for a man’s pleasure is so messed up. I (late 30s cis M) have been in a relationship with a trans woman for almost a year now and it’s the most loving, respectful, fulfilling relationship of my life. Part of what I love about her is her strength and bravery and how much she knows herself, and that helps her see me too in a way previous partners haven’t. It sounds like your daughter has a great supporter in you and will grow up to be a great person. Sorry you’re dealing with this and wishing you the best
Do it lol. I have gotten a decent bit of hate in the past and I don't usually bother arguing unless I have a sassy comeback or something . Theyre not worth the anger tho it is nice seeing a protective parent on here
I know it's so infuriating, hoping other close friends/family are more accepting than that person. And gender dysphoria, or dysphoria, is being uncomfortable with your gender assigned  at birth  and things that come with that, such as looks, voice, genitals act. Body dysmorphia is similar, but not in regards to gender, just in regards to ones body. I probabaly didn't explain it the best but if you Google the difference between dysphoria and dysmorphia hopefully Google will be of help. Wishing you and your daughter a lovely day.
Then tell them you're cutting them off for their disgusting views before the block? Just don't give em a chance to respond. 

I know how it feels. My first year or so after coming out, I felt the full weight of transphobia crashing on me like an anvil. I felt like I had to fight every single bigot that came my way. 

It's healthier to just cut them out. <3
You're absolutely welcome 🤗
That reminds me of a friend I once had. We had fun being edgy and trolling people, then eventually I realised he was just a toxic person. I cut him out when he started lashing out at random people in my life.
Purge anyone not supportive.  They aren’t friends.
This. This person sounds creepy and pedophilic, so definitely call them out on it before blocking them. Maybe add ""and I am going to block you, because I don't involve myself with people who try to police children's genitalia."" So as to explain why, if they reply more nasty shit, you don't reply back.
Oooh I like this!
This.
This
Oh HELL yeah!! 😄👊🔥🔥🔥
This
Simple and very effective
Exactly! Like her gentials is what you're worried about?? And that description of what ""being transgendered"" is??? UM EW??
This is the one. Also I’m trans and barely have any genital problems either so it’s pretty normal (just hate pubic hair)
I am a recently out trans girl, and I approve this message

u/genderqthrowaway3 is right, u/tastyhedgehog but I'd also like to add it doesn't hurt to say that you don't appreciate people trying to talk about your daughters privates as though they know everything, or talking about them at all: what they may be or may become.
Good choice. Classy, efficient, and honest. Everyone here is right, this person ain’t a friend and if they are ignorant enough to speak this way to you about your support for your own kid then they abandoned common sense and decency a looong time ago.  

Its ironic (/s) that the same people who preach “my choice!” about not masking or vaxxing their kids feel like they can turn around and dictate your choice to let your girl express who she is. They can take a long hike til the reach the edge of their flat earth, and once there keep walking. 🙃

Thank you for being a supportive mamma—your daughter is the age I was when I was forced to present exclusively as binary to my AGAB. Its been a long time unpacking all that alone in adulthood. The world needs more parents like you. ♥️
There is such a wait time for everything! I'm in the uk and my daughter is still waiting for an appointment with GIDS to get her hormone blockers.
Have you thought about how to bring it up with your wife? Is she accepting towards the trans community in general? I often try to put myself in other people's positions (like I said before though, I'm cis, so please disregard my thoughts if they are ignorant), and I imagine that if I wanted to come out to someone, I would stick something on the telly about trans people. Then start up a conversation about the character. Maybe ""Boys don't cry"" or - more tentatively - Tomboy. The latter is a film with Michelle Rodriguez in. It also goes by the name The Assignment. Wikipedia the plot of the that one before you watch it though! While it is absolutely not a reflection of your situation, it would certainly open up an avenue of discussion.
Again, I'm sorry if my suggestions suck. I just try to imagine how I would feel and what I would do. Admittedly though, I haven't always made the best life choices 😂
I may not be OP, but I look forward to seeing that!
>the part where they said your daughters hypothetical future would just be for a man’s pleasure is so messed up.

I can't believe I'm saying this but that didn't clock with me. I'm just so angry that I read everything and still didn't take it in properly. Even now, I can't remember what else he said. I'm gonna go back and read it until it's burned into my brain. 
My daughter loves hearing about trans women that end up in loving relationships. She is bisexual but worries that she will never find someone. 
I will for sure mention to her that I stumbled upon someone on Reddit who is in a very happy relationship with a trans woman and all the lovely things you said about your girlfriend. Xx
No, you explained it perfectly! Thank you!
And luckily, nearly everyone in my daughter's life accepts her. Her dad is the only person who doesn't, but he's an abusive piece of shit that has never done a thing for her (even bdays and Xmas) so it's no loss. He was given every opportunity to accept her and he *almost* had us convinced until he let let his mask slip during an argument and outed himself as a transphobe. My daughter made the decision to cut him out of her life. I'm glad she finally sees him for the monster he is.
All the more reason to cut him out of your life. You do not owe him any explanation
It's not your job to do their emotional labor. That's what they're asking you and your child to do. They want someone else to reassure them of the ""rightness"" of the binaries they grew up within. 

Well...it's sad that they want to remain a stick in the mud and project their insecurities onto a 12y-old.

What you're reading is, most likely, someone's identity feeling threatened and them not knowing or understanding why...and they probably can't recognize it because its never been threatened like this before. The lashing out? That's their identity clawing to maintain its security and position of ""being right"". It's what happens when anything feel backed into a corner.

To admit there are any other options beyond A-B, that there is a spectrum and slope...that throws their whole life into question. That they must attack a child in defense of their own insecurities -- that's the sad part here. I'm sorry for folks like this.

But again, it is not your duty to do their emotional and philosophical labor, to make them feel more comfortable, or do anything other than treat them with civil dispassion.

You may want to get a ""parting shot"" in, to make you feel like you had a retort. But unless you can do it was the dispassion necessary to not give them anything to feel justified about, your best move is likely a non-response, block, and cut them out of your family's life. 

TL;DR: Unless you're a lifeguard to who knows how to respond safely, don't let the drowning victim take you under with them.
Transgender or otherwise, an adult man talking about your child’s genitals (in a sexual context!!!!!) is wildly inappropriate. Point that out to him and block him.
And confidently incorrect.
If that is how he is choosing to speak to you about your daughter, plus you are certain that he is being genuinely honest about his feelings on this matter, then I really can't see any reason to keep him in your life. I have quite a few close friends, but I can't think of a single one of them that would allow me to stay in their life if I were to purposefully say things about their children that would be abusive if said directly to their child. 

I do understand the desire to jab back, but if he has this attitude towards your child when he's known you for 10 years.... I say just block him from your life, and save yourself some trouble.
He’s not going to change his views. He will continue to cause you harm.
Cutting out my ""troll"" friend who was just plain toxic under the mask of ""it's a joke!"" was the best choice for my mental health I have ever made lol. Do yourself a favor and give yourself some grace- neither you nor your daughter owe an explanation to someone who has now twice shown they will not listen to you. He just wants to be right :/ If he still won't change after you pour your heart out, it hurts much more than just telling them to never talk to you again.
Tbh, it might be easier to teach math to a dog than to actually get through to transphobes.
The dog will still love you after it fails too!
""As I can see, you perfectly encapsulate the average transphobe in that they're not that different from a hyperactive cat on adderall. Neither can grasp basic concepts, will never make a meaningful impact in the world and act like assholes and infants. However catss have atleast one person that loves them while you just cling to things that arent your business to make people feel bad about things that dont affect you for the faintest glimmer of hope to escape the bitterness thst is the life you built for yourself""

This is my routine response to transphobes. When they mention me having copied it word for word from a previous discussion with a transphobe I usually follow it up with 

""Youre a copy paste transphobe, so you get a copy paste reply.""
It looks like it got deleted unfortunately
Thank you for the ideas. I know I only get one chance and I need to make it as comfortable for her as I do for my daughter. My wife is apart of an LGBTQ+ Ally program through her work. So I am hoping that helps pave the way. My wife is very intuitive and I am sure she has noticed me working on my voice and mannerisms. She sometimes quips. You more womanly than I am. Which would give me an opportunity. My daughter tells me all the time a closet is no place to live. So need to handle this gently for them and sooner then later for me. I would really like to have a counselor at my side when I do it. Or at least on call when I do it.
Please do :)

And yeah the transphobic obsession with genitalia and the idea that trans people and those who love them are perverts is so revealing of how sad and empty their own love and sex lives must be. I’d feel sorry for them if they weren’t so hateful
Honestly, report that message. That is pedo-level saying that all your 12 year old daughter will be is a human fleshlight is so messed up. Honestly if you call out the reasons for bringing up genitalia online this will hit harder to them
Thank you for your reply. You have given me plenty of food for thought and I will be incorporating some of your reply onto my response to that bum flavoured cock goblin. Xx
Oh yes absolutely, didn't even occur to me like that.
Dogs are actually listening to you, something transphobes never learned to do
At least the dog will try.
True

I have seen a few very well trained dogs who can do basic math
Dogs are too damn good. 🥰 I love my fuzzy pupper.
It works when I click on it?
It's awaiting mod approval.
Animals usually have already some kind of automatic math that they use to know how many predators there is a place or the distance between them and other point, you just need to figure out how to teach math to a dog in dog mathematics. 

Different from a transphobe, that don't have basic knowledge of the things they're talking about, so it's impossible to teach them how to act in human society.

After much deliberation and everyone’s help here on r/trans I finally managed to come out to my parents through a letter. They fully accept me! For the first time for what feels ages I’m crying out of happiness!	"From tv series I found out that apparently when you murder someone you get ‘the shakes’ (hands start to shake uncontrollably)
I swear that on exactly the moment I pressed send in my mailbox the same happened to me. It felt like a meltdown and if it wasn’t so late that I collapsed out of exhaustion, I probably would have had a hartattack!!
Can stop crying though:(

Edit: thank you all so much for the kind words and awards!! Without all of you supporting me so much I would never had the courage to finally make this big step!!💕

I did experience some serious relapse though as you can see in an update post below in the comments:( still a bit proud of my self for showing my self and fortunately I also have strong support from my gf too:)"	"That's awesome! Glad to hear it went well!
I got the shakes when my friends found out on accident, but they accepted me. Feels like you are flexing a muscle for years and finally get to relax. Liberating, right?
Update: so I just got of the phone with my mom.. She's wandering somewhere outside in the pouring rain "" catching her breath"". I could clearly hear she was crying too but definitely not out of relief or happiness. She was clearly in shock and when i asked about how my dad was doing, she said he has a very hard time coping with this as he clearly sees me as his 'little boy'.

So once again the tears of joy have turned into ones of sadness and sorrow:( And it feels like I've made everything worse and more complicated! I f*ng hate my life right now...
Congrats to you, i'm so happy for you. Now you can relax and look forward to living your best life.
I'm so glad they accepted you! I also started shaking pretty bad when I came out 😅
That is amazing, congrats, I came out to my parents using a message as well and pressing the send button was one of the hardest things I ever did, and I dont regret it, good luck
Yasss queen!!
That is awesome!! Congratz!! So happy for you. Wish everyone's story was that happy. 😘💜
Sounds like you just experienced euphoria. Congratulations 👏☺️
Congratulations, i know its a huge weight lifted off of you.  Keep doing you and living your best life.  ❤
I'm so happy for you ! I'm glad you did send it in the end :)
Congratulations!! Nows when you get to start being happy all the time, it's way better than the closet lol
Congratulations! It’s always so great to see someone have a happy story
another positive family, always good to see this
so proud of you, i know how hard it is and you’re amazing for that!! we’re here for you💗
awww it’s so awesome to hear people being accepted my their families :) now i’ve just got to work up the courage to tell mine
Congrats, it's so good to hear that! I know exactly what you're talking about. When I first came out to a friend I was shaking and a nervous mess the whole time. Every time since it's gotten easier and easier, to the point where when I finally came out to my parents I didn't shake at all. It's such a weight to be lifted off your shoulders, and I'm glad they were supportive of you!
that is so awesome congrats! i came out to my mom today as well and she asked me if she wanted to show me how to braid my hair and get a padded bra!
That's great, I hope you the best for the future
Thats amazing! I feel so happy for you! I hope i'm brave enough to come out to my parents soon...
🌹☀️❤️❣️💕💞💗💝💖
Yess!!\~ Congratulations!
Awesome
I came out to my parents not long ago and my heart aches for you. From one stranger to another I really really am proud of you and you’ll do great things now that you have reached a point where you can seriously be who you are and smile in the face that you always knew you had
I know how you feel I remember when I told my friend who I've known for most of my life I had this, I sat there for a solid 40 minutes staring at the message before sending and then started shaking from a mix of fear of how she would react and excitement that id finally told someone until she checked it and ended up calming me down. It's made me think it's going to be easier for me to do it via letters and messages rather than telling people in person as I struggle enough with talking to people day to day. The lovely people of Reddit such as yourself have helped me realise that this is an option of how I can do it instead of getting too scared in person of what could happen and how they will react so thank you.
I’m so stoked for you. It really warms my heart to hear that parents are accepting. It’s been 9 years since I’ve spoken to my family, so I’m glad others don’t have to endure the BS I went through. 

Congrats man!
Yes!! I still can’t believe it! It feels so unreal!!
I hope they come around
Give them time. They need space to grieve for their old idea of you. 

If you have the resources or someone you trust who can talk to them, let them have a Q & A where they can learn how, no this isn't a phase, and yes you are still you. A lot of trans stuff just isn't common knowledge in the cis community, and will help them make their own mental transition if they can get some assistance.
tyvm! it doesn't feel relaxing yet but I'm sure that will change hopefully soon!
thank you very much:) I have yet to see them in person though and the thought of it scares the hell out of me!
I still have tremendous doubts over if they say they accept me but in reality they don’t. How twisted is that??
Thank you!:)  Now they know I need to gather the courage to face them in person. I’m not out of the dark woods yet:(
Oh God please! I’ve waited way too long for this!
Yeah, the amount of horrorstories I’ve read over the years got me so paranoid!
Even though my parents are left oriented atheists I was still full of doubts. I can imagine how hard this must be  for those who grew up in a religious and or conservative family!
Thanks for your kind words, that’s pretty reassuring:)
That sounds so good! Congrats yourself!:)
Thank you:)
Yes a letter is absolutely a positive way for you can take as much time for it as you are happy with:) I’m so glad for this community here on Reddit and very glad to help others as yourself too:)
I’m sorry to hear that!:( I hope your doing fine?:)
I'm a year and a half in and I still get that feeling, its the best.
Just like myself I know they will meet time to come to terms:) I haven’t given up hope yet!
Deep breath. This is new information for them, youve known a much much longer time. Give them some grace in adjusting. I hope they come around in a positive direction. Either way this is a positive direction for you.

Edit sorry this was meant for OP
You’re absolutely right:) I took a lot of time for me to accept my self, I can’t expect others to do that in an instant. Still frustrating though!
My parents are very accepting, and yet are still *massive* dysphoria triggers for me. There's nothing wrong with giving yourself space if that is what is necessary.
Sounds incredibly normal, to be honest. You've built this up for years in your head. Your brain isn't going to let go of that anxiety so easily. (It's a defense mechanism, after all. If our brains easily forgot fear, we wouldn't learn from it. Useful when dealing with wolves, less useful with coming out.)

Be kind to yourself, because you're worth loving, and be kind to them and remember all the times they have already accepted you. Sure, this is a big one, but if they love you, it won't be a deal breaker.
I see why you would feel that way.  You will only know if they truly accept you is by there actions.  Keep you chin up and keep doing you.
But you are closing in on the edge of the woods. They know, talking about it face to face might be hard, but you already took the biggest step imho. Keep on keeping on! It might be a very scary time, but I believe you have the strength to do it, sending that letter is an indication of that.
same! my parents are left atheists so they have no religious or political views to not accept me, but i’m still scared - because my dad’s one year off being classed as a boomer and god does he act like one, but i think his only reaction would be being confused and not understanding it all properly.
thanks!! ❤️
For the first 5 years it was really hard. Not having anyone to fall back on or celebrate any holidays with. 

Thankfully I met someone amazing that has provided that sense of security my family failed to provide me with. 

This isn’t about me though. This is about you! I’m truly happy your family is willing to go through this incredible journey with you.
I so hope so! Thanks for the confidence boost:)
It's *profoundly* frustrating, especially if their behavior is a dysphoric trigger for you. They'll get there though. It will be great for you all to finally be on the same page.
That’s good to know and solid advice, I’ll take it!:)
Thanks to your reply I survived today:) I was better prepared!
I had a talk face to face which went pretty ok though I got triggered quite a lot. With stuff like “but you’re too tall, I never see women that tall on the street” (I’m 6’4”≈1.94m) and “your shoulders are too broad” sigh..
Thank you for your kind words:)
Will do:)
I’m glad you found someone amazing!:) And thank you for the kind words! Big hug for you!
I really hope so!
I'm glad you survived, though it sounds rough. Personally, my response to ""I've never seen a woman that tall"" would be ""Well, now you have."" After all, you aren't pretending to be a woman, you *are* one. 

I have similar issues. (6'2"", 220 lbs mostly muscle, pretty much opposite of traditionally feminine) But I have to remind myself that no matter what my dysphoria tells me, I already *am* a woman, regardless of my outward appearance. 

Hell, if you stuck my brain in a jar with life support, I'd be super pissed, but I'd still be female. Nothing about this meat-mech I call a body can change that. It would be nice to have the decor updated, to be sure, but even that wouldn't make me more me.

Right now they're stuck thinking that you're trying to be what you're not. With time and luck and love, they'll come to see that you're only trying to express what you are.
Me too, we're all cheering for you. And if they don't then we'll still be here to help you pick yourself up afterwards.
I really hope so😊"	n7n2iq	trans	1467	0.98	2021-05-08 11:15:27
Well, I've gotten to the point that even if I don't pass 100% I look fucking great and I'm happy! 🍾😌		"You absolutely look great but being happy is the most important part!
Damn right you look great
Not 100%? Can't see it, honestly.
Happy is the goal and you are certainly 😍

Lovely that you feel happy, but girl you HELLA pass <3
I love your hair! You look great!!
That's amazing I'm so happy for you. I'm hoping to have the same confidence as you one day.
Okay, if I weren't in the middle of a 700 mile drive right now I would be replying to everyone, ty so much for the comments 😭❤❤❤ you're all super sweet and I hope you're having a beautiful day you fucking lovebugs 🥰😋
You look like you pass to me!

Whoaaaa u so pretty dawg
Oh my gosh, your hair is amazing, dear! Love the highlights!
You're absolutely right, you're looking straight up fire, but the most important thing is that you are happy!
Yes! You’re gorgeous! 

I think it may have just been internalized bs but I used to be afraid of being some undefined hybrid between man and woman.  but since starting HRT just 2 weeks ago, the tiny little changes have me feeling so much happier with myself and I feel much prettier and at peace now. I’m now very excited to get further along and change more. 

Best of luck luv 🥰 again u look amazing
Honestly ur hair is beautiful im trying to grow mine out rn I hope it comes out like urs
Honestly I think you do pass 100% based on this photo, you look great! Either way being happy is the most important part.

You look like a long harried dude.
Changes can be slow but just wait, I'm really surprised at how much it has done in the past year and a half 😅 thank you ❤😌
Listen, I can see this clearly isn't your main account. You're negativity really doesn't affect me because I get enough from myself dude. Everyone in these forums is honest with themselves and living the best lives they can because we all realize life is short and we want to be happy. We are some of the nicest people so truthfully I would love to change your mind on how you feel about us. If you need to talk and be educated on the process and reasoning for transitioning you're welcome to reach out. I hope life gets easier for you and that you become a more understanding person."	oypbnf	trans	1461	0.99	2021-08-05 19:04:50

sorry, i just think of that meme ""look at this dude"" but i definitely meant it in an endearing way

i have no idea what the context of that meme is tho, so hopefully its as wholesome as i meant it to be lol
Hey friend, it’s easy to get down on ourselves when we see someone else farther along in their journey. I sometimes have the same reaction. I found that changing my thought process helped. “I look forward to announcing my 18 months someday.” It helps, but baby steps are so critical to changing our thoughts. I hope you see how wonderful you are and I hope you look forward to your journey too.
Thank you!

Today marks the one-year anniversary since I had my FFS (Facial Feminization Surgery) with Dr. Toby Mayer. So... Happy Bday to my face! lol.		"While I think you might be wearing some makeup, your skin still looks so much better! Was it surgery that helped the lines or something else?
Were you a Ranger? I've been seeing a handful of other vets on trans subs and I'm glad I'm not alone. And happy birthday to your face! You look great!
Your Dr did a wonderful job! Happy birthday to your beautiful face! 🥳
The difference is uncanny. You're an entirely changed woman (in a good way) yet you can still tell that it's the same person.
Alright queen, go off then 💅🥰
You look like you've aged in reverse! How wonderful. I hope you are happy with your results, you have every reason to be.
Beautiful! The pink hair looks really good on you!
You look great and a billion times happier!
you look amazing!
I mean just beautiful!! 🥰
I went to him as well!  I was also a Ranger as well!
Girl your hair is dope
And such a lovely face too! 🥰
😍😍😍
FFS is so remarkable to me. You can tell there is obviously something different between 2018 and 2020 but if you asked me to point it out, I can't exactly tell you what has been done. You're a whole different person but the same one at the same time! Either way you look great now! And happy face birthday! Lol
Oh, haha. Happy birthday to your face!
You look amazing! 🥳
Has anyone ever told you how much you look like Gates McFadden?

Happy birthday, beautiful face!
Looking good! I really like the glasses!
Adorable love!
what the fuck (in a good way)
You look great!!!
You look great!
Hansom boy, but so much nicer as a pretty girl.
Well hey there cutie pie
Oh it is better. Surgery did help a bit, but I also take MUCH better care of it, now. Hormones changes (softens) the skin, quite a bit, too and Botox is a girl's best friend :-)
Decades ago. lol
We need to stick together!  I was in the Army as well.
Army checking in as well and I totally agree it's hard to reconcile who I was to whom I am becoming. I will hopefully start hormones next week after a visit to PP as the VA is taking thier sweet time getting me booked into endocrinology.

Its hard for me to reconsile who I was then with me now, I think we had an especially strange journey. Thanks for sharing its taking me a while to find myself after coming from a hypermasculine background and it helps me to see other women who have dealt with the same thing.
I never use the VA if I can help it, good luck with getting that stuff taken care of. I hope the pp works out better.
There are dozens of us!!!

Yes! You go girl!
It's so good, hormones are the signals you brain uses for alot of the body, when you start running on the right ones for your brain that alone I've found has been a huge difference even before the physical changes started.
That’s awesome! Tho keep in mind that can put a lot on your chest

Jk jokes aside this is amazing!!

:)))))
I'm excited to see the results! :)))

Omg good lmaoooo i was worried-
omg SOOOOO jealous

&#x200B;

thats the ONE thing, like the ONLY thing i need to make life complete.... ughhhhh lol 

congrats babe
I wish reddit had voice comments simply because i want to voice act that.
You could say that I’m on a trans-mission to get some estrogen
Tits are pretty awesome
Thank you, and good luck getting your own! :)
*sneaks into your room* XD
maybe a 1shot dnd campaign XD

edit: HOLY SHIT I NEED TO MAKE THIS
indeed! :)
Oh I know I have never been more disphoric than the time when I was thirteen and had gynocastia. It’s when guys have legit titties. I was barely realising I was trans at that point and then my parents freaked out about my new tits and made the doctors give me medication to stop them. *sad trans girl that cannot transition noises and had their tits taken noises*
Good luck- im not allowed to start E 😎
Lolol yes.
rip i hope you can soon
i’m hoping to start in a few months maybe
i’m adding it to a list of stuff to do
Why not start now? You already have it right?
Dm me when its ready lmaoo
nah we still trying to find a provider :( also i wanna start 3 months before summer so that it kicks in a little before summer and i have summer to make the full change
that’ll be awhile i’ve never wrote a campaign
I would start asap. It will take a year at least just for boobie alone, it takes 10ish years or something for everything else to happen so asap is better.
Im a dumbass- when i said you had it already, I thought you were OP for some reason lmaooo
Ohhh i know i was mostly joking lol
\*giggle\*
HMMMMMM how do you know???
are you the little demon stealing estrogen and making trans people?
if i defeat you will all the trans girls out there become happy again?
which valiant warrior shall complete this task?
Lol why?😅
Yk. I love your energy. This is why i stay up till 3AM 🤠
nothing, that was just funny to me. :)
hey it’s 3 am for me too :)
*not so long ago in the mysterious land of toronto canada*
*there was a little demon stealing all of the estrogen from the citizens*
Yk, i saw a really cute person earlier lookin like a gothic elf.

Unironically I'm a forever DM, I'd run that, DM me if interested :>"	romb46	trans	1439	0.98	2021-12-26 01:37:56
I AM SO RELIEVED!!!	"I’m gonna speak about politics but no debate, just a massive relief.

I’m French, and today, French people elected our president. The choice was between a racist, transphobic and generally lgbt-phobic woman named Marine Le Pen, and a man called Emanuel Macron. 
Since several months, I was afraid Marine Le Pen would be our new president, because she ( and her party ) is hard towards lgbt+ ( and specially the T and + ) people.
So the new president is Emanuel Macron. His precedent mandate was good for us lgbt+ people ( end of the conversion therapies, no more obligated sexual abstinence time - 6 months - for gay blood donors… ), whereas Mrs Le Pen’s party voted to exclude transgender from the banishment of conversion therapies.

I’m so relieved and happy, I was really scared and stressed and didn’t know what I was gonna do if Mrs Le Pen had been elected. I love you all and wish you all to have as much luck for your next democratic events as we, French trans people, had !"	"As an American, I breathed a sigh of relief. I’ve never technically been to France, and probably will never go, but I’m happy to see them kick fascism to the curb. Macron may not be the best President ever, but anything is preferable to a fascist.
I'm not necessarily psyched about Macron but same, I was so frkn relieved when I saw the result. I'm still afraid that the fascist got such a high score tho, and I hope we'll manage to build a healthier political landscape in the future
This year we have ellections on brasil, I'm really scared that maybe Bolsonaro can win, even after genocides
I would like to know how LaPen a fascist can get so close to being elected president twice?!?
As someone a short swim away in Scotland, I'm so relieved for yous!!!
I'm not crazy about Macron but this election was a no brainer for the French people. I'm so glad that Macron pulled it out. In less-covered news, Slovenia also had elections today where they ousted a right-wing, authoritarian-leaning government and replaced it with a more liberal, pro-democracy government. Two big defeats for the far right in Europe today!
To my understanding she's basically just a full on fascist, so this was basically just like the 2020 USA election but for France. I was also pretty nervous about this one, glad to see that she lost.
Meanwhile in America, I'm horrified Trump will get another term 🙃

It's good to see some nations getting it right, though. It honestly keeps me going at times.
Honestly, while it *is* a relief that Le Pen isn't elected, I'm fucking angry at Macron *somehow* being president after the shit show that was the last 5 years
I'm not French, I'm Polish, but I've also been waiting impatiently for the results of the elections and I'm so relieved Le Pen didn't win. So happy for you guys x
Vive la France. I was watching this closely. My congratulations, Love wins over hate again. You keep fighting. All you have to do is exist and exude nothing but love and we shall be victorious. Fireworks tonight. So much winning.
I was watching the election with bated breath, and I’m glad to see that my trans siblings in France not have to deal with that!
like a friend of mine said : ""we're sure she will advocate against LGBTQIA+ rights, but we're not sure he won't.""
This year is election year on my country, and i feel that i'm in the same situation, but not such in an extreme way

Still, i'm a little nervous about what's going to happen
Love from Poland, at least you got lucky :')
J'ai été soulagé aussi même si j'aurais préféré que ce soit Mélenchon qui passe avec son progressisme. Là on reste juste sur la même chose alors que pour l'éducation et tout c'est le bordel, même les profs le disent ils galèrent avec le gouvernement de Macron. Enfin on ne peut pas tout avoir, comme tu l'as dit au moins le Pen n'est pas passée
Agreed, may Le Pen take the hint and just leave politics.
Whoever you are for, you can’t deny he did things for us and he’s way better than far right
Let’s hope he doesn’t!
Giving simple solutions to complex problems, using minorities to scare majority, demagogy at a high level, making promises she can’t keep, speaking in people’s name and way more. Fascism always found its way, in France and everywhere around the world. An economical crisis ( covid and Ukrainian war ) helps this a lot to be fair.
Unfortunately farcist leaders are de result of all problems of a country.

Here in Brazil we're facing our disgusting president have chance to be elected again..
Heyy Scottish friend ! Love from France ❤️
Yeah I saw that and I’m so glad about that ! I feel  European Union and Europe generally speaking are becoming better space for everyone, except for a little number of countries which are directly exposed to the ongoing war. I hope this will continue and give further results !
Yeah, watching America endorse a fascist might have shown the rest of the world what that can do to a country...

I honestly think people in other nations are more aware of how horrible letting fascism into governments is because of it. Fuck, I bet seeing Putin annihilate his own country is also having the same effect. 

Anyway, it's America, you can never stop hearing about America, even when you don't want to.
Not here to do politics but was it all his fault ? Covid and Ukraine war aren’t his choices actually, and they took basically half the presidency. He clearly deserves a second chance
Actually we are pretty sure he won’t, if we see the last 5 years and his objectives. He has bad ministers, I can’t deny that but he did good things for us, and most of his deputies are and let’s hope will be former socialists, and they always voted in favor of laws that were good for us ( conversion therapies, no more abstinence time for blood donors, etc… )
Not even terf tbh. It would really hurt my feminist heart to say that since terfs refer to themselves as feminists, which she clearly does not.

Edit : this comment became useless since you got the “terf” part away
I'm definitely relieved Lepen wasn't elected. She's not even comparable to him, for us, for democracy, etc
But Macron isn't all good. He has a role in the rise of Far-rights and some member of LREM are borderline terfish.
Sorry if I'm kind of a bummer
""better than Le Pen"" may as well be Macron's slogan it seems
Mélenchon would have been even better, not just for LGBT+ people, but also for people affected by economic inequality, high rents etc. (things which also strongly affects LGBT+ people, who are overproportionally at risk of being poor).
Of course
In other words some of the people's in France are as gullible as they are here in the United States of America.
If that is a reference to Russia, I'm hoping that Ukraine will be the graveyard of the Russian Federation in it's current format. If it's not a reference to Russia, I'd be very interested to know what you mean! 😃
Yeah, point well made
Yeah I saw your point and took it out
The f in terf should stand for fascist
This is how I feel about every US presidential election for some time now. It’s like a choice between a disappointing candidate and a dangerous one.
Nan you’re totally right. I am a LREM militant to be honest but I hate some of the representatives ( Darmanin, formerly Benallah, etc… ). Yet I like Schiappa and Moreno a lot, mostly for the laws against sexist harassment, rapes and domestic abuses, and formations of police to take complaints for those violences.

Edit : I mean there that as any political group they are as previously said, not perfect, but they have good points and did good things for feminism and lgbt+ people
Or in United Kingdom or in Germany, Russia, Brazil, and way more ! That’s exactly it. Fascism relies over those people actually
Yeah it’s Russia but also Hungary and Poland. Hungary elected again Viktor Orbán ( more and more of an authoritarian ) in this context of war started by Russia and Poland still have their hard conservative government ( no abortion … )
It’s fine haha, I just preferred to explain why I made this comment :)
I wouldn’t say I think President Macron was or is disappointing but more that he has done some errors which I hope he will correct during the five next years. I would have been disappointed in a extreme vs extreme vote, but not by him actually
And actually, if we count the father, it is the third time : 2002, 2017 and now 2022. They have never been that near to presidency tho
Yes, Hungary and Poland have been going down the wrong path for awhile now, and if I'm not mistaken Orbán just won re-election =/ I'm also nervous that the current goodwill towards Ukrainian refugees in those countries will fade as the war drags on and fuel more right-wing discontent. But for today, let's just enjoy the victories in France and Slovenia : )"	ub3hd4	trans	1435	0.96	2022-04-24 20:25:49

Do you ever just look at fellow trans people and just wish you could give your body to them so they'd be happy? I'm ftm and whenever I see a trans woman I wish I could just swap our bodies.		"I have often wondered if we will see genitalia swaps in the future.

Where you find two compatible people and they have a swap surgery, theoretically it’s already done separately, so i could see it in the future.
YES All the damn time 😤 like please!! I will whole heartedly trade you!! Beware of the hips though! One of them is definitely a lie X3
yeah... like some kind of brain-swapping machine...(~‾x‾)~
I’ve only ever seen one other trans person and I was so shy I couldn’t talk to them. They were so confident it was amazing.
Yeah bro would you like a body that can grow a full beard in under 2 weeks. Trade you
I’m gender fluid, I’m never happy ;-;



(All jokes, I’m very happy and very happy with how my transition is coming)
I always make jokes after a trans masc gets top surgery like ""hey do you mind if I have the rest? I mean youre not gonna use it so it'd be a shame to go to waste""
All the damn time
This is a sweet idea, but I personally like my body. Despite being born male, my body IS the body I was meant to have, and I’m at home in it. I am a woman, but being assigned male at birth doesn’t discredit that.
If I could give my uterus, I 100% WOULD.

Thankfully, I'm OK most of the time on the body dysphoria front, being nb and all that. But no matter how femme I might feel that day, as soon as my body does anything regarding a cycle, I just want to yeet a certain organ.

Fuck that noise.

If someone wanted it, I'd donate.
One of my closer friends is a trans boy, we talk about it all the time
I'm always like: ""UTERUS FOR SALE! Only for my lifetime, a 100% off!""
Organ sale over here. 

I wish that would work.... I don't want mine....
Someone please take these G cups off of me I beg. I just wanna be flat
Soul swapping would be a nice skill.
Me and my boyfriend have joked about swapping our chests lol. Wish it was possible
100%
Same. Literally same. I was talking to this girl who was talking about the things she hates about her body and what she wished her body was like, and the things she was talking about not wanting was what I wanted and what she was talking about wanting was what I’m dysphoric about, I wish we could just switch and make things easier for the both of us.
All. The. Freaking. Time. Mtf here. I'm naturally stocky, very thick boned, broad shoulders, short but incredibly thick/muscular legs, naturally big and strong pecs. And when I complain to my other trans friends who wish they had my body instead, the dream of being able to just....switch? Is overwhelming.

>I'm ftm and whenever I see a trans woman I wish I could just swap our bodies.

Really even a post op trans woman? 

I understand where you were coming from with this post but what your saying can sound dysphoric to some of us.

For example I never got facial or body hair, I'm short, before surgery I had small infertile gonads, my voice is high pitched, no Adam's apple, and i was socialized as female.  Your post makes it seem like trans women are just men, who look different because of presentation and clothing, and our bodies are no different from biological Males, which is not true.

I wouldn't ask a my friend whose a trans man to swap bodies with me or I wish I had his body, he's 5'10 with hair all over his body, deep voice, and a muscular body, we would both get dysphoric if we switched bodies, because now we would have to transition all over again.

I'm not trying to come off as insensitive I just think post like these don't sound as good as people think they do.
That would be an awesome future. Let's make it happen.
Yeah me too
I feel the same way. It would be so great if we all could just trade bodies.
I thought the same thing lmao
I agree 100% MTF and FTM should be able to swap bodies. That would make things sooo much easier.
I swear. I got a big ol' tittied body with Pixar mom syndrome and am basically hairless for some strange reason. Please, any amount of body hair will do
dude, if I could swap bodies with you then I 100% would.
My wife and I joke that we wish we could just ""swap parts"" I'd gladly give her my top and bottom pieces for her bottom ones. 

Alas, maybe some day.
I would really love to donate the tiddies to a trans woman, they’re not great but I’m sure they would go to a loving home lol
Yee… no. I’ve yet to know someone who likes my male body, I mean, even I don’t want it, so I don’t know who could possibly would want to have it…
That would definetly be nice
Yea sometimes, I like bein a custom build model tho
Gosh that has always been my biggest dream! I would love to swap so much!
I would totally be down. But they're paying extra for my tattoos xD
I'm ftm and my best friend is mtf, we talk abt that a lot hahah! Especially since we're super close, like, if I can get a random stranger's kidney why cant I give her my chest?? I just want to have her body and she can have mine and we'll live happily every after, but NO.
I wanna be able to trade body parts like Pokémon. I’ll just stand around inside a hospital/Walmart and whenever anyone tries to talk to me I’ll just say “do you have boobs and a vagina? I’ll trade you for my penis and flat chest!” Then we’ll both be happy.
I know right, the person might not find your body ideal but atleast it's a start for them, but then you start going into the realm of everyone who knew you before the swap would see the person in your body and think they are you so, but let's say you told everyone that you are swaping bodies then It could work I guess.
I often ask my partner if they want to trade
i think a lot about a show: altered carbon. some of you guys probably know abt it but in it you can swap bodies like shells, and i immediately thought about how trans people could then go about body swapping w/ the people who need their base-set, just a wholesome thought :p
In a group conversation on zoom we have been discussing about uterine transplant and if transgender men would donate there uterus to transwomen. So far i forget if they have started this but it would be great if there were a medical type of way to just sign away your uterus one day well to donate it, right? It would be nice if we could somehow help eachother out...I'm not sure if it'd work the other way around but it would be nice right?
Honestly same. I've got a pair of boobies anyone want em??? Free of charge i swear, they're  secondhand but they're good I think!
I make this joke all the time with one of my friends. She’s mtf and I’m ftm. we always joke about it like trading cards 😂 

“I’ll give you TWO boobs for one penis, deal?”

“Deal!”

If only
I mean, I don't think a trans woman would want my body anymore, tbh. But I understand where you're coming from.
Gotta vemno them some tiddy
I'm trans femme nonbinary and my spouse is trans masc nonbinary. They have 34H tits, I'm a 38C. They have told me several times if they could give me their boobs they would.
bro same I thought I was the only one
Yes
If this was possible, I’d pay my life savings
Yep...I'd love to hop into a 5'5"" afab 120 lb body and trade them a built 5'11"" 230lbs athletic amab body 

Maybe some day...in the meantime I'll keep lurking r/tallgirls and give my up vote nods. ""Damn right sister...we tall and proud!"" 😜
Read the first part without really reading the subreddit and thought i joined some REAL questionable subreddit
I would gladly switch bodies with someone who's ftm if it were possible. If only it could be that easy
Yes! Often.
I wanna give my penis and all of my body hair to a trans man. I don't want it.
I often think, that at some point all trans folk have thought this.. just cause, it seems we're nicer than others....
YES! Though perhaps in a few decades or centuries we could use nano machines to change chromosomes to make our selves truly the opposite sex.
I wouldn’t wish my body prison I’m trapped in on anyone.
Yea I think about it a lot because I'm so unhappy w my agab and I wish I could swap w opposite agab just so we could both be happy
I would swap in a heartbeat!
Yeah sure. I'm pretty sure I have enough boobage to supply 3 or 4 trans women with d cups. 

Please take them lol
I'm mtf with 2 ftm best friends and we very often talk about how we wish we could just yoink our shit off of ourselves and give to the other 😂
I wish I make that joke all the time with my ftm friends and they say I wish all the time
i feel like we all share that
Omg yes. Like, give me yours and I'll give you mine and then we can both be happy.
That’s so touching! You have a heart of gold Shim!
*cries in Cyberpunk*
EVERY TIME
Yes. Please. PLEASE. I'd totally give my body to a wanting ftm, cause it kills me too. I'm sure there's plenty of people out there, that we could find a mutually agreeable way to work things out. Transition is beautiful, but terrible , and not everyone is so lucky to be able to...
I'm transmasc and my gf is transfem

I wish we could switch bodies

Especially cause she's hot af
I think one day I could come across someone who I deeply resonate with and that could happen spontaneously
I wish I could. Even if it didn’t mean receiving a bio male body in return… I just wanna give a trans woman a body she’d be more happy and comfy in, that she can feel like actually reflects her.
Me too man, me too
I have, but then someone pointed out that that's how you get Get Out, and I don't want to get Get Out.
Oh I love you ❤️❤️
Head transplants are actually a thing thanks to a german scientist in 1945 who was successful being that the subject lived for 30 seconds fully functionable an everything but sadly died……….imagine what goes on nowadays??
 Yeas that would be so awesome ;-;
Yea... i think that... quite a bit
the amount of comments I made to my transmasc friends about this like ""let's swap :)"" or ""your tiddies for my pp""
I always dream about a far future when we would have the technology of body swap in a way that wasn't risky. Where a trans man and a trans woman, both pre-op and pre-hrt, could just go and swap. They would organize their lives, tell to each family about their decision and their new bodies, and so on, and just.. swap. Yes.
As an advocate for better surgeries I often find myself wishing humans could swap parts more easily. Not just trans folks would benefit.
All the time.
Yesss I would love to donate my male body
Its tall and used to pack a lot of muscle before I decidet to stop the denial
No, I wouldn't wish my permanent unshavable neckbeard on anyone.
All the time, I think science is gettin advanced enough that lab grown organs aren’t too far off. Lab grown weenrs are the only trans application I can rlly think cause as transfem it’s mostly just rearranging and removal cause boobas grow with hormones. Maybe if we got sufficiently advanced we could grow and transplant entire nerve systems/clusters so you could have the same nerve pattern as a natural clitoris. (I haven’t done much research into the specifics so they might already have figured out stuff with nerve restructuring but it just sounds complicated at face value so I assume it is futuristic leaning)
As a MtF ⚧️ Many times... omg to just be a cis on the other side...
I am grateful for the journey, as it is making me stronger as a person, but I would gladly take the better head hair, soft smooth skin and reproductive abilities cramps, boob sweat, that time of month and all...

Dangly bits corse skin and body hair is all yours!

Yeah I know there are other perks n pains, but I think we all know that 

Privilege, strength, how people treat you... the list goes on! 

4 months in on HRT, and counting, we really are amazing people MtF FtM Enby, it takes guts to really be yourself! 

Don't let anyone try and take it from you!

Though I think we all need to come up with names for e
non-binary variant names for sibling, parent, aunt/uncle, grandparent, child, as well as respect names (example Ms.. Mrs. Mr. Mx.) Sir/Ma'am/madam... Mx. Works, but people don't know/use it...

 ⚧️♾❤🏳️‍🌈 best wishes to ya'll
Same here! Like either swap body parts or like remove our heads from our shoulders (head and neck) and swap bodies!
I would 100% to that if it were possible ❤️
Me and my boyfriend are both trans and always talk about what would have happened if we where born in the right bodies
So sweet ❤
Well, it could be possible. Scientists are researching brain transplants. In 1970 a scientist grafted the head and brain of a monkey onto another monkey and the brain actually worked, the monkey was alive and fully functioninal, the monkey died eventually because the body rejected the head but it shows that it is possible. Perhaps in the future mtfs and ftms could do brain transplants and so they could both live in cis bodies. Although I doubt this would be possible within any of our lifetimes.
One day we might see that technology, they can transplant so many other things now!
The problem is that you would have to either somehow use stemcells to change the dna of the genitals or disable the immune system permanetly to make sure the body doesn't reject it.
Brain swaps gotta happen eventually.
So like legos?

***pop***
I could see how that can happen with FtM people and having a penile transplant but I’m unsure how there could be a Vaginal transplant unless you mean like ovaries
Someday they’ll be able to grow a complete set of reproductive organs opposite of your AGAB and keep it in case you find out you’re trans. Since my maternal instinct is kicking my ass these days, this is what I wish for. Now, if you’ll excuse me, ima go cry.
That would be kinda awesome. Especially since my spouse and I are both transitioning at the same time. Really though customizable cybernetic bodies are what they need to work on.
Why not just swap brains lol
B-but... Shakira said... 🥺
I love it 😂
Yessss omg
There's been no success, but there has been some doctors trying to figure out how to do it brain transplant.
I hope you get to meet more people in the community, it's just a nice feeling being round others that understand your struggles
:)
This is me but with AroAce person
you've probably seen multiple but didn't clock them
I'd take it in a heartbeat, got a tatted 5""6 body with the thickest fluffiest hair you could want right here 😂
In under 2 weeks? Amateur, I unfortunately grow one every 12 hours
I honestly wish they could, like even if they could take the parts removed by surgery and give them to others, the same they do with organs
Like I don't want them, but they still work, you take em
That is wholesome, I'm so happy to hear you feel at home in your body 🖤
Honestly, I see so many trans woman wanting to know the feeling of carrying a baby, and I jist wish I could give it to them
And there are so many others that wish they could have it, I wish I could give mine away
I know how you feel, one day, we'll get there :)
I know, there are so many people our there that just hate what we want, life is strange that way
I can only apologize, what I was getting at was the fact that I wish that I could give the parts that I find insufferable to those that actually want them
Just because you're not fond of something, doesn't mean someone else won't be, I don't want mine but I know so many mtf that would :)
It makes you, you!
Yeah, just if hypothetically there was a way, also see you just had top surgery, hope you're healing well ✌🏻
Honestly same, I mean it's not a lot, but same 😂
Take mine, please 😂
That's the dream for me, tbh, just wanna swap away
I know that people have been looking into transplants from cadavers. Apparently it's happened a few times on amab people who've needed the surgery but it might be a viable option for ftm surgery too.
I mean, we can do it with other organs, even hands so I think there is a possibility one day
Stem cells may not be necessary - there are now CRISPR based approaches that let you modify DNA in a wide range of cell types, and particularly in the CAR T-cell field, universal CAR T-cells (i.e, they can be given to any recipient) have become a thing.
In theory i think we could see a brother / sister swap where each is trans, however that is a rare occurrence.
It’s been done. As far as I know the first penis transplant was a success
If you can dream it, you can ~~build~~ swap it
HAPPY CAKE DAY
I know ;-; but my hips trick me into thinking I’m able to go do stuff!!! But then I’m not X3
Problem is its really hard to keep a brain alive outside of a body (probably) for long enough to swap
Lol that’s probably why I like Reddit so much. See people going through what I am and have gone through every day.
It's like seeing a unicorn, I'm always so happy to meet other trans people out in the world, I met Danica Roem, the first openly trans delegate and was so hat I was near tears. 

It feels amazing to know there's a community out here for us,  people that know the struggle, not just empathize with it ( though I love our allies too!) Know the feeling of euphoria that comes with clothes or starting HRT etc. My cis loved ones can only understand so much, and my wife (mtf) understands most of my struggles but it's not exactly the same.
Cool you also get a little bit of male pattern baldness no take backs. Thanks for the hair
If only we were so lucky
I wish I could give you my cock and balls. They are just overrated and a pain in the ass when it comes to shaving
Thanks for being so positive :)
Facts
No it's understandable, It's just that everyone assumes that everyone who is trans is pre op and as a post op woman I feel like we're often forgotten.

Also if people want to swap bodies, then more power to them that's their choice and their body, there's nothing wrong with that.

As for me I like my body and I wouldn't want to switch with anyone in the whole world😊
Exactly
Thanks! Been doing pretty good for the past few weeks. Back to normal movement and everything. Recovery was rough the first couple weeks after surgery, but I'm definitely doing better now.
😤
Win win
I didn't know that! Thank you for the information! :)
Yes but as stated that means permanently disabling the immune system which is quite the hassle to live with. That's why you only do transplants for life saving treatments, because the likelyhood of dying due to disease or infections goes up exponentially without any immunoresponse.
true but unfortunately you'll then have to take immunosuppressive medication daily which lowers the function of the immune system so that it doesnt reject the transplanted organ, for the rest of your life and of course a lower immune system means being more vulnerable to illnesses, plus the medication could have side effects.

^^^*distant ^^^click*
Thanks a lot ~u~ 💕
It just creates that sense of community, even if it is digital :')
I'll take it, no tradebacks 😂
I'm so happy you're comfortable in your skin, one day I hope I am myself
Good to hear man, I've got my first appointment in March, ive finally be able to self fund, and I want top surgery asap, just worried about my recovery
That's what I've been worried about, I'll be having the same procedure, and I'm so scared my nips will just reject or not sit the right way :/
It's still far off. I read one study about it. I'll see if I can find it again.
Thank you for the science explanation! I was a games dev so not my specialty 😅
Yes and the rejection drugs can cost thousands a month.
Even if that wasn’t an issue, removing a body part is an incredibly invasive procedure. Lots of trans people would probably be fine going through it, but some would not. I worry that this would become a point of contention—“you’re not really trans/you’re selfish if you don’t want to have this procedure”! Something to watch out for as medicine progresses
Thank you for the science insight my guy, I come from a game dev background so not my strong suit :')
My step mom got a kidney transplant DURING COVID and refuses to take her own safety seriously, it’s painful to watch. My dad and that whole side of the family is not vaxxed and don’t wear masks around her and they travel all over the place and I’m surprised she hasn’t died yet…
‘Sexy Lego Noise’

Followed by sexy trans noises. 😉
❤❤❤
Congrats on your appointment!! What kind are you planning on getting? Or do you not know yet? I got double incision with a free nipple graft. 

Movement was pretty restricted for the first couple weeks. No putting weight on your arms, no lifting more than 10 lbs, no side or stomach sleeping, no backpacks, no driving, no reaching above your head, etc., but once I got the drains out, most of the pain was gone. 

The most worrying thing for me was how the nipple grafts looked for the first month or so. They looked like they belonged to Frankenstein's monster or something.
[That was easy](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/6754030/)
No problem ^^
Technology that can ""wash"" the DNA from cells but leave the physical structures the DNA has been produced. They can seed the structures with the individuals own DNA for a compatible transplant. I think they are still working with animal models though.
oh yeah hadn't thought of that
I mean, that's already a (rather horrid) thing, see transmedicalists.
I didn't think of that, we are under enough persecution as it is :/
“sexy lego noise”

why
Was just abouta say that. Don’t visit that sub I’ll save y’all the trouble. Imagine if trans ppl were like insanely transphobic and already you’ve got a damn good idea of the general vibe. Basically if your not amab/afab and desperately trying to do everything in your power to hormonally and physically transition to the opposite gender (cause let’s not forget there’s only two genders and the rest are completely invalid/s) then your not trans your just confused/ you have a fetish or are mentally disturbed. The kinds of mental gymnastics you’d have to pull to say “I can trans my gender cause the one I was assigned at birth doesn’t fit but if neither male or female fit you then your mentally disturbed and somehow I’m not” is fucking miles beyond me. I thought terfs pissed me off cause they’re so close to not being scum but tetp (trans exclusionary trans ppl) have taken the pissing contest to a new level my friends. It’s essentially every toxic aspect of the trans community taken to the extreme and given an echo chamber to fester in its own hatred. Awful stuff comrades 😖
Ha can’t sit and right more than 5 words in two hours in class but u sufficiently grind my gears and I’ll write an essay
""Trans Exclusionary Trans People"". I love that phrase, it describes those people *so* well!

Thanks, I need to re-dye it tho. I just ordered a bunch of hair dye and might try purple and pink since the blue doesn't work very well :P
Thank youuu~
I started as soon as I turned 18, so 8 months ago
They were one of the only features I liked about myself when I was presenting male ;D
I need to dye it again soon as well, I might do purple and pink this time tho...
Thank you!!!
thank you omg!!!
You'll get there one day. A lot of it also has to do with internal stuff that I've had to work out. I'm sure you're hot af but just can't see it yourself :)
OMG THANK YOU
I mean tbf I started as soon as I turned 18, and my gender specialist and one of my trans friends have remarked at how unusually fast HRT has worked on me. I'm sure you'll be beautiful AF
I'm so glad, you'll be super cute ;D
You'll get there, I know you will 🥰
Love your.. what would you call just like. A look. You're aura?
Thank you~
It was a gift from my friend when I started coming out 😊
So glad to hear you're happy and I love your hair I can't wait until my hair grows out
That explains it^^ you remind me of my younger cis fem cousin <3
Haha funny that's the only thing I like about myself too oh also I know who I am and I won't let anyone take that away from me
no problemmmmm!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
aww thank you, can only hope lol
Your so sweet
I love you both
I never let my parents cut it when I was kid, I remember getting what I now realize was euphoria when people would accidentally mistake me for a girl as a kid. Turns out they were right ^ - ^
Hell yeah, you go girl!
I mean you look hella cute with faceapp (I don't really have anything else to go off of)

PS. Matching username hehe
Ofc, gotta support my fellow trans folk :D
My parents never let me grow my hair longer than a kind of short surfer cut then they'd cut it really short like a military buzzcut
Yeah I know I'm a strong willed beautiful girl who's as stubborn as a mule oh and I don't take anyone's shit I will be more than happy to use my ""man strength"" to hulk out
I mean all technicalitys am a fresh from egg , so just imaging a baby chiken with a shell still on its head and it looks like a hat but yeah
Well that sounds super cute! Also we've all been there and ik it's helpful to feel comfortable and valid which you definitely deserve!

YAY! My whole day is amazing waking up to this 😍		"Nice! ""female"" is annoying though
Yay! But I'd be wary of anyone who calls someone a ""female"".
validation 🤩
That's that good shit, kicks like a mule
Yass slay queen
thats awesome
Yay. Very good morning to you.
Unless they where a doctor, Or like a Police/someone front he military, referring to someone as female just sounds kind of off to me, But Idk, Maybe just me. 😭
Aw that's great!

Usually I just get ignored or asked about everyone around me lol
I don't get it, you are a girl so that's how it should be done

Now for real, I'm glad that hormones are doing their job 4 u, stay strong queen
People who tell you every euphoria inducing thing they hear abt u >>>
That would make me happy af
This happened to me after being on hormones for a little over a year. Mind you I’m still in “boy” clothes and everything not even presenting female, and still got addressed as a girl.
That's awesome 👏🏳️‍⚧️💞
Aww thats fab ❤ I would take that as a win 😊❤
🙌
That's so wholesome 🥹I needed to see some positivity 🤗 thank you
🥺
Lol yeah 🤷🏻‍♀️ I’ll take the win 

Maybe they were military or police before and it was habit?
Well idk which of her coworkers said it lol. There was a few that might worry me…trying not to overthink it 😅
What’s wrong with female
❤️ absolutely! I feel like I’m finally close
😅 I was in full boymode too so it’s like extra shocking.
Smiling ear to ear today lol 😊
Lol yeah but 🤷🏻‍♀️ I’ll take the W 

Lots of ex military around here
☺️

I’ve been getting odd looks for sure, especially from the older folks. But 🤷🏻‍♀️
🥰 thank you lol

Yes me too. I was so afraid that 38 was too late to start. But I’m now so freaking glad that I did
Very very! It’s been a wild week and needed this lol
Yep that’s what I’ve been doing. I was just in athletic pants and a tshirt/light jacket. My year is in May, can’t wait. It’s like a new birthday 😁
Yes! It’ll be my first time wearing anything fem this weekend too…heart rate is very elevated lol
❤️ me too. My whole day was pretty perfect after that. I’m even in the gym right now for the first time in absolutely forever
A win is a win
That's fair :p I just immediately think incel when they say that instead of woman or whatever
Historically, it was literally used to decategorize black women from white women to remove their autonomy as women, so it's sexist and racist lol
It sounds a bit as if you're a human talking about how the male lion and the female are mating.
Makes you sound like an incel lol
Maybe they just knew hehehe
Hey as long as you feel good that's what matters! It won't happen for me but it's good it's happening to you!!!!
I remember my 1st time giggles it gets easy and 2nd nature after a while xx
Lol! Yeah it’s definitely an odd way of putting it.
I just peeked at your profile. If that’s you…you look like a girl to me. Obviously it’s not in person but like don’t give up hope if it’s what you really want. If that’s you then you’re definitely there.
I'm AFAB, I hate being a woman...
Reddit lovingly won't let me see the comment you made (it shows the notification but it won't load it for some reason), so know you're not an idiot and you're absolutely fine. Everyone misgenders me and my gender is weird so I'm used to it. It's alright, I know I never will pass for what I feel so I really am not mad or anything. It's something I'm just kinda used to at this point. You're good, don't worry!"	11f59f3	trans	1393	0.99	2023-03-01 14:32:46
So I contacted Ikea Canada about their BEYOU/trans pride Blahaj and got a disappointing answer (Happy for all the folks that got one though 💖🏳️‍⚧️)		"Blahaj goes where they are most needed ❤️
Tbh I think its nice that they didnt profit off of it. Feels like more genuine support
It took me so long to understand what BEYOU meant I honestly thought they just misspelled bayou or something
I swear I would sell my soul for a trans Blahaj
I think it would've been kinda cool if they sold a limited amount of them and donated the proceeds to trans charities.

Still, cool that they did it at all. I just really want one haha.
We were this close to greatness! This close!
Watch people start to sell them on eBay for 300 dollars
Perhaps i shall dismember a blåhaj and then trace the pattern and make my own trans blåhaj market /hj
Maybe if enough of us contact Ikea they'll make it an official skew
this is adorable! sucks a lot of people can't get it, but that means those who need it the most will have a comforting shark boy. ♡♡♡
What is Beyou Blahaj?
NOOOOO I CAN'T GET A TRANS BLAHAJ I'M CRYING
They had trans blahaj???!?!?!? 😩😩😩😩
IIRC They were donated to clinics that do GRS to bring comfort to their patients as they are recovering from their surgery
What in God's green earth is beyon blahaj
Here’s a decal you can get: https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1382576156/ikea-shark-blahaj-trans-rights-35-in

Also, you could dress up as one? https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1294134443/shark-hoodie-unisex-super-funny-fashion ;)

There are also patterns on Etsy so you can make your own in the colours of Canadian Blahaj! :)
It's time for a few trans pepole to get filthy rich from reselling those
This is extremely transphobic
Pinkwashing. Id rather have them pay their taxes. Fuck corporates
Damn 😔
i really wish i could have gotten one
Couldn't you dye a blahaj with fabric dye maybe?

Saw people painting their couch, maybe you can do that with a stuffy too.
aw damn, didn’t think it was limited
You can get them from eBay , it’s where I got mine
Hm. Must be popular.
Maybe if we ask enough, they'll do a limited run
it seems harsh, but i'm seriously considering dissassembling my blahaj so i can make a pattern from it.  overstuffed custom-colored blahaj with weighted beans for the win!!
You can buy both pink and blue shark plushies on aliexpress… a half skilled sewer could remove the stuffing and cut both (making sure to leave a seam allowance) and sew the parts together & restuff to make their own for much less than they are going for on ebay. Just a thought….
Godspeed Blahaj
Yeah, I'm glad pride Blahaj is out there making people happy ❤
Yeah I agree, it's disappointing that many are gonna miss out, but it's an act that feels genuine rather than just for clout and profit. I honestly wouldn't mind seeing them sell them and donate part of the profits to trans charities
Agreed
I'm learning Swedish atm and was like ""This doesn't sound like Swedish. I wonder what it means?""
oh. yeah that makes a lot more sense than it being a misspelling of the first half of beautiful

^(i may be stupid <3)
Lol literally just got it while reading this thread

Also thought it was pronounced ""bayou"" 😂
Does it mean Be You? (Asking for a shark friend)
whats blahaj
But what about your soul?
I would pay much more than that
I will buy one if I must.
BAD IDEA DO NOT BOMBARD IKEA 

Better idea make a silly little petition to politely show demand for the trans shark 👍
Btw, (and this is *suuuuper* pedantic) but it’s actually “SKU” which is an acronym for “stock keeping unit”
Ikea made a Blahaj in the colors of the trans flag and gave them to gender clinics. It is a Be You Blahaj. :)
Right!? Why am I always missing out on stuff like this?
Blahaj with trans pride colors. They were only limited time and given away through DMs and possibly to other places (The Halifax Sexual Health Center got donated one)
???
Tbf, I really don't think it's pinkwashing here. Ikea actually did  something with thought behind it, and rather than just donating x amount to y charity, actually designed and created something with at least some thought and care put into it, I'm not pro corporation myself by any means but it does for all intents and purposes seem like a nice gesture, not to mention Ikea as a company has outlined itself as  being pretty progressive for quite some time iirc. 

Also, if they were really pinkwashing, I'm sure they'd actually sell it right off the bat rather than just donating it. However many Blahaj' they send out they're not pricey enough that they're gonna make a dent in a tax filing, you're talking a really miniscule amount of tax being cut overall from this.
Donating plushies with preferred names embroidered to trans folks who dm them, as well as donating said plushies to sexual health/gender affirming health care centers, without charging a cent to anybody, hardly seems like pinkwashing, especially cause it's not like Ikea has any controversy they need distracting from
Selling them for charity would be a good idea too
In Louisiana we pronounce it bye-you
I believe so, lol
Shut up
i could get so many normal blähaj for that much money.
That is a better idea <3
I found it. I had no idea what a blahaj was until now.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blåhaj
Oh it's a Ikea plush toy shark I see, I had to google it 😂
Extremely transphobic that I cannot have one I mean
Their tax avoidance (in EU, im not 100% sure how its handled in the US) is not even about the blahajs tho. Name of the Scheme is Flat Pack. I just have a hard time giving them props for one good deed when they  dismiss their social responsibility of paying taxes
Theyre dismissing their social responsibility of paying taxes in the EU(nit sure about the US). Its a shame that it isnt a controversy. I cant praise them for one good deed.
Sell them, but don’t donate to charity. Put that money towards creating the infrastructure to create even more at a lower price. Then sell them at double the *lower* price, and make it a buy one, donate one type deal.

Of course that’s way over the top, but it’s fun to dream
Ah yes, Louisiana. I fucking hate it here :)
Or you could sell a kidney and get both
Ah! I'm sorry that I didn't explain that Blahaj is a stuffed toy shark from Ikea. I focused too much on the type of Blahaj as the source of confusion, and forgot that someone may not know what a Blahaj is. My apologies, and I'm glad to know you found the info you needed. :)
Haha you got downvoted for not knowing Blahaj
Ok good for a second I thought you were one of those 'Being Bisexual is Transphobic' Types
I think it would help if you elaborated on your frustrations and Ikea's wrongdoing in your initial comment, a simple ""they should be paying their taxes instead"", probably comes off as a little vague to a lot of people, especially as Ikea's tax avoidance is a hardly touched upon subject that a majority of people have no idea about
Yeah...I moved for work...to fucking Oklahoma 😢

I hate it here too
or i just work at ikea and slowly syphon the supply of Blähaj from out the back so i get them free.
I turn 40 next month. You’ll have to forgive us “older folk”.
Blahaj is all powerfull ig 😂
I guess thats fair. Im sorry for letting my frustration through like that. I shouldve known better
*OUCH.* Right now I’m split 50/50 between Shreveport and Alabama where I go to school. Neither are good options lol. I’m hoping I can move to Colorado with my aerospace engineering degree.
UGH. I was born and raised here, and it sucks. We have the worst governor right now.
The underground trans blähaj heist
Indeed, indeed
It's understandable, I think your frustration is valid, it is just difficult for others to understand said frustration when they are uninformed
I went to Louisiana Tech in Ruston for my schooling. I did electrical engineering. Personally, I liked Tech overall even if Ruston is a bit on the smaller side. I just went to Shreveport or Monroe whenever I wanted to do something that wasn't available in Ruston. For example, I went to watch Rent live in Monroe, got my wife's tattoo done in Monroe, and took her pet snake to the vet in Monroe. Loved going to Shreveport for Second and Charles.
Agreed. I've been here for a few years now and our politicians suck floppy donkey dick.
*Insert Payday 2 Planning theme here.*
Oh cool! Lots of my friends went to Tech. My (transmasc) brother’s partner is heavily involved in the Trans Advocacy Group there.
now how will we do the heist split like how everyone argues on gta about how they didn't get 85% of  the pay for 3% of the work 😂
I didn't know there was one there. Would have been nice to know, though, lol. I didn't understand I was trans until about 3 years after college, though, so idk if it would've helped me anyone. I'm happy for them, though, and that there is a group 🥰
Yeah, they’ve been asking me a bunch of questions for TAG about the name change I’m currently going through. Honestly it feels good to be able to help other trans people through my own experience. 

When my egg finally cracked, I had just finished my undergrad program, so I had not been involved with my university’s LGBTQ organization at all. But at least my partner has always been super supportive! (and non-binary and pan lol)"	10foekk	trans	1389	1.0	2023-01-19 01:16:40
WOOOOOOOOO AM SO HAPPY FOR MY FRIEND !!!		"Why are there even waiting lists for HRT? 

Seriously, 2yrs just to start HRT! This just seems soo wrong!
Woah, I had no idea the trans health care in Europe was so slow. I realized I was trans and then a month later was on HRT. US health care sucks major balls, but at least I have access. I can't imagine still waiting for HRT. Thats insane
THATS AWESOME!!!
Are waitlists seriously that long? I know nothing about the full process
[deleted]
That's fucked :/ in Australia there is no wait time - any GP can prescribe HRT with informed consent.
[deleted]
wait by any chance is this in the netherlands
ALSO THATS AMAZING im so happy for them!!!
Glad that we don't have things like waiting lists in Nepal 😬 People don't have procedural barrier to access HRT.
There shouldn’t be a fucking waiting list for HRT that’s bullshit, and could cause suicides. America health care is garbage but at least you don’t have to wait for HRT.
Yaaaaaay!!! That wait is so so brutal
LET'S GOOOOOO
Awesome
There's waiting lists?!? Ah shit :(
fucking amazing man
Wow, good for u.
Hope ur transition is going well 💙💗⚪️💓💙
Amazing 💖
Don’t get me wrong I’m so happy for your friend’s progress and journey and I wish them all the best....but why was her/his waiting time been reduced? Like myself and many other trans people waiting on the GICs list we’ve been waiting 2 or more years to get hrt to me it’s a little unfair
Due to overdemand. I have my intake next summer in the Netherlands. (but I did find an informed consent clinic which should contact me soon)
Just because it’s slow in Netherlands, doesn’t mean it’s just as bad in other countries in Europe :D
I had the same experience! I finally acknowledged I was trans and literally 30 days later I started HRT. I guess that's a big plus to our shitty private healthcare 🤷🏻‍♀️
Yeah in the UK trans healthcare sucks ass, 2-6 year waiting period depending on which GIC you’re attending, and then you have to get two “signatures” (aka 2 different gender doctors saying “I agree to you having this) with the appointments being 1-2 years apart and then another 2 signatures for whatever surgeries you want plus the wait time for surgeon spaces to open up. (I started my doctors journey at 15, didn’t start HRT until 20, they also require you to go through a lot of therapy to “make sure” too)

Always shocks me when people come out and the next week they’re on HRT and a surgery waiting list in the US.
YEAHHH !!!!
Even longer in most cases. 2-3 years in most of the UK and basically never in Northern Ireland.
I have no idea but im happy for her !
Any GP can, but most wont. We all end up going to the same select group of GP’s
Same here in the US...made my decision in July, made an appointment for later that month, hormone test first week of August and hormones the second week. Private healthcare sucks but at least it's care.
Holy shit, I would’ve gone DIY by then. Yikes
Yes it is in the netherlands we are dutch !
Depends on the country, I live in Australia, there's 0 wait time
Thanks i hope her transition goes great to !
I have no idea but am verry happy for her !
Something tells me that the ""overdemand"" is due to manufactured scarcity
fellow dutchie here. really hope i’ll be lucky and be able to start at the end of this year, but maybe corona fucked that up
Overdemand from what bureaus consider 1% of the population?
Oh I didn’t realize this was specifically Netherlands! Sorry sorry! Good point
In Spain it can be worse
That's got nothing to do with private vs public. Here in Argentina we have public healthcare that covers everything from HRT to ffs and bottom surgery and it's also accessible 
by simply announcing that you're trans.
Do you at least get all of that, including surgeries, covered? But man that sounds so so frustrating. I’m sorry 😭
What’s the hold up I. These cases?
[deleted]
omg then mine might be shortened as well!!!!! omg omg omg omg

im signed up for amsterdam umc,,, idk where your friend is (and if y’all are okay sharing that)
oh ok, thanks :)
Kind of. Healthcare in the Netherlands is generally underfunded, but the number of applications at trans health clinics have also risen like 800% in the last 10 years.
It's more like cis people don't care enough to give us access to what we need.
Can add it's like 2 years to meet a gender psychiatrist and then another year as a test period, which then you can get those magic pills.
Don’t worry about it :)
now that's what I call health Care
Yup! NHS is free as we pay taxes our whole lives, but a lot of people will go private which costs mega £££ to try and get round the ridiculous wait times.
In the UK trans healthcare is given low priority and is underfunded

I hope so for you !
Still though. All I had to do was tell my doctor, ""hey I'm trans! And I have a therapist."" and I was given a new gp who prescribed them a couple of weeks later.

Sure I still had to pay for my meds and the visits, but it was way easier than I expected it to be out here, even living in Portland, OR.
I know. My point was it is routed in transphobia. There is no reason anyone should wait or be hindered from receiving their hormones.
I'm very jealous lol
Yeah, healthcare in the U.S. works well for those that have the money to afford it. Fortunately HRT isn't to expensive and I was able to get my prescription after a couple weeks.
Yeah, I think because if where I live I've definitely had a better and easier experience than most Americans. In the south it would be way harder to get on the ol titty skittles, but here I not only did that, but I got full coverage for electrolysis and top surgery only 4 months after being put on the waiting list. Corona actually helped with the latter because all elective and cosmetic surgeries were canceled to keep the hospitals more open, but emergency and medically necessary surgeries were still scheduled. I also got it for free because I qualified for medical financial assistance when my ability to work was severely impacted by the pandemic.
Yeah, I've BARELY been able to pay for it even with a subsidized plan through Obamacare. There have been weeks I had to cut my doses to make it last until I could afford the copay. Yay America."	ik0bzo	trans	1365	1.0	2020-08-31 15:42:41

I appreciate you and that you exist.	Then you might think to yourself why would this random stranger appreciate me, she doesn't even know who I am, heck I don't even know who I am, but I do appreciate you and I'm super grateful that you are here still reading this, supporting others, getting help, or just existing, I know life is pretty damn hard, but look at you, your here you are spreading love and happiness on this wonderful subreddit. I also appreciate the fact that your trying to find out who you are, for your own sake, not bc of a friend, loved one or family, your doing this for you and your happiness, and I truly 🐝🍃 in you and your journey, you can do it I know so.	"I may have needed to hear this...
I want to hug you...
i appreciate you saying that, and you as a whole, thank you
I'm so grateful for everyone who came before me. They paved the way for me to be comfortable enough to come out. <3
I have made it a habit of telling random people in public that I appreciate them or to have a blessed day or so on. It's amazing how people's faces light up. Feels very good and it all comes back to you. You truly do reap what you sow. 

Have a blessed day everyone! ✌ + ❤
If people can hate for no reason I can love for no reason.

“I used to think I was the strangest person in the world but then I thought there are so many people in the world, there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways I do. I would imagine her, and imagine that she must be out there thinking of me, too. Well, I hope that if you are out there and read this and know that, yes, it’s true I’m here, and I’m just as strange as you.“ F.K.

Happy Pride Month to me lol :') my dad had a Facebook meltdown about me being trans, TW for his transphobia and a TON of misgendering/deadnaming. It's time to block		"**Context:**

I'm 25 and I moved to a new state last year to start HRT and also just cause I wanted to. My two older siblings stopped talking to my dad like 1-2 years ago. I still was mostly because I was living under his roof at the time. I am not any longer. Ive posted about my dad a couple times here. This will hopefully be the last time.

I shared one of those posts about men at pride who give dad hugs and how sad it is to be able to sob in the arms of a stranger bc your dad won't accept you. My dad texted me saying he assumed that was about him and that it was ridiculous. I should go see him asap. I was at work when he texted me this

Not 10 mins later he commented on a photo I was TAGGED in. So as I'm sure many of you know, the person who posted that photo also got notified of this whole thing, and I feel really bad for her. The pic was me at age 6 on Halloween. My mom commented about how cute it was 8wks ago when it was posted. My dad commented all the stuff in the screenshots lol I guess because he needed to publicly be an ass? He sure loves to air out personal shit too in front of an audience 🙄 he is definitely a narcissist. 

And he's over half a year late to this reaction. He pretended to support me for quite a while. Now he's showing his true colors. I suspected this from the very beginning. Hopefully no one will, but on the off chance someone questions me, yes I have shown him plenty of grace and sent him countless resources and been nothing but kind and patient with him. but he was a shitty father to my not (out) queer siblings and they hate him too so 🤷🏼‍♂️

He also recently commented on a selfie of me looking buff being like ""oh you're just like these buff WOMEN!!"" like seriously fuck him fr it's just so shitty and disrespectful

And lastly: GOD BLESS MY SISTER!!!! 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏 I'm so thankful to have her back me up like that 😭❤️ I was a little worried how she would handle me being trans for a while so it's nice to see her defend me this way ❤️


**In case anyone gets confused:**
Red = my dad

Blue = my sister

White = a former classmate from our school whose like 5 yr older than me. They don't know me well but defended me nonetheless

Green = my other sibling

Purple = my deadname. My real name is Bucky. I blocked out my last name in one of the comments w purple. 

Maya is a family dog who sadly passed away at an old age in a shelter because my sister was unable to support her for extremely valid reasons. It was not a kill shelter, she just died naturally. My sister thought she was going to live longer than she did.

**EDIT: Hi friends I just logged on and had 55 notifs from this post! I'm at work but I'm going to read and reply to all of them eventually. I skimmed a bunch and I feel a lot of love** ❤️

**I wanted to let you all know I blocked my dad on Facebook and I blocked his phone number. I don't think he knows how to find me elsewhere, but I locked my twitter account for the time being just for peace of mind. My sister said this morning that HE blocked HER before she was able to again (Facebook makes you wait 48 hrs to reblock) so idk if that means he noticed me blocking him or what. The only way he'd be able to contact me now is by mailing a letter. On the off chance that he does, he'll likely write my deadname. In which case I can return it to the sender for ""no such name"" at my address :-)**
Sister is an absolute Champion, the dad sucks. Got myself a similar thing in that level!
It's kinda like his answer is in his own transphobia... perhaps trans people are at a higher risk of attempting and/or committing suicide because their own parents don't love them as they are and/or identify but instead berate them with how ""wrong"" their life is, hmmm?!?!
When will people learn.  That 41% statistic was 1. Attempts, not successful suicides, and 2. was whether the person was out or not.  We get suicidal because of a bigoted society, not because we transitioned.  I am part of that statistic.  That's why I came out.  Transition saved my life.
Gotta love it when people think they can speak for you. ""[Deadname] never wanted to be a boy"" like okay buddy

Sorry to hear your dad is a bigoted POS :( it's great that you have your sister at your side though. Stay strong Bucky 🙏
the suicide rate is so high because of transphobia tell me what that mf is on cause i fucking want some

edit: i just got to the second page so i didn’t see that the point was brought up during the conversation
I’m truly sorry your dad is like this Bucky, it’s disgusting how parents can be like this. I’ve had similar experiences with family but I can’t say I understand how you feel, all I can honestly say is that I sympathize with you and if you ever need someone to talk to I’ll do everything I can to respond as frequently as possible. My inbox is always open, especially to a brother like you. I hope your dad will eventually learn so you can see eye to eye before he’s gone and I hope you have a good day.
~~hey man...uh...u left ur deadname in that last pic i think. idk if it bothers u or not but thought id memtion it~~

nvm read ur other comment lol, maya is a cute name for a dog
lol what a loser. sounds like you guys should block him and deny him the satisfaction. it's amazing how these people think they know who we are more than we do even when we never fucking talk to them. I had a grandpa like this guy and believe me I fucking WISH my mother had not let him see me. that man fucked up so much of my life. your sister is doing the right thing keeping their kid from him.
Yeah I'm absolutely never telling my family I'm trans
I'm so glad you've got someone in your life who is unconditionally supportive of you. 

That looks like it hurt a lot, and I'm pretty sure that you know that you're not responsible for making him see the light, but I'm saying it just the same because sometimes you just need to see it. Sometimes parents cannot sacrifice their own comfort- emotional, psychological, whatever- for their kids, at the end of the day. It's not your fault, this isn't your damage that is causing him to act like this. Your dad is exhibiting a lot of anxiety controlling behaviors- he needs help but not from you. I hope he gets it and gets some healing and can come back to you in a respectful and supportive way.
Your sister rocks. I'm so sorry that your dad is giving you such a hard time.
[removed]
... okay, I actually have nothing nice to say about your dad so I'll just say... god, I am so sorry you had to deal with this. What a horrible way for him to talk about his son... I hope you can heal from this soon, I'm very glad you have a truly loving sister, and I wish you a fulfilling life with people who love and see you for who you are.
Your dad doesn’t seem to realize that the suicide rate is only higher for those who are NOT accepted by family. Like Jfc
No offense but your dad kinda sucks
What he neglects to realize is that the reason for a high suicide rate, is due to people like him. And that behavior and mentality such as his, is harmful. Especially from a parent towards their trans child. But, there's plenty of people who love, support, and are very proud of you; like your sister.
This is so painful to read. Parents should love their kids and want them to be happy. I understand this too. My Dad has not been very accepting. He said some hurtful stuff like he is praying for God to ""fix"" me and many other things. I hope my Dad comes around and I hope yours does too.
Bruuuuh, he told your sister “you dont even have the balls-“ 💀💀💀 The cognitive dissonance is strong in him… sorry you’ve had to deal with that kind of disappointment. Definitely the right move to throw the block and start and new chapter without him.
And why does he think the suicide rate is so high? Unaccepting, bigoted family members contribute to that 🙄
Da hecc? He's so rude-   


I'm glad you're following your heart. Congrats on getting away from him lmao
That's something else. Your dad's bigoty has alienated him from all 3 of his children? I mean, I'm shaking my head at this for the dumbassery of it all, but I kind of feel sorry for him when he's older, lonely AF, and realizes that this attitude quite literally cost him his whole family. I hope he figures his shit out before it's too late, if it isn't already.
Situations like this, knowing that suicide rates are high due to bigotry, and what your dad is doing (he needs true hell for what he's doing, I'm glad you are blocking him), make me feel like a traitor to the community because due to being a pansexual enby who has supportive queer parents, I cannot relate well.

Bucky, I would like to award your sister for her vigilance in supporting you against this awful dad of yours. I like that my trans female friend is herself, and I like that you are you, just as I like that Ralsei of Deltarune is Ralsei!
I'm sorry you had to experience this but on the bright side you have lots of people who support you it seems
So sorry this happened to you. I can relate except my situation is the opposite— my sister is the righteous one that has been victimized by my transness and my parents are enjoying getting to know me as their youngest daughter. It’s hard because I basically learned everything about being a girl from quietly observing my sister for 18 years. 

Here’s a warm hug for you….*hug*
Transphobes always leave out the part in that suicide stat that it's for UNSUPPORTED trans people
He's creating the environment that causes us to kill ourselves and then saying I told you so when it happens
My god he’s such a hypocrite. Fuck him. Good luck to you dude! He doesn’t deserve to be in your life.
I’m glad you at least have your siblings that support you, my two younger sisters treat me like a freak.
Ah yes, voicing concern about suicidal people while saying \*exactly\* the sort of shit that exacerbates trans people's suicidal ideation.

How ""lovely"".  


I'm sorry you have to read things like this, especially from a family member. Stay strong.
Yea.. that will fix it
This is the type of person whom I'd like to nominate for a line of mugs and other chachkas with the phrases ""No 1 deadbeat dad!""

And ""ohhkay Boomer""
I humbly agree, having someone like him in your life can be very... bad. And what your father said is honestly awful, hopefully he turns around to reflect but he is in way to deep to where he doesnt understand that trans suicide rates are due to unsupportive people like him. Stay strong and be comfortable with yourself man. Its good that your siblings are there for you, they seem like great people.

And Honestly I feel this on a personal level, ive told a few family members that im cutting off everyone in the family when I leave(Family talks about shooting any lgbt+ people on sight so coming out or staying around them is... like feeling like a sheep in wolves clothing, in a wolves den).

Anyway, stay safe, stay hydrated, stay prideful.
People like you are the reason its so high 💀
“They protect their children from harm”, proceeds to cause immense harm.
r/confidentlyincorrect

Yikes. He’s got a case of conditional love. You deserve so much better OP.
it baffles me how people can be so dumb
Nice to meet you Bucky, glad to see you're living your true self. Hopefully he will leave you alone at the very least and quit trying to make it seem like you're dead. He's a disgusting man, and that is coming from a registered republican who used to think along similar roads as him. It took me a bit to realize at the end of the day that I was the problem even if I wasn't vocal about my disliking and just did it silently, love you for you. Don't let anyone try and make you feel bad about it
-sigh- a true parent should love their children unconditionally and ur so called dad has failed to do so and even tho that parents should protect their children from getting hurt but it is also true that they have no right to tell who u r only u decide that and 4 what it is all worth u r a very handsome man
On the first picture I was going to say that even if your father is a biggot you should still aim to mend your relationship with him. a lot of our folks from the previous generation came from a different, less open and less tolerate world and really do want the best for us. As misguided as they may be - but - upon reading further, I see you have a sibling which also cut contact with him and your father really is persistent in his ignorance so I’m not sure anymore. Do what makes you happy and live your life but please don’t view your father as a villain.. just a fool maybe. Hope he changes his mind and ways as the time goes. For the time being focus on yourself and enjoy your new freedom
[removed]
Your dad sounds eerily like my mom… 

funny because even though she tries to argue that I killed her daughter, she never lost anything, she just gained a son. I’m a man and a woman lmao
Hey OP: Your dad sucks
Lol i hate my parents
Ew.
Glad your siblings are looking after each other. Absolutely incredible how people who claim to preach love are so filled with hate and ignorance. Not shocking, just impressive and kind of sad.
“Actions that have more than a 50% suicide rate.”

I fucking wonder why
OP, I'm incredibly sorry, but also, incredibly happy for you living your life as your true self I'm still working on figuring out who I am, and...it's hard. Feel like there's no one I can talk to sometimes. I'm glad your support system is as strong as it is.

Also...have to say, the donor for half of your genes (Mot calling that man a father. None of what we're seeing here is fatherly behavior.) has to be the poster child for contradicting himself multiple times within his own comment. Yikes.
I can't fathom ever treating your child or family like that. So fucked up :(
Gosh, I would want to send the last reply to that transphobe so much!
Lmao, as if that guys grandchild will miss not being able to see a fuckhead like him.

Also, hilarious to see him sign off with “you don’t know me >>>:( !!!” after just claiming to know everything about someone.
This breaks my heart. Bucky, your dad wishes he could be even half the man you are. We love you brother
I feel like if it’s FTM dad is sad, if MTF dad is angry
SO tired of shitty fucking unsupportive parents. I’m so sorry. Thank god you have a wonderful sister!
Bucky, I'm so happy you got your sister and people around you who supports you! I hope where you're living now is much better and allowing you to be your true self 💜

I'm sorry about your dad tho, he definitely sounds like....a mouthful. And reading the part ""parents don't tell you everything"" is just so stupid like?? Sure but kids don't tell their parents everything either. And for valid reasons that he clearly don't understand.
You are a KING, Bucky. Don’t you EVER forget that!
Drop him like a hot potato. Congrats on being you ❤️
Big thumbs up for your sis. 👍🏽👍🏽
Aren't those rates hes on about more a problem for people who are forced to not come out and he them selves?
Your dad seems like he's deep in denial and refuses to accept yourself being happier than you used to be in the past. You have no obligation to fulfill what he wants because he just thinks about himself, and doing so would make you unhappy. He's egoistic and manipulative, and him being left by his family members was self-inflicted, but he doesn't want to admit that, as it's easier to shift blame on someone else.

His mention of suicide rates is completely off, and it's related to the opposite thing - because of people refusing to accept trans folks, or worse, disowning them.

Also good job to your sister for calling his bullshit out, glad to have parts of the family that are supportive. At this point cutting him off from everything is the best you can do, you don't owe him anything and it's his fault that he's ended like that.
Are you ok?
But... It doesn't havea suicide rate that high? That dude is a fucking idiot.
Ah yes I remember when I realized I was trans and instantly became 50% suicidal because that's obviously how that works lol
Your father want you to commit suicide like many of us.

Ps: It's 40% of trans people have suicidal ideas in their lifetime, his stat are from right wing websites.
This makes me so fucking angry. His only argument is the 50% suicide rate. If he‘d only realize that he’s the reason for it being so high.
""50% suicide rate"" yeah well mabye if you and alot of other shit heads supported your child then those numbers would drop?, It just boils my blood when people use that as an excuse
Your sister and her classmate are awesome people, sorry about your dad
""part of a movement with a 50% suicide chance""
First: As if it was your choice to be trans
Second: He's one of the reasons why people kill themselves. Parents have so much influence on their kids and when they try to force their son to live as a girl, they don't even realize how much they harm their child.
The cognitive dissonance is astronomically strong in this one. Like bro, you're the cause of the 41% suicide rate. The words you are speaking, are literally the cause.
Proud of you bro
Old people really can't handle their social media. Sorry.
this happens to me too :(
“3 of my kids/ all of my kids aren’t speaking to me anymore I have done nothing to cause this”

I’m glad your other family members support you! Best of luck on your journey !
Do... Do we have the same dad? 

But, seriously, I feel ya.
r/insaneparents
I'm so sorry.

I'm so glad your sister and the friend stuck up for you.

I am a great proponent for burning bridges with family that let you down, but I'm sad for you that it's necessary.

This mum of a trans girl is sending you love and hugs 💖
Yikes, I'm sorry your dad was such a cunt. But you don't need people like that in your life and you will find plenty of respect and love from other people as long as you love yourself. Take care comrade
Hey Bucky,

That hurt ME to read and it’s about you. I’m so sorry that he is that way. How ignorant of him. He’s using twisted facts (like the suicide rate ) and right wing extremist and TERF talking points so jumbled, it’s obvious he doesn’t even understand them. 

I think you’re better off without him in your life. I know some parents need some time to mourn our other selves, but it’s all in the intent. And this clearly isn’t a case of misgendering you by habit or accident. He’s trying to play a victim role to get sympathy and support. 

The bright spot in all this is the defense of you by your sister. I was so happy to read the added post that you have supportive people in your life.  Keep the people who show you love. Life is too short for the other kind of person
I'm too chickenshit to actually read most of what your dad said, but your sister sounds like an awesome person 💜
Parents experiencing grief in the beginning is a common thing, especially when it's dads about their ""daughters"". But man, your dad's an ignorant asshole beyond repair. You're really better off blocking him. You have the greatest sister though, so I'm glad you still have family to rely on. Good luck, my man <3
slide 2 they really said “find god”😂😂
🤐
W sister
A parent doesn't fail when they have a trans kid. A parent fails when they don't SUPPORT a trans kid. Much love and support to you as you walk your authentic path, dude!!! 🥰
Sometimes the hardest thing is disassociating yourself with awful people you’ve known your whole life. Just remember, there are always people out there that love you for you.
I'm really glad you have a sister like that. Especially with a dad like that
i'm tired of people saying that there's a high suicide rate while they're actively telling you that you're horrible and you're not trans. like it's absolutely awful like seriously you're helping those rates go up by being such an awful person about it. 
sorry i ranted about that it just really reeeeaaaallllyyyyy makes me mad
Thats not a parent that's a bully
""You wouldn't encourage them into behaviour with over a 50% suicide rate""

Actually braindead words right there
thats my parents im 17
no offence, your dad's a piece of shit
Block him! He is toxic to you! I have had to remove people from my life because of crap like this including family and the longer you leave it the more toxic they get. The rest of your family are supportive and are in your corner and god bless them for that but it won’t stop him pushing his agenda but in the end he will not know the real you and will miss out on you and that is something he will never get back. ❤️ this is just my thoughts and off my experience. Much love to you ❤️
I don't get how people like them can't see that the reason the s-word rate is so high for trans people is because of people exactly like them not being accepting  of their own children, it takes a huge emotional toll and I wish they could see that
Holy shit. I'm sorry, Bucky. My mom is cut from this cloth and I don't wish it on anyone. I hope you're happy despite the harrasment. And yes, definitely time to block, I think.
The only reason we have a high suicide rate is cause if people like him that try to repress us
Honestly alot of your dad's comments echo the same toxic sentiments my family have been gas lighting me with since I came out in february.

You have absolutely wonderful siblings, and clearly they surround themselves with equally wonderful people. 

Def. Time to block. You got this bro- cut that negativity out of your life.
[removed]
I do agree 💯
I wonder why the suicide rates are high… 🙄
This is always the attitude of the people on the political right: “how this affects ME”. Zero consideration that this is a human being’s entire life being discussed, we don’t want to minorly inconvenience them worth our own personal fulfilling. Lol
I'm so sorry.
""Parents don't tell their children everything"" ""that's not my child you don't know [him] I know everything about [him]""

Bro seriously needs to read up on the word ""hypocrisy"" because damn.
OP, my sister in arms and/or knighthood, with all due respect, your dad seems like a tool.
w siblings L father
The way he used the suicide statistic to help him pisses me off so much
he's beyond horrible. i'm so sorry bucky.
Damn what a hissy fit from dad, I'm sorry you had to deal with him.
Glad you have people backing you up on this.
Also just want to say, love your name.
Good on you for sticking to your ground. I’m glad that at least someone is in your corner. ☺️
r/insaneparents
I have something verry similar with my family ""we like you"" ""we respect"" and ""we just think thoses things shouldn't exist"" yhea i see that they are REALLY loving when they say thoses thing, or my father saying to my face that i am an abomination and later saye that he likes me and ""what are you doing to us""
*puts hands together in prayer fashion, moved to lips. Inhales, then exhales before pointing hands to you while still together*

Please don't take offense to this, because it is completely out of love for you:

That person is not your father. I don't care if I'm a trans-woman, I will be your father now, and I couldn't be any prouder of you and your amazing sister. And if anyone gives you shit, point me in the right direction and I will still go ""papa bear"" on them, because you deserve love and support, even if I don't fit the mold to be a ""father figure"". 😊

Be true to you; I'm proud of you.
Listen to me, it looks very very bad now, terrible, and listen to me you still have worth man. You are a man just like everyone else. You’re perfect the way you are and it’s going to be hard for a little bit but he WILL possibly come around (mine did) but don’t sit and twiddle ur thumbs and try to convince him. If your sister is in your corner appreciate it but don’t use her to feel happy again, put your head down and put focus into becoming the best version of urself and chasing any goals and dreams you have. It’ll be okay
Wow, I’m so sorry OP. Fuck that man, he’s not your dad he’s a sperm donor and that’s all… I’m glad your siblings have your back
Wat a prick
Sorry your dads being a jerk. I’m glad to see some stand up for you though! Hope your day is good.
I about to have a very “civil” conversation with you dad (by civil I mean I’m gonna yell at him for a good 2 hours until he gets it into his head that he’s so fucking wrong)
I love the casual“you need Jesus”
You’re not under *any* obligation to put up with that sort of shit, you don’t owe him “grace”, nor do you owe him education. That’s shit he needs to work o it on his own.

You owe yourself protection for yourself.

I’m sorry - you deserve better.
I love you. I'm glad you're here. Happy pride month.
So sorry you have to go through this! Sounds like your dad just wants to stay ignorant to have something to be mad about, if he truly cared about you he'd educate himself on trans people as much as possible. It's really sad this is so common, the way he acts is literally why so many trans people can't ever be themselves.

As another trans guy (closeted to family because homophobia), absolute condolences to you my dude.
So true. I'm sorry you're going through something similar. On one hand, he makes it easy to justify cutting him out. On the other, it took me 3 days to gather the emotional strength to even read any of what he said, and it hurts 🤕
 I KNOW RIGHT. He brings it up like 2 or 3 times and someone even pointed this out to him and he still somehow doesn't get it lmfao it's so weird how people like him genuinely think being trans dooms you to suicide lmao 

I'm not even inclined to do that and have never given my parents a reason to think so. Back in highschool when I knew something was wrong mentally, I asked me parents to take me to the docs and therapy. So they know I advocate for my own mental health. Now the reason I want to go to therapy again is to specifically work on issues my dad has caused. Very ironic lol but he wouldn't understand since ofc he is so perfect and knows me so well
I have a very conservative neighbor. She asks me questions about my son a lot- it might seem weird to some but she's friendly and has never treated my son with anything but respect, she's just reallly conservative. I welcome her questions because I kind of feel like if I can help educate people that's the least I can do to help out. 

This topic came up and I told her to think that through- ostracizing trans kids just when they really need their parents might be a reason more than the decision to be who they are. I think I gave her something to think about.
Not just whether they're out or not, but whether or not they even *know* at the time. I didn't figure it out until the week before my 34th birthday, but if I had tried to take my life in the decades of dysphoria and depression before then I'd STILL be counted as part of that now.

I'm so sorry you had to go through that but I'm glad you made it out the other side
They think you just turn trans the moment you ""do the voluntary decision to switch your gender"" because of boredom, satanic advertising is something, because

mY cHiLd WaS nOt BoRn ThIs WaY, oh you mean these signs? Solved them with beatings
Also, I read from a study somewhere that using your child/ a trans person's pronouns and name (not deadname or old pronouns), DRASTICALLY decreases the rate of suicide. Hang on, I'll pull it [the link to the study] up if I can.
Exactly!! People would not feel so inclined if they lived in a society where they were loved, accepted, and respected. Would people still attempt and commit suicide? Of course, but it would definitely be far less, and it wouldn't be because they chose to transition. 

I'm happy you're still here and able to transition ❤️❤️ I hope things are better for you 🫂
That genuinely made me laugh. I never wanted to be a boy so bad I started T last year 😩🤣🤣 

Thank you 💕🫂🫂
Like, hell, I didn't want to be non-binary when I was younger cause of internalized enbyphobia. But here I am. Whether you WANTED to be who you are now when you were younger doesn't matter. I WANTED to be a dragon or named Rainbow. Now I want to be authentic and happy. Shit changes. And people need to get over this.
Haha no worries! He ignored it anyway 🤦🏼‍♂️ of course. Ignore all the valid points and just keep spewing crap. 

The scary part is my dad is vehemently against any drugs or alcohol. He is just sober all the time and thinks like this 😭😂😂😂😂
Ah thank you so much 🥺❤️ I really appreciate this 💕 I wish this wasn't a frequent experience for us 😔 I'll keep your offer in mind 💞
No worries!! I appreciate pointing it out just in case ❤️ she was a husky and the goodest dog 🥺
I totally agree. Her kid is only 3 years old so she will not be damaged by never knowing her maternal grandfather. My mom is with a really great guy now AND my niece has a great paternal grandfather so she will not miss out or resent my sister for anything. 

And seriously the way he kept insisting he ""knows"" me is so funny. He tried to say that on the phone before too, that he knows me better than anyone. It's laughably untrue. My dad has not had a single interest in my personal life, my thoughts or beliefs in..EVER. when I was a little kid I talked to my dad all the time but he would get annoyed and say I talk way too much. So I stopped 🤷🏼‍♂️ I became my own person without him and now he's mad he's been left out 🙄 mf did it to himself!!

My sister actually UNblocked my dad so she could defend me 😂 she had to wait 48 hrs but she is gonna block him again. I plan to as well

I'm sorry youve been hurt by a paternal figure as well 😔🫂
If nothing else, I'd definitely recommend moving far away from them if it's at all possible. I'm not sure how old you are. I have way more peace of mind knowing I'm a 5 hour drive away from my dad knowing he will never put that much effort into driving that far to Do Something
Thank you so much 🥺❤️❤️❤️ I actually have panic disorder that I inherited from my dad. He has been on the same meds for like decades and they probably aren't doing it for him. He has major mood swings and has always been an incredibly angry person that needs to be in constant control. I wish he would seek therapy, but he's nearing 60 and I just don't see him ever resigning to it :/ either way, I'm going to separate myself from him for the time being but this does hurt me a LOT more than I'd like it to. 

And even though I know it, thank you for saying it isn't my fault 😭 I didn't respond to any of these comments and yet I still feel I need to personally apologize to the op for his behavior even though I didn't say a single thing to him to inspire this.
She does! And thank u 🥺
So tru 💪😤
Thank u sm 🥺🥺🫂 dw a lot of my friends have been saying a lot of Not So Nice Things about my dad 😂 and they have been long before I came out as trans. He just really Sucks. I always knew this was going to end up as the breaking point for me. It felt different when he still didn't know who the real me was. Now I can see he is always to reject all of me, and that sucks.


That being said, I'm actually REALLY thankful I wasnt born cis. I can't imagine what type of person I would be if my dad raised me as a boy and his only son 😬
Idk if you read them but someone mentions it in the screenshots and he just flat out ignores it but then brings up the (not even accurate) statistic again 😑
He does and u can be offensive about it 😂
Yes you're very correct. I have a lot of wonderful and amazing friends as well. This does pain me, but in my case I don't feel driven to any type of self harm. I just like putting my dad on blast as a means to cope LMAO I have tried to explain the reasons for several trans statistics but they all just go in one ear and out the other 😑
I'm sorry to hear that 😔 I wish this wasn't a common experience for us 🫂
LMAO OMG YOURE RIGHT I didn't even think about that! 😂😂😂😂😂 

It will be such a huge relief tbh my dad has been a constant stressful looming presence I just can't have hanging over me anymore
Thanks!! When I initially came out he was like... Completely fine with it. And for a hot minute I DID think maybe I did overreact? Cause I spent YEARS mentally preparing for the inevitable fall out and even joked I wouldn't know what to do if he didn't disown me lol 

Now it almost feels like he did that JUST to gas light me long term. Cause my dad for most of my life has constantly berated me for being too sensitive, angry and constantly over reacting 🙄
It was all for uniquely different reasons too 😭 My dad is like conspiracy theorist Republican, like, I'm sure you know what I mean. 

My sister is very much a centrist, so I was actually a bit worried she might not fully accept me. I was really shocked and touched by what she said here. My sister doesn't really comment or get offended by my dad's views, she just hates him for being a shitty dad, which is valid. 

My oldest sibling, however, cut my dad off because he picked a fight (on Facebook lol) over politics during the George Floyd protests. 

For me this was all worthy of cutting him off but I'm kinda glad he gave me a good reason. I was too afraid to just randomly block him out of fear of what he'd say or do but he made it easy here. He is delusional but I have to think on some level he can't possibly think after saying all this that I would be like ""oh haha dear old dad! I'll come visit next week!""? Like ??? C'mon bro. 

Sorry if this is TMI or anything. I keep word vomiting in the comments. You can probably tell I'm just trying to justify myself 😅 this whole situation just really sucks.
Ah don't think yourself as a traitor! You just happen to be really lucky and that's a good thing I'm happy for 🙂 it's saddening to see how many people relate to this post so it's actually comforting to know there's someone who doesn't but cares nonetheless. We are all in this together no matter what ❤️ thank you for this comment 💞
MAN im sorry dear 🫂 in our case I'm glad we have at least SOME family on our side ❤️
The ""I told you so"" is more important to those people than the actual lives of their children because then they get to be right and get to be the victim.
LEGIT he's such a fucking weirdo honestly
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm sorry to hear that:( many hugs 🫂
For real 🙄🙄 thank u 💖
Oh same to you 🥺💕 please stay safe 🫂 That sounds really scary 😔

I am very lucky for all the people and things I do have. This is a struggle but as far as being trans, I'm actually very happy and confident. I just have bad anxiety but I'll be getting help soon
IKR 😭 and the bit about ""protecting them from themselves"" I am 25 goddamn years old. I am a whole ass adult who is free to do whatever I please. It's not like I'm a 3 year old sticking my fingers in electrical sockets. He can't control my actions forever 🙄
Thank you 🤧💕
Thank you so much for saying this ❤️❤️ I really appreciate it 🥺 and it's lovely to meet you too 💞
Thank you 🥺 ur absolutely right. Protecting me doesn't mean denying my own identity 😑
Uhm absolutely the fuck not. They didn’t just disappear when the world progressed they actively made the choice to continue to be horrible “people”. Seriously where the fuck did you get the audacity to say shit like this.

His father is a bad person, and that’s a fact.
Yes, both my older siblings have severed contact with my dad and neither of them are LGBT like me. My sister who commented is married to a man with her own kid and lives a very traditional life and even shares some of my dad's political views. He is just simply a bad father whose always emotionally berated us and our mom. He wasnt physically abusive...much. he always blamed it on his own bad upbringing and insisted allowing us to live in his home and eat his food meant he was a good dad. But there is so much more to being a good parent than being a provider. We needed a father who loved us unconditionally, taught us things, and supported us. He just didn't do that. 

It just happens for me that this is my final straw, but I'm not severing contact purely because he doesn't accept me being trans. However I still think that's a valid reason anyway because I do not want to spend the rest of my life constantly justifying my own existence to my parent
There is no old me I'm still the same. I just go by a different name and pronouns. My personality is still the same, which is what my dad should love me for
I agree. And I'm glad my siblings and I have stuck together against our dad instead of letting him turn us against each other. It makes cutting him off easier knowing I'm not the only one
IKR I don't think he rereads any comment or text he's ever sent, or thought it through 😭

I'm happy your exploring yourself but I'm sorry it doesn't feel like you can talk to anyone. I know it may seem hard but there are some wonderful people online who can really help give support 💗 my online spaces contributed a LOT to me realizing I'm trans and wanted to start HRT. Stay strong ❤️🫂🫂🫂
I can't understand it either 😔 this isn't the first time Ive been genuinely at a loss bc of something horrible my dad said or did to me. But hopefully this will be the very last time
You mean my sister's? It was a really good reply haha
Ajsjhwb ethank you sm 🥺🥺😭💓💕💞💗💖🫂
Same here dude. I'm very thankful for my sister too 💕
I KNOW RIGHT I honestly don't know what point he was trying to make there?? 😂😂 It sounded like he was saying he purposely withholds info and makes stuff up but it's only right when HE does it. Idfk tho lmao 

And ty, I'm living in a very progressive state/area now and am called Bucky and he/him at work by everyone :) I actually think there is a trans femme person at my new job bc she told me her pronouns were she/they and asked mine too. It's so awesome to have this be a new normal for me ❤️
HELL YEAH 💪🤴🏼 ty 💞
Thank you for saying this ❤️❤️ at times like these its genuinely helpful to have so many people validate my feelings and help free me from the guilt I feel for blocking him. Next step is therapy lmfao 😂💕
Im doing better now with all this mind blowing support ❤️ ty for asking
LMAO YEAH I love how he chose a higher scarier sounding number lol what if im the 50% who ISNT suicidal? 🤨 What then ?? 🧐
I have SO MANY icky memories from childhood about my parents saying and doing things that made me extremely uncomfortable but felt like I couldn't say anything. Im realizing now many of my sorta ""core"" memories were moments were I felt dysphoric. In my dad's mind, because I never told them about all these feelings that meant I just never had them

I will genuinely never understand how you can have such little interest in a person and then suddenly claim to know all their thoughts and feelings and going as far as calling them a liar when those feelings are voiced 🙄
My favorite part was when he said me moving away for my SAFETY was actually me knowing what I'm doing is wrong and that I'm embarrassed 🙃 like yeah ur right I'm embarrassed to be related to such a bigot 😂
🥺🤧💓💖💕💞
It's crazy how they aren't embarrassed to say stuff like this in front of everyone they know lmao
I'm so sorry :( much love and hugs 🫂🫂
He's so dumb fr 😂😂 thank you!! 💕
Oof big hugs cause it's ROUGH:( 🫂🫂🫂
Thank you sm mum 🥺🫂💖💖
Thank you for this comment 💖💖

I can confidently say that he has been recently getting deep into the Republican narrative against trans people with a touch of TERF. He suddenly started using their very specific language, such as texting one of my friends that I was ""mutilating"" myself. He definitely wouldn't have said that if he didn't read it somewhere. 

And yes, this isn't a case of me being annoyed by small things. I have answer every question he's had and assured him to HIS satisfaction that I thought this through and nothing huge was permanent with HRT that I didn't absolutely want. I haven't even CONSULTED about ANY surgery so it's not even like I just got top surgery and he's sad cause my tits are gone lol 

I've also sent him a TON of resources and gave him the benefit of the doubt by saying myself he was just having a hard time. But then of course this confirmed he is a victim so I kinda regret but also I don't because I can block him knowing EYE did everything the way Republicans and TERFs say I should, by being nothing but kind. I didn't want there to be a chance of a legitimate claim that I was being that angry trans person who cuts off the head of anyone that misgenders him haha

This is not to say that people are wrong for their feelings, I'm just a people pleaser and I just try to be nice. I'm not always nice tho haha anyways this is a long comment AJAJSJS I have a hard time staying concise on reddit because I'm always compensating for the fact that no one will know or remember me between posts 😂😂 I'm so not used to this haha
That's totally fair please take care of yourself ❤️❤️ I myself didn't read all his comments for a few days. The only reason I did was keep my resolve about blocking him tbh. But I was very happy to read what my sister said 🥺
LMAO YEAH!! also how convenient for my dad to say he has Jesus and Jesus agrees with him LMFAO funny because my mom was the religious one who always took us to church. My dad ain't never went!! Mf is the one going to hell here 🤣
EXACTLY! Thank you so much you're a sweetheart 🌸❤️
Me too 💗
It's ok!! You are very justified in feeling that way! It's a super annoying talking point they ALWAYS default to. I wonder what statistics I could pull up for lonely old angry white men dying young and alone 🤔😂😂  seriously though. You can make anything sound bad with statistics, especially if you never bother to think of their implications. It's a weakass argument but people are still falling for it. It's VERY frustrating
RIGHT 😭 like any trans person has ever gotten on hrt and surrounded themselves with love and support and went ""this is the very thing that makes me want to die"" lmfao my dad has -10 braincells
I'm sorry to hear that:( I hope you are able to find a safe space when you are a bit older ❤️❤️🫂🫂
Thank you sm!! ❤️ I actually did block him on FB and his phone number as well 👍 he doesn't really have any other way to contact me but I suspect I will be hearing about things via family members. We'll see how that goes. Bless u and much love to you as well 🫂
Same. It kinda sucks he ignored the person who pointed this out to him in the screenshots 😔 but he has always flat out ignores valid arguments
MAN sorry your mom sucks too 😭 this is tough but I did block and I'm still very happy with the person I've become :-) big hugs from me to u 🫂
I did it!! I blocked FB and phone number last night. Thank you for offering me strength 💪 I'm sorry this is happening to you. I hope things get better for you and you find peace 🫂
Nah my dad ain't respecting me so I'm not gonna respect him 🤷🏼‍♂️
LMAO IKR they are always so selfish ""but what about ME 🥺"" it's especially ridiculous considering my father put in 0 effort to be an active presence in my life. It's not as if we had a super loving and close relationship before this
IKR he doesn't make any sense 😂 honestly a lot of his comment I was just going 🤨 HUH??
He definitely is
Same 🙄 I hate knowing me coming out as trans just says ""I'm suicidal"" to some people because I am not!
Aw thank you!! 🥺❤️ I love my name too and it's really cool to have a bunch of people commenting with it 💕💕
Me too 🥺
Ajsjdjeje this is very cute and precious and made me smile a lot 🥺🥰🥰🥰🥰 thank you so much for saying this for real :') ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Thank you!! 🥺❤️
> nor do you owe him education.

I'd say if a friend or family member genuinely cares about you and is just grossly misinformed but trying to learn in good faith, by all means help them learn before they end up ""learning"" from dubious sources. But if someone goes off the rails on a transphobic tirade, fuck them.
You are right and I appreciate it ❤️ I have a tendency to show way too much patience and care for people who dont deserve it haha and a lot of that is because of the way I had to act to keep my dad from getting angry at me. So I have a hard time not translating that online *especially* reddit I feel like I really have to over explain myself so people are mean to me or something lmao ik it's dumb/pointless cause they will be mean anyway
I love u too 🥺🥺❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🤍
Much love to you 🫂

I've sent him Sooo many resources including links, YouTube videos and mercury stardust's tiktoks (I love her 💖) And Im pretty sure he didn't read or watch any of them:/ or if he did, he consumed it in bad faith. 

I was closeted for a very long time before it was safe for me. My dad doing this confirmed I was right to follow my gut and wait until it was safe. I hope you also come to that point soon 💞
I been seeing my folks less and less intentionally. Hearing them is exhausting. It's a mood.

Seems familiar 🤔
https://news.utexas.edu/2018/03/30/name-use-matters-for-transgender-youths-mental-health/ (study link)

""Researchers[Study](https://news.utexas.edu/2018/03/30/name-use-matters-for-transgender-youths-mental-health/) interviewed transgender youths ages 15 to 21 and asked whether young people could use their chosen name at school, home, work and with friends. Compared with peers who could not use their chosen name in any context, young people who could use their name in all four areas experienced 71 percent fewer symptoms of severe depression, a 34 percent decrease in reported thoughts of suicide and a 65 percent decrease in suicidal attempts.""

""[Earlier research](https://cns.utexas.edu/news/victimization-of-transgender-youths-linked-to-suicidal-thoughts-substance-abuse) by Russell found that transgender youths report having suicidal thoughts at nearly twice the rate of their peers, with about 1 out of 3 transgender youths reporting considering suicide. In the new study, having even one context in which a chosen name could be used was associated with a 29 percent decrease in suicidal thoughts. The researchers controlled for personal characteristics and social support.""

So if you don't want your trans child to commit unalive, use their pronouns and new name. Don't deadname.
yeah transphobes ignore anything that don’t go along with their beliefs. i think there was a study where homophobia and transphobia was often linked with low intelligence
I hope the frequency of it lessens as your father grows. I’ll be here if you need to talk, that’s a promise
Old habits die hard- the OP in your post may be more worried about you than themselves.  I don't think you need to apologize, but maybe reach out and say 'I see this really sucked for your perfectly innocent thread. I just want to check in and make sure we're okay."" or something like that.

My dad is very similar and while he's undiagnosed I'm certain he has depression and anxiety issues- all of his kids do, whether or not we were raised with him. When my son became my son, my dad insisted on confusing comfort with respect. As a result he's not in our lives anymore. My dad had a pretty rough upbringing, but he's an adult now and deserves the consequences of his actions in all things, just like yours does. You're not the one making things difficult. Keep your chin up- you're going to get the last laugh here.

&#x200B;

Edited to add- Sorry, you didn't ask for advice- old habits die hard for me too. I'll leave it there, I don't believe in erasing mistakes so much as learning from them.
You're welcome I get it my parents don't get me either. They deal with me but they don't fully support me use name pronouns so it's a pain in the ass.
Oh yes hugs are nice 🫂
HA! Well as far as trans perks go, that's definitely is pretty high up there! Maybe that was a way for the universe to be kind to you. :)
Yeah, I didn’t realize there was more than one 😂
You have a good head on your shoulders. Keep doing what you do King 💜
So do I. If you ever need someone to talk to feel free to message
Yeah, tbh he sounds like an emotional liability—the kind of person who you keep attached simply to give them the opportunity to prove they arent shitty or prove they can change, and in the end its just excuse after excuse, holding your breath until the next disappointment… it is better to go ahead and shut it down now. He has made his priorities crystal clear, and that is that his kids are not among them.
People are horrible.
You have nothing you *need* to justify, and your dad has nothing he *can* justify. This whole thing he has created is both sad and tragic. I'm just sorry you have to deal with it. No parent should treat their child like this.
Exactly this. My dad has ALWAYS had the ""I'm always right and the victim"" mentality my whole life 🙄 he wants to predict bad things happening to his children in hopes that WHEN they do, we'll go ""you were right dad!:/"" Idk how I can tell him he's right if I'm dead tho LMAO ig he thinks my demise is inevitable and my siblings will come crawling back  to him. It's never going to happen though. If I end up dead it will be because of something out of my control
Well, its great that your getting help, and that you're happy with yourself. I am personally happy with myself as well, being Aro/Ace/Agender. But the friends I have are probably the only good thing outside of my ownself. But thanks for the well wishings, it means a lot.
I don’t know who he thinks he is telling you that you “never wanted to be a boy” as if it’s a choice. I don’t know what’s up with him, but he needs to get his brain checked or something cause he’s completely brain dead.
No problem my fellow dude bro, we're all made in God's image and this is you fulfilling that image, not making some arbitrary choice like the prick your stuck calling a father seems to think. And whether you believe in God or not isn't important to me, but thats how I feel about all LGBTQIA+ people living out as their true selves. If you're happy, then you're fulfilling God's image of you. Continue to be the awesome, handsome guy you are, and much love from me to you!
Thanks for defending me ❤️ he genuinely is a bad person like, beyond these screenshots.
First off, chill. Second off that’s quite the black/white way of seeing things. Nobody wakes up and goes “hehe time to be evil today”, everyone has their points of view and misguided notions about the world, my father is also a biggot but I understand where he comes from, an extremely religious and primitive upbringing. Nobody is perfect and rarely people are 100% in control of themselves and their thoughts and so I’ve been working with him for years and surely enough he opens up more as time goes because before all he simply acts the way he does out of concern and love. Showing zero empathy like you are now is no better than the way OP’s father acts in my opinion. Only love and understanding will lead to love and understanding.
I can understand and relate. I have a similar experience- you do what’s best for you. I do hope your father develop his senses one day and make amends

Stay strong, I believe in you ❤️

It's not easy 😔
I mean to your dad... from me :)

I just didn't want to point out directaly, that he's your dad.
Im here and ill help when I can 💗
No that's impossible, obviously every single trans person has a 50/50 chance of committing suicide no matter what xD

I agree, this is definitely not a case of being annoyed by small things. You’ve gone above and beyond. I mean texting your friends to complain about you? He honestly believes that he’s going to recruit them and turn them against you? Bucky, as a parent of two grown people. I would never dream of that. I love my kids unconditionally, and all I want for them is to be happy. It’s horrifying that he would do this. I see the hurt in your post. You’re justified in how you feel. 

When one told me they were Bi, I hugged them and told them to find whoever made them happy. I said that there’s not enough love in this world, and that however they decided to share that love was going to make the world better. It didn’t matter if they got married or not, had one significant other or several. I would always love and support them. 

You’ve tried. You really have. But his actions are wrong. It shouldn’t matter what you’ve done medically. He doesn’t have the right to make your decisions for your body. Which the republican narrative tries to assert. Their narrative needs to really re-examine their hypocrisy…They screamed you don’t have the right to make me wear a mask, but they can’t possibly move fast enough to try and block healthcare for women or transgender youth. These are the people who scream what about the children, but with the school shootings go out of their way to defend their guns instead of the children. 

I’m rather long winded here also. You have my support, and I guess I could have just said that. But I hope you know, that by my long response that I believe that you have done everything you could. And it’s now time to stop allowing him to hurt you. But my final word is you’ve already proven yourself a better human, and a better man than he ever was or ever will be. Go and let yourself enjoy this life. It’s too short to allow him to drag you down into his swamp of misery.
Exactly
❤️❤️❤️
It just supports their persecution complex
I just realized that I meant brother in arms and in knight hood, I might not have half a braincell.
Even then you don't owe them anything. It's a good thing and nice to educate them, but they're not entitled to a trans person, be it a friend, family member or stranger, explaining anything to them. It's okay to not have the energy to explain things. It's okay to set a boundary because it would be re-traumatising to have to explain why the things they say or think are wrong. It's okay to not want to put up with it. Offering education to those willing to learn is great, but it's not mandatory. You don't **owe** it to them
Good vs bad faith was actually the main thing I brought up with each of my parents. All I asked of them was to just listen to me and ask questions *in good faith.* I did try really really hard and did a lot of research FOR my dad and sent him all the links. He just ignored all of it. Plus he has always asked questions in bad faith. My answers never mattered to him because he already made up his mind 😔

And I'm confident in this because my mom was really upset with me at first but she maintains good faith and has even started educating her own peers. My dad would NEVER
I totally get that. I tend to do the same, myself - it’s taken me a long time to recognise that the way my parents treated me wasn’t okay, and that I needed better boundaries
I also love your username. I assume it's IASIP related?
It's honestly really sad they don't even bother reading scientifically proven articles. Just really proves that some people would rather hate people than try to be a better person. You're pretty damn strong to be able to put up with your literal dad treating you like this!

&#x200B;

Thanks! Probably won't be able to come out until I'm over 18, but sadly I know they won't support me (but probably won't disown me, at least before I take t) so I'll have to figure out how to get a t prescription myself :').
Luckily I moved to a state where none of my family lives, so I don't see them often. My dad claims I did that cause I'm embarrassed. Yah embarrassed of how bigoted y'all are 😂😂😂
Don't worry about it haha I appreciate your insight a lot 🥺❤️ I didn't even pay attention to your flair at first hwheje its nice to know there are cis parents here looking out for us, for me 🥺🥺🥺💕
My mom has been slow to get there but she's getting there. I don't expect my extended family to ever get it though. Maybe when I get top surgery and grow a beard they'll feel awkward enough but who knows. they don't seem to take it seriously
That's what I chose to believe tbh 🥺 I probably would have been an asshole for a while and would've had a really strained relationship with my older siblings. My dad is very misogynist but he would say ""old fashioned"" but I also would have been gay AF so who knows what would have happened tbh. I am still going to view it as a kindness because I think I've grown up to be a good person 👉👈
Thank u cutie 🥺💕
Thank you ❤️🌺
You're right. Ive been doing the holding my breath until the next disappointment for too many years to wait any longer. Every single family member whose known my dad since before I was born all agree...he will NEVER change.
Thank you for your kind words 🥺💕💕🫂
Also because it's not like I grew up saying ""I never want to be a boy!"" ?? 😂😂 My dad legit would get worried if I cut my hair too short or dress like a boy. Now he wanna pretend like I've been an ultra femme womanly woman all along 🙄😂
Thanks for being so respectful and kind :-) I am no longer religious but I respect your views and am happy to know you believe in something so wonderful 💞
It’s the least I can do, I know what you mean. You deserve infinitely better, and don’t let assholes like that get to you. You, and you alone, can decide if something is bad enough.
These people constantly harm others. They don’t deserve empathy. 

And really, because I make the true statement that bigots are evil, I’m *no better than them*? Lmao shut the fuck up. Queer people didn’t just appear all of a sudden. We have always existed.

Bigotry exists out of lack of empathy and a refusal to learn, not the inability. “Love and understanding” is bullshit. These people want us dead, there is no love and certainly no understanding. “Yeah I get it you think I’m an abomination and want me dead, that’s valid, but maybe don’t do that?”.

If we continue to be weak against these “people” we’ll never be free. No progress has ever been achieved by kindly asking your oppressors to please stop. Being nice to them does nothing more than limit our progress to actual freedom. 

I hope you become a good person and deconstruct the bigotry you clearly have left in you from your upbringing
I see you've commented on my post several times but they keep getting deleted. Are you my dad? Lmao if you're not I suggest to stop being so obsessed with me and leave me alone ❤️
Lmao what, I hope you come back to reality one day, if not, I’ll be enjoying the fact you will suffer endlessly in the next life <3
Ohh gotcha!
OHH right right that 50/50 shot 🤣
🥺🥺🥺🥺 I'm actually really happy for your lengthy reply ❤️❤️ you're a really lovely person 💕 I'm glad other people can see I've put in the effort. it just helps to be validated and reminded I'm doing the right thing

You're a wonderful parent your kids are very lucky to have you 🙂💗💞
Haha no worries!
Yes!! 🥰
Thank you 🥺

I'm not sure where you live ofc but luckily resources like the trans reddits are great ways to figure out where and how to get your T. Some US states do informed consent so it's a matter of talking to a doctor and having them write your script. I myself have been using plume until I can find a doc who will write my scripts instead of the plume service
Heh yeah I finally figured out how to set my flair.. A LOT of the early posts I posted in this subreddit are ""Hi there, I'm a (cis) mom to a (trans) son"" ha ha

And you're totally worth looking out for. Buy your sister a drink (coffee, adult beverages, a soda, whatever) next time you see her, she's a keeper. And if you need parental perspective, feel free to send me a dm, or whatever it is the kids call it these days. Christ I'm old.. :D
Yeah it's the opposite for me it's like the less people knew me pre coming out the easier it is for them the longer they knew me before it's like brutal. I'm in my 30s. So I'm kinda like eh this is what it is they can't stop me and I can't change them.
You're welcome 😊💜
Of course ❤️🫂
I don’t know who he thinks he is saying “this isn’t your true self” like dude, yes it is. Since when does he get to make the decisions on who your true self is? Anyways, go tell your dad to suck a fat cock. (Hope you don’t take offense to that)
We should all be kind and respectful at the bare minimum, regardless of our views on the subject, hell that's what the Bible teaches us, but people have twisted and perverted its words to fit their ideas. Hopefully one day religion as a whole can go back to what it should've always been. A loving accepting home for those in need of one. But I digress and end my rant. And since I'm unsure if you have heard this recently. I love you man. You are loved.
Jesus to the holy Christ. There isn’t enough time in the day to unpack all of this and you don’t seem open to discussion at the moment so I’ll just say this few things. these “people” are our friends and family - normal people, not a KKK-style clan of biggots. They aren’t cordinated in their stupidity. Instead of aiming for a war with them you should aim to help them understand. There is such a thing as blunt education when things go too far but here we are in 2022 - where being ourselves becomes more celebrated with each passing day thanks to the hard work of countless people who acted kindly and intellectually through years of hardship out in the real world, not thanks to angry people arguing on social networks. 2, hate and anger only leads to more hate and anger which you seem to be full of. I don’t know your story or circumstances but you don’t know mine either and what I’ve been through. But I’ll tell you as someone who was surrounded by hatred their entire life and still is - just writing people off as evil is the simple way out. Aiming for mutual understanding is not ״bigotry from my upbringing”. It’s a strength I’ve acquired because of it. I don’t categorize myself as a “good person” and I don’t aim to be one because such thing doesn’t exist. You’ll do good things in your life and bad things, the goal is to be our best self we can be.
Marry me.
Np!

Thank you so much! That really helps a lot! I'll look up the guidelines for my state right now!
Thank you sm 💞💞 I really appreciate it and will keep it in mind 🥺💕
Thank you 🥺❤️ I'm case you haven't heard it either you are loved too! 💕
Alright so you just don’t actually care about change. They’ve had their entire lives to learn, they haven’t, that’s on them.

And there certainly is a thing as a good person, but I’m glad you recognize you aren’t one.

May the Gods help the people around you
OKAY! 😍💍💒
The fact you categorize me as a bad person because my opinion is different than you even though we both aim for the same goal speaks volume. You are being extremely mean but again I don’t know what’s behind your words so I won’t retaliate. You also don’t seem 
to even care about what I’m saying so communication is meaningless - I wish you a wonderful day, week, year and life my friend. I hope you find peace
Done. No take backsies.
You’re defending bigots and telling someone not to blame their abusive family for being abusive. That makes you a bad person.
Where did I do either of those things?

Happy day of visibility		"Oh wauw is it already day of visibility again,.. Just wanna say like your giant flag, but love your energy even more
THOSE SOCKS! They are so cute!!!
Girl u so pretty!
Wow, you’re adorable
Your hair, shirt, socks, it's all so cute. I want that
Looking amazing and fabulous 💖
Wait is it 31st of March or First of April? I’m confused here
Congrats!
It is very visible
You fuckin go for it. 


Hold your flag high and be proud of the woman you are! 🖖
Ah! Your shirt and hair 🥺🥺🥺😊
Omg, you’re so cute!
You look so happy 😊
You are beautiful
Awwww!!!  I’m in love with how cute you are!!!  I’m a photographer and would love 📸 you

Thanks!! It literally had me dancing for two hours in the freezing rain with my thighs out
Aren’t they??? 🌈 🌈
Thank you so much!!
Aww thank you!!
I got *very* lucky thrifting. I’ve had this outfit in mind since january
Aw thank you!!
It’s March 31st is day of visibility. I just posted with mere minutes to spare yesterday
Haha thanks!
My work here is done then :)
I had several moments yesterday where I was out walking in the streets of my town, flag blowing in the wind, held high for everyone to see!!
This outfit had been in the works for two months, and I managed to get it all for free
Thank you so much!!💜💜
I’d say I’m pretty happy 😊
You are beautiful!!
Careful now, don’t think too hard or you might hurt yourself 🥰
Lol you literally edited this from “there’s only one gender”. Clearly you know what you’re talking about
Expect gender is identity and it’s the bodies that don’t match which is what HRT is for
Awww it's so sweet you're celebrating that much with all of us, but please take care of yourself and don't get sick form something avoidable
>Aww thank you!!

You're welcome!
That's incredible

Lesson learned! Good thing I preemptively called out of work tomorrow
Did you realize that gender and sex are two different things? Like your physiology has no affect on your behaviors or interests? Het University in Belgium did some fun studies on that back in the 90s. 

Cute that you ran out of shit so fast you had to find a strawman in my dad.
She is a girl
Sounds like a freecard to do all kinds of wrekless things... Use it wisely}} +++<3

I follow r/trans r/mtf and r/ftm and ive been seeing some weird discourse lately	No space is going to be perfectly inclusive to everybody. Its tough okay. Im seeing trans women complaining about trans men. Trans men complaining about trans women. Its a bit disheartening so im just here to say that this trans girl loves you. This girl wants you to be happy. This girl wants you to feel included. This girl wants you to have safe spaces. Some of you may not know what im talking about and some will, im not gonna bother getting into it. But can we please just spread love and positivity? We have far bigger problems. I will literally suffocate yall in love if we cant behave. 💜💜💜💜	"Trans guy here, I don’t exactly know what’s going on but I’ve seen some of the posts. I’ve avoided them because they stress me out. While addressing problems that come from within the community is important, this type of infighting is seldom productive. 

Thank you for your support!
As a trans woman, I just wanna say, we all shouldn’t be fighting each other, we are in the same community, we should be fighting together. We all are trans and we should be united
Hmm... interesting that I'm not the only one noticing an increase in that kind of stuff... 

I wonder if it's trolls trying to create dissent between us.

We have to stick together and lift each other up.
Yeah I saw a post about it in the r/ftm  so I Lurked into the r/mtf to see what it was about. I mean overall hate on both Sides. Think it’s really sad. I think both have it hard in different parts. At the end of the day we are all under the same umbrella and should respect eachother as such.
There's been a big rise in complaining about inclusivity of various kinds on lgbt subs lately I've found. I don't know whether it's because of a loosely coordinated attack or just people feeling emboldened to make their own posts when they see them so they proliferate naturally. Either way it's concerning.
we may have some completely different experiences, but we also share a lot of them too. just remember that we're all struggling in one way or another and we have to stick together and treat each other with love and kindness. spread positivity, we all need it right now. stay safe out there everybody, love y'all :)
I am a parent of a mtf teenager and the only reason I joined r/trans is to support each and every one of you. To love each and every one of you. And possibly offer any advice from my perspective. Let's love like no one's business! Love you all ❤️.
Wow.  I don't know what's up with the algorithm driving my feed.  I've been seeing the opposite the last few days (anecdotal at best, I know), with trans men coming over to r/MtF and making the most wholesome supportive posts.  At least one claimed to be inspired by a trans woman making a post in r/FtM.  Am I just seeing the corrective response from that discourse?
I once lurked over on the FTM sub and still do, I posted about a really nice experience I had with a trans man and wanted to show my support to them all as a community. I was feeling particularly poetic and posted the following.

We are two carriages passing in the night in opposite directions. Our goals may be in opposing directions, but we travel the same road to get there. We keep it safe and maintain together.

I still believe this firmly. Our greatest strength is our community. Regardless of which direction we are going in, we are always stronger together.
I finished reading this post and all these wonderful comments so far and just love this community so much. I was bragging about it to the only person I am out to so far so this post is also so timely as everything that comes to me through these subs always are. An extended thank you to everyone here.  ☺️
Yeah definitely. I used to follow the ftm sub but after there was a post about trans women shouldn’t be there that I just unjoined and never went back. I would like to just share knowledge so we all can benefit rather than being told like I don’t belong. Im not ftm so i get it and usually stay silent but theres still things I could help with and I like helping.
Sad to hear this. In my everyday life I experience a huge solidarity between all the different identities under the trans umbrella.
Discourse in queer spaces is par for the course unfortunately.  Racist gay men, TERF lesbians, white queers not taking action in DEI initiatives etc.
It's nothing new, although it may be new to reddit. As a bi guy, I have been told by gay men that I'm not allowed to go to gay bars, shouldn't be on grindr, and apparently offended someone I thought liked me just for also liking women.

It's not everyone, and hell, it's probably next to no one overall, but it's enough people to make it annoying. The problem is that they are loud, and noticeable
I don't like this divide. As a trans woman I definitely support you guys on your journey no matter what. It's hard no matter what
yeah, there seems to be a lot going on at the moment... i can't speak for the transfem subs, but in the ftm subs there's been a fair bit of talk about transfems invalidating us. though even more recently there's also been an influx of transfems coming onto the ftm sub to either support or learn abiut transmascs, so kudos to them? but yeah. i've seen a lot of trans women saying stuff like ""T is poison"" in joint trans spaces, which is pretty invalidating for us trans men, which means trans men are pissed and complain, escalate escalate escalate and boom, we're arguing about who has it worse again. also trans men annoyed that many joint spaces are predominantly filled with transfems (which isn't really anyone's fault, but it is a tad disappointing for ftm folks).

anyways, we should really just all be friends and respect each other. neither of us have it better or worse. we each have our own unique issues, as well as a few overlapping ones, and we just need to be supportive of each other.
It was a surprise to me to see when I joined the ftm sub. It's what lead me to look around at other trans communities. 

Trans solidarity is really important to me, so I'm happy to see this post :) I think it's vital for us to support each other where we can, there's already so many forces working against us.
I find it both disturbing and highly hypocritical that marginalised groups such as these after being discriminated against by the masses, are discriminating against each other.

They should all fucking *know better.*

Now fucking stick together, the real enemy is the Giant Space Lizard in Buckingham palace
I think a lot of FtM guys are annoyed that there’s less of them being represented here (maybe less of them on here altogether, which would cause less representation), and then MtF girls are annoyed that they’re getting blamed for it.

That’s my theory anyway lol, might not be true.
The second trans civil war billions of lives will be lost and in the end it will be for nothing
Yeah idk it's kinda weird and I honestly have made a point of completely avoiding it because it seems like a bunch of useless inflammatory bullshit
Lol basically r/honesttransgender in a nutshell, just a bunch of bitter people complaining.
I think it's because trans women 1) outnumber trans men on Reddit by a lot and 2) get so much media attention outside of the trans community, that our own community has started to mimic it. 

Idk when this was coined but I think the whole TME (trans misogyny excluded) think has something to do with it. The idea that trans women face a specific type of misogyny that no one else can relate to. When you pick it apart trans masc people can actually have similar problems, but mentioning that is interpreted as ""a man trying to talk over women"". 

Like I had trans women trying to convince me that ALL AFAB people have privilege over ALL trans women.... Virtue signaling is a bigger problem in progressive spaces in general.

In general, marginalized groups deal with a lot of trauma and I think have a tendency to retraumatize ourselves online. So there is a lot of anger and sad emotions that end up getting targeted at each other..

Another thing from a trans guy specifically: ""Feminist"" spaces have a general ""men/testosterone is bad; men = oppressor"" sentiment that came make it feel like trans men don't belong. Sometimes its jokes from bi women about how ALL women are amazing all the time, but they only like two men (bc men are gross) or jokes about men being stupid or grouping all men together to express any grievance with the patriarchy. It's hard for me to find it funny when I had to work so hard at accepting myself for who I am.

Edit: There was also a thing on Twitter about non-binary AFABs trying to ""impersonate"" trans women for attention because they were gnc. A lot of stuff going on on the internet... Trans ppl aren't even close to being a monolith so this infighting isn't surprising.
I straight up left /ftm I got sick of seeing 80 posts of people asking the same question. It frustrated tf out of me so I left. I found another trans sub and yeah there are people asking the same questions but it’s maybe two or three posts
I have also noticed this, and it makes me sad and concerned. We need to be supporting each other, full stop. I support you all, I love you all.
Be cool if we could just have valid criticism without devolving into shit-throwing contests. Not sure trying to be ONLY positive really works either, but trying to call out someone else’s transphobia while being openly transphobic to them is very unproductive.
it’s annoying asf to be honest. the disparity between transmasc and transfemme presence exists in every single online space and yet it is NOT representative of how irl lgbt spaces function and how transmascs and transfemmes are treated. we need solidarity and strength now more than ever
Cannot stand these posts either because they act like ""trans women mostly populate reddit"" is the same as ""piece of media has exclusively trans women"" and call it ""representation"". Like. No. This is not how it works jfc, people existing in their spaces is not fucking representation, it's existing. 

I understand people feel left out and ig it sucks but holy shit can they stop taking it out on everyone else it's annoying
I have no idea what’s happening, but I just want trans women and men, non-binary people, and those without labels to know that I love you all and wish you luck on your journey. 

You are all amazing people with so much potential. Don’t give up, you’ve got this. <3
I second this post, even when i did not see anything you describe myself.
I left the r/ftm group about a month ago because the transmisogynistic commentary was so constant.
Really happy to see that I agree with all the comments, it’s sad to see discourse and I personally find it really sad since these are literally communities and although we don’t have to get along 100% of the time I hate seeing in these subreddits in particular
Not sure why it has been popping up so much recently, and it's a bit concerning. /srs The mods on the ftm sub made a post about that, so it should resolve itself slowly but surely everywhere, I hope. Apart from the fact that some of those posts may have malicious intent, I did see some transmascs feeling a bit forgotten in shared spaces sometimes, so please do ""suffocate"" us in love from time to time ahah /jk I'm sending virtual hugs to everyone. Please take care of your mental health everyone, I've felt a bit down because of this the past few days. /gen *Hugs* edit : i had put a cute hugging emoji but reddit doesn't like it... :'( imagine very cute hugs <3
why would i argue with/complain about trans women when i could just kiss them instead
At a low level, it's hard for me to empathize directly with trans guys because I can't understand why someone would *want* to be more masculine. But, at a high level, it totally makes sense that different people want different things, and I can certainly empathize and understand why someone would want to change their body. I share in the excitement whenever I see a trans guy post about how flat his chest is, or how deep his voice is getting, or when his beard starts growing, because I know how it felt for me when the opposite happened!

Trans guys and transmasc enbies, just know that this trans girl loves you so much 💙💙💙💙💙
The only thing I've seen in ftm stuff recently is a lot of trans fem keep posting in masc spaces usually trying to be supportive which is kinda weird but whatever and the stuff that had been going on for a while with like mixed spaces being weird and the people who don't like nb and gnc trans people. Am I missing something?
What I’ve been seeing is that many on /ftm feel left out in trans spaces because they’re largely mostly mtf. And a lot of trans men feel like we’re forgotten and mistreated in all-inclusive trans spaces which is why many are protective of ftm spaces. I’ve seen posts talking about how a few ftm people have had experiences in the main trans subs of them being told that they have it easy because they’re ftm and not mtf and such. I’m not sure if this is the discourse you’re talking about, but as someone in the ftm sub I just wanna say that o think a lot of trans men just want a space to talk about their experiences with others who experience the same
I've been reading a lot from both sides and it's honestly all kind of petty, but some valid points are brought up.

In all of the big trans subs, it's mostly transfem posts, which is great for transfem people, but transmasc people often feel left out, and I don't think that's for a lack of posting on the part of the transmascs. Transfem memes seem to be more popular and upvoted in general. Whenever I post a transmasc meme to r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns I tend to get way fewer upvotes than something that's more generalized, and then on those posts I get way more comments from transfem people. Fem and general posts are way more interacted with, and tend to dominate general subs, and that's not the fault of either side, it's more that transfem voices tend to be stronger in group places, and in public. As a trans man I often feel talked over, or not thought of by the general public because a lot of people assume trans women are the only kind of trans person. The number of times I've heard trans men being asked if they were just coming out as feminine when they had been transitioning into a man for years is a lot.

I'm not going to act like the ""T is poison"" posts aren't harmful, but I can definitely understand why transfems would feel that way about it. But the thing is, even cis women have testosterone in their system, just as cis men have some estrogen. It's about levels and balance, if you don't have both it's not healthy. Medically speaking, it doesn't make sense to say that it's poison, you just have the incorrect balance. With part of my transition, I'm opting to keep my ovaries because I don't want to have to start taking E to keep my hormones in balance.

And of course, the biggest issue with shared trans spaces is one person's transition could easily trigger dysphoria in another, but we have to understand that everyone is taking their own journey to help themselves and not make other people comfortable. I'm a trans man, but I'm also GNC, which could definitely make some transfem people uncomfortable, but I shouldn't have to change what makes me happy. And I wouldn't expect anyone else to change for my personal comfort either.

I think the easiest solution is to spoiler certain kinds of posts that could possibly trigger dysphoria for people. Think about others in general and be kind, we're all in the same fight together.
I haven’t noticed… but I also want to spread love and love everyone! I guess I’ve been missing a lot of post
Geez that's not cool. I just don't get how the hell anyone could do that to someone who's going through the meat grinder. It's the one thing that should not tear ppl apart with all the madness outside the community. This in fighting will only lead to a chaotic end to the community and each other.
What can you do when you have two sets of genders each going to the other, seeking a new life in the comfort of the other genders' freedoms?

Perfect place to see some friction.

I see issues with all folks, and in turn, I am sure I am missing a lot of info, but ultimately we can all get along.
If having TERF lesbian parents has taught me anything. It’s that we need to stick together and call out BS when it’s present.
I feel like this happens every couple of months on Reddit at this point
As a trans girl that haven't seen any of this posts: this attitude that you're describing is very hurtful for the community as a whole.

We are threatened day and night by other people, our unity and love for each other is what makes us strong.

Don't fight my brothers, sisters and siblings, we have to be all together and united to maintain our strength and our community.

I don't know anyone here, but I love you all.
This is very odd, I haven't noticed any of this happening, tbf it's been a while since I've been in those subs. As a trans girl dating a trans man, I hope it goes away soon, and to anyone feeling bad about this, I'm sorry it's happening and I love you all 💖💝💖💝
Well, I love you too!
I love my trans sisters and non-binary siblings! There's no need for hate. I'm transmasc and I do understand that sometimes you wanna talk about man stuff, but there's no need to put anyone else down in the process.

I know there's some frustration with feeling ""outnumbered"" in the FTM community but that shouldn't spell hostility. We're all here together, and everyone's experience is valid. Much love. ❤️
<33
People fight with each other and Balkanize into further and further segmented groups until they are completely alone.

Resist the balkanization. We are all stuck on this hell hole rock together. We are all gonna die
Yeah, it's very disheartening to see hate in our community. Us trans folk have to stick together. :( We're all going through the same shit.
Thank you, we love you too <3
no more discourse! let’s all hug each other please
Seems like immature people who have alot of ingrained transportation still. It's not a competition! And we shouldnt be gatekeeping!We're all valid in our identities!
ayo what? can i have some context because the closest thing i've seen to this is trans men being underrepresented
☺️ bi/Mtf/Cross dressers I have  heard everybody complain about everybody why can’t we all just have fun and get along💗
Did I miss something? I haven't really seen any of this lol.
Me a trans woman who thinks trans men, women, and enbies are all awesome. 🥰🥰
From on trans women to the rest of you xoxoxo ♡ fighting and poking people in our community is detrimental to what we are all striving for. I'm with you all!
💕💗🫶🏼🎀🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏴‍☠️💅🏼
>Im seeing trans women complaining about trans men. Trans men complaining about trans women.

That's just how it is. I can't really speak for r/ftm but the discourse on r/mtf is just so fucking annoying. I don't have a witty comment, it's just fucking stupid and childish. 

I'm just gonna be upfront, I fucking hate anyone who tries dividing the community, especially those ""all the trans men I met (were rude)"" types. Humbling to remember being trans doesn't make you a good person.

I'm awfully close to unsubbing from r/mtf because it's just getting on my nerves big time
the tired old LGBTGIA+ infighting that does no one any good.

I am very new to my transition, as in I just told my entire family and friends this past week, but I’ve lurked in here for days and I do know what you mean. It kind of killed my confidence a little, but then I’ve seen some seriously supportive and helpful posts that have made me smile so I’ve tried to focus more on those.
Don't worry, people like me who just come here when I get a notif don't see them trolls terfs and other bigots that much, we just see a garden in which we feel at peace, in which we don't feel discomfort scrolling down a lot. There is a natural solidarity that is really showing up. That make family and homies cringe at whatever xenophobic attempt these cringe people are making, don't fear anything, that is what they want.
Defo! Im trans mtf and i have dated a trans guy before, as well as the fact that the person who even made me consider that i wasnt cis was a trans dude as well! So yeah! 🏳️‍⚧️❤️❤️
Sorry, but I gotta disagree. I think these disagreements are important and that they help people feel their feelings without worrying or feeling ashamed. I get that these posts make some people nervous and stressed, but the community is bound to fight. s I don’t want my feelings policed which seems to be a common occurrence in the lgbt community.
It's these kinda posts than fan the flames imo.
I never really met a hateful transwoman. I had one who was insecure about herself and projected her insecurities  on me, saying I look like a prepubescent boy, which I was I wasn't on Testosterone... then proceeded to tell me I needed to work on myself but, I didnt say anything about her appearance but she could have really worked on herself too. That being said we dont have much control on how we look like in the first place.

I believe a few things that have stirred up a fight between is that both sides feel dysphoric towards some topics that are being celebrated by the other person. Therefore they could have felt left out. And some things in transitioning is easier than others, which could result in jealousy
I really, really have so much love for all of you and the journeys you’re all on, myself included (trans woman). 💜🏳️‍⚧️

As a collective group, I find it really hard to talk about my euphoria and dysphoria, knowing they are the opposites for so many other folks. I don’t wanna hurt others while venting or sharing my happiness. So I end up just not sharing until I get back to my corner of my binary, with more shared experiences.

Relatedly, when I started my medical transition, I got a therapist so that I’d have someone to talk to (outside my circle) about the changes. I found an awesome trans man who was a fantastic therapist and things were great, for a while. But as my body began to really change, and I would describe my euphoria, I became increasingly more conscious of what that kind of talk might be like for him to hear. Even if he’s a professional, he’s an empathic human, with his own trans struggles. I found myself holding back that stuff after a while.

We have have common lovely things to bond over and threats to band against. But arguing who has it worse or generalizing binary experiences as universal has no place here. Stay amazing, friends!
As a trans woman I just wanna say how much I love and support trans men/trans mascs. I don’t wanna generalize or anything but so many of my favorite people are trans mascs and their souls are so so beautiful. Stay strong and know that we’re rooting for you!
I dont understand where the hate comes from. Sure I don't completely relate to what a transman goes through but we share common ground being both born in the wrong bodies. Also I've noticed a lot of transmen I've met/befriended are so much hotter then cismen. Why ya'll so attractive? >//<
Me, an enby in the midst of it all: 🥲
But... honey... its okay to complain as long as its not based in bigotry. We're a diverse group of people and we can't all get along. I've had MANY encounters with super toxic gaslighting transmen - and I'm not gonna go around being silent about that based on some weird sense of solidarity.

Can we not just be who we are, instead of constantly having to be homogenized?

And while you're doing that whole cutesy checking privilege thing.

I find it real fucking interesting that your solidarity posts fails to mention the BIPOC trans segment and you seem oblivious to the collossal amounts of racism that happens in white trans circles.

But hey, you do you. yeah Im a bitch.
Ok now I’m curious, what are trans women complaint about in regards to trans men and what are trans women complaining about in regards to trans men?
People will be people.

I just use the downvote button if I see someone acting like a jerk.

I've even seen mods acting like shits before and got banned for calling them out. (not here, another sub, obviously)
I've only seen one post like that tho I only follow the r/trans subreddit and that one time all I did was comment that I disagreed and then me and my friends had a conversation so I could make sure they were good people and supported transfemmes (which they did, if they hadn't I would have stopped talking to them) so you got three transmascs (he/him for one, he/they for another, and it/he/they for me) and one nonbinary person (they/they) who wholeheartedly support 1000000% of the community
I've experienced lots of toxicity from fellow trans ppl, especially on reddit.
Wait, what? Why?
The only posts I've seen on ftm have been posts of valid concerns that exist due to trans male invsibility and dismissal that is a very real thing. I don't really look at mtf but I haven't seen any discourse. Moreso posts of people being genuinely hurt at having their experiences and feelings dismissed.
Grasshoppers and locusts are the same species (though not all grasshoppers can become locusts). Grasshoppers live quieter, more solitary lives, and locusts do not. This change is caused by strain on food supply, an environmental stressor. I think that’s why we’re seeing this uptick. Things are stressful af for all trans people right now. 

I think sometimes there are some valid issues raised but they’re mostly, but not always, talked about in really toxic ways. And sometimes the whole of what’s being said is toxic. The world around us purposefully teaches us the opposite of solidarity and it can take effort to learn how to communicate constructively with someone you have a difference of opinion with. 

All of this means that solidarity is even more important right now though. Even though some of us might be perpetuating some bs right now, it’s originating outside of our community. 

I don’t mean to say that we should just allow this bs to flourish in our communities. I just think that sometimes understanding what is happening helps to combat it more easily. 

I personally don’t call a lot of stuff out because I can barely do life right now. Like I’m having problems being able to leave my house right now and I haven’t been able to take care of myself fully for a long time now. That probably isn’t relatable to some, but we all have our own stuff. I’m grateful for the people who can and do speak up, and I’m grateful for the sentiment expressed here and in a lot of other posts. I think it’s important to remember that the worst voices sometimes are or seem like the loudest and that it’s not representative of us as a whole.
I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I love you too OP ☺️
I love all my trans brothers, trans sisters, and non-binary siblings! Y'all are awesome!
Transmasc here, not sure why there's so much discourse recently but I saw in the ftm sub that the mods are gunna try get rid of those discourse posts. We need to keep our trans solidarity👍
Could be some alt right nutjob psyops nonsense ment to divide the community if you ever see a post like that check the profile and report if nessasary
its just the loud minority, i think.
Sounds like psyops to me.
Where the fuck can i find photos of bottom growth 

Like Jesus fucking Christ please 

I feel like it’s werid to ask random men online to show me close up photos of there pussy but ffs
It's honestly a freaking mindfield for a transfemme enby who wants phallo without vn. I just need *some* supportive community that can help me through all this.
From your gay brother… you guys are all super humans!  Full love and support to each one of you.
99+% of trans people love and support each other. I think it’s safe to ignore the anomalies.
Thank you for your support 💜💜💜
I feel weird about infighting in super publicly visible spaces like a subreddit anyway. Who does that benefit? Not any of us as far as I can tell. The people who hate us probably like it though.
I’m all for banding together with awesome trans people of all genders against shittiness from within the community!

Nothing but love for transmasc siblings and brothers, and non-binary siblings, sisters and brothers
Trans woman here and I 100% agree, we should be dealing with the people who want to see us die on ditches, not each other
I have a feeling that its possibly terfs and truscum tbh. We just need to call it out and report it if they dont relent.
Either trolls or terfs.
Likely terfs, they are known for pulling things like this
Thank you💜
Id say its probably a mix of Trolls and Terf type of trans folx that are trying to create the dissent between us
Ohh yeah it could be.
Most likely, makes no sense to be fighting each other, also all trans folk I know irl are pretty much all of the same friend group so I’m pretty sure they don’t hate each other, unless they all going for the keep your enemies closer approach
This is my suspicion tbh wouldn't be the first time our community's have been attacked checking profiles are a sure fire way to figure it out most aren't smart enough to know Post history is a thing.
exactly, everyone struggles with different things relating to transness. it's not only about being FTM or MTF or anything outside that binary. It's also about how accepting your family is, your friends, your country, how accessible your healthcare is, if you have dysphoria or not, and how bad it is, how old you are.  


There are so many factors, so saying the other side has it easier isn't right. Specifically binary trans people might be on the complete opposite side of each other, loving a body that the other loathes and vice versa, but we should help each other through that, not fuel hate.
dang I'm sorry that is happening. I wish we could do better.
Honestly this doesn't feel random now that you're saying it, couple of months ago something like this happened and now it's happening again. This is a  planned attack to divide the online queer communities but trans fems and women should maybe try and understand what trans mascs and men go through to understand how to better our relationship with including them.
thank you parent ❣️
Good parent *pat pat*, thanks for being so supportive 💙💖🤍💖💙 It's so important to be accepting your trans child. My mom is my biggest hero, and she's accepting me so well. Lots of love to you 🥰
Awwww ❤️❤️❤️
Aw that's so sweet, it still breaks my heart how this is not the default for most parents. :')
>Am I just seeing the corrective response from that discourse?

The timeline matches up with your guess.
well when it goes one way it's invading their personal space and the other way they are thanked
Thats a sweet way of looking at it!!!
Aw, I like how you put it :)
I just woke up and went through everything I missed and im so surprised! It has been very enlightening!!!
huh, i've mostly seen ftm people saying that it's fine for mtf people to hang out there. so long as trans women are respectful and don't dominate the sub, most of us are happy to have you.
I tried to give my two cents about when I was a boy and was downvoted. Once I mustered the courage to post a timeline on the trans discord, but trans men simply continued their meaningless conversation not related to timelines whatsoever and completely ignored it. I won't go to places I'm not wanted and I shouldn't be forced to. This should be that happy middle ground where we collaborate
Agreed, I feel that we can seriously trade our experiences to help each other out. Were all on the same side at the end of the day.
I mean to us T is literally a poison, just as E is a poison for you. Its just a matter of perspective, and I doubt its meant to invalidate transmascs intentionally, but if its really that controversial, I can start calling it out. If feel that many of our overlapping experiences can offend each other in various ways. For example getting erections sends me into a spiral, whereas, talking about starting a PMS cycle could set you off. Its all based on an individual experience as to what offends people unfortunately. The best we can do is avoid making sweeping statements and generalisations. Sometimes things are said that can be taken as offensive but not intended to cause offense, like the poison discussion. 

We just need to work around it and set boundaries. We shouldnt be working against each other, we're far stronger together.
💜💜💜
The what; am I of the loop here?
that is at least also what can be read in one of the post on the MtF subreddit where people asked why it was on the trans women to make more representation for trans men
As a trans girl, I've never really liked a lot of feminist spaces because of that tone you mentioned. Before I came out, I was in a few queer spaces and with all women friends. A lot of them would say they hate men and that I was one of the good ones or how they never really saw me as a man, man. Once a dude walked by our table, didn't even look in our direction, and a girl just scowled and said she hated men. Other times they'd assume I couldn't relate to a sad breakup song because I was a guy and guys were the only ones who hurt people or something.

I dunno, I feel like a lot of progressive people think that dudes have no problems that come from being dudes other than the ones related to not being allowed to cry or not being allowed to be close to friends, and never the ones that they are directly contributing to
LMAO “can trans men wear femme clothes” “can trans men wear pink” “can-“ YES
me first me first!!
You can just say ""siblings"", heh.
💜💜💜
💜💜💜
I hate when they have ingrained transportation too. Sorry I couldn’t help myself….
i think it's okay for there to be some disagreements, but the level of discourse is just getting higher and higher and that makes me nervous. it's okay to disagree but at the end of the day we need to support each other if we want equality.
Thats valid. I think after seeing all these replies that this has been a net positive. People have been able to come and talk about whats going on and how they feel about it from both sides in an open meeting ground. I kinda like how enlightening all these replies have been.
Do you really think so? Im just trying to spread kindness? And everyone seems to be so nice and polite in talking about how we feel together?
>a lot of transmen I've met/befriended are so much hotter then cismen

Please don't do that. I know you mean well, but to many it can feel invalidating to be separated from cis men (in this case, but it's the same for women).
It's not necessarily that all have to be homogenized, but there's a difference between ""some trans men have behaved badly"" and ""trans men behave badly"" -- I think the latter is what the OP is trying to call out. I've definitely dealt with a lot of bad behavior from trans women, but it's important to remember that those are individuals and that discouraging trans women as a whole from participating isn't a valid solution.
Well you make somewhat of a point even if I feel like you are just stirring the pot for the sake of it. The bottom line is I support all BIPOC and ofcourse I stand against racism too but that wasnt the main issue i wanted to address with this post especially when Im white and its not my place to tell BIPOC people about their struggles. I couldnt do it justice but like I said I love everybody and i want EVERYONE to have safe spaces.
At first glance, I genuinely thought you meant OP was a psyop and started cackling at the idea of a pro-inclusivity psyop promoting understanding & positivity, and it was the funniest shitpost I’ve seen all week
yeah, just downvote them.
Or 4 channers
This
As someone who got caught up in the recent discussion... not necessarily.
To be fair, there's a lot of crossover between those two types.
At this point may as well be the same thing
There seems to be waves with different targets, latest I've seen going around aside from the OP's observation is against sex workers. Those posters usually start out with an understandable if overzealous demand justified with spam accounts and then show their whole ass later in the comments.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That is so good to hear!  Sending you lots of love ❤️
❤️❤️❤️
Agreed. I don't know how anyone can call themselves a ""good"" parent otherwise. I love my daughter and would die for her. I love all of you here and it saddens me the struggles you endure. It breaks my heart. Thank you for the kind words ❤️.
Thank you I felt it very strongly, that and I consume entirely too much poetry and Jane Austen. Lol!
Its the same in the MTF sub as well. Ill try better to call out BS though, its not on and while our experiences differ, we're all on the same team.
No one is obligated to talk to you about your experiences
Tbf it's pretty normal for people to continue their ""meaningless"" conversations and not immediately make you the center of attention every time you want to be. Also, about those ""two cents"" --

> Get a buzz cut and ditch the piercings. If you wanna be a man you gotta try and look like a man, not a girlish boy

You might be the problem here.
I don't know how to stay this, so please forgive me if I come off as rude

I don't like the beginning of the paragraph because I don't think there's any trans person that doesn't know it's a matter of perspective, and it sounds a bit dismissive. And I get what you're saying about doubting whether it's intentional or not, but I feel that's kinda a moot point. Imagine how you'd feel if someone used your deadname and they don't know you transitioned. Imagine if you asked them not to do that and they say something like ""from my perspective it wasn't meant to invalidate you, but if it's so important, I won't call you that anymore."" 

I dunno about you, but that would leave a bad taste in my mouth. Sure, they're gonna stop deadnaming you, but it just feels a lil defensive? Idk, I agree with a lot of what you're saying but the way you said it kinda felt like preaching to the choir and a lil weird

Have a wonderful day!
totally. i think if people wanna rant about mtf-specific issues, they need to do that mtf-specific subs. likewise, ftm folks need to keep ftm-specific discussion to our designated subs. otherwise, shared subs like this one get cluttered up with things that only half of the users can relate to in any way. and generally, we need to be more mindful about who might see it and whether that's the right place for it.
I assume they're talking about the queen of England. Not sure what they have to do with trans hate. If anything its the people in parliament that you want to riot against
I also got sick of is [thing that is a super common normal effect of T] normal? And the I'm going on T how do I prevent everything but these one or two things I want to happen?
you’re so cute ily
Thanks!
Reminds me of when my bicycle seat was stolen...
Your intentions are fine, but I see way more discourse about discourse than actual infighting
Hmm, I guess it could be taken that way, you're right!   


EDIT: I think a lot of the reason why is a lot of trans people in general take much better care of themselves, either because of Dysphoria reasons or just that they're much more comfortable in their bodies after transition.
[removed]
I get it. I'm glad you understood me, though.
Also this
The main difference is trolls get enjoyment out of negative comments, and terfs think they are on a mission to ""save their lost lesbian sisters"" or whatever they lie to themselves about.
I personally think, that knowing you are in the wrong and still doing it is better than thinking you are doing the right thing while you do the opposite.
Oh hey!! That comment was actually on my transpassing post ahahaha. Weird to see it mentioned here

Yeah it was a weird comment and very harsh imo

That's not really a great analogy since that person isn't talking purely about themselves and their own experience.
>queen of England

Did you mean the [Queen of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_the_United_Kingdom), the [Queen of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada), the [Queen of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia), etc?

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.
[removed]
Very much agreed!
This comment made me giggle, because I've had more than one terf basically tell me that I'm a confused lesbian, or that it's okay to just be a butch lesbian, and I'm just like, ""yeah, I'm not sexually attracted to women"". They get really confused.
This has nothing to do with you being MTF and everything to do with you disregarding and denigrating the feelings of others and still expecting them to drop everything at a moment's notice to cater to you. Maybe their conversations aren't meaningless to them. Maybe they're not trying to conform to *your* idea of masculinity.
You can be honest without potentially making someone feel dysphoric mate

Edit: if you want to give advice like that, say “maybe see what you look like with/without (insert clothing or feature).”

That’s a polite way to suggest a change, and it isn’t going to make them feel bad or dysphoric.
True, it's not a perfect analogy, I'll admit that. It was an appeal to her emotions and a kinder way of saying that I thought she was being a little dismissive in a way I think we can all relate to

The emotion I intended to be evoked was more important than the analogy's accuracy

But yeah, you're right. I made an unfair comparison and for that I apologize
I think you have the wrong Queen of Canada.

But they're trying to be masculine while wearing round glasses and flashy earrings isn't. It's a rhetorical question to ask do I pass dressed in stereotypically feminine accessories. I get it dress as you please, but don't be surprised when you get clocked. That's all
[removed]
He wasn't trying to pass as a masc man, just to be androgynous/not immediately just seen as a woman, and said as much. It's also just bad advice. A buzz cut will rarely make a pre-T AFAB person look more like a man, often it just accentuates naturally feminine features. A couple inches of hair like the person had would give him a better chance.

Also, you didn't say ""If you want to pass as a man."" You said ""If you want to *be* a man.""
The amount of times I've seen cis het men wearing jewelry and ""feminine"" glasses tells me you don't really know what you're talking about. You might have some idea of what masculinity is in your mind, but you should respect that it's not the same as everyone else's.
You seem like a miserable, rude person tbh

Makeup is overrated! You don't have to wear any to be a woman. Just be you and let your inner light shine- it's more beautiful than anything you put on <3
I almost never do my own makeup. It's such a freaking hassle. You look great without it <3
You look amazing! Don't ever let someone tell you you \*have\* to do makeup. It's totally optional. : )
How did you get such a smooth shaven face? I’m coming up on 7 months HRT and I don’t like makeup either. I want to be as pretty as you.
You are stunning, no makeup needed.
Ur beautiful
so lucky, if i ever transitioned (which i never will cause i'm a buttugly troll) i know i'd have to get hundreds of thousands in surgery and also have to wear hundreds in makeup to look even slightly ok
I know makeup is hard, im brand new and learning it myself, but find a pallet you like, some cheap brushes and just go wild and treat it like painting! Its worked for me
Babe your hot! Congrats on challenging yourself :)
not gonna lie, you look INCREDIMAZING (incredible and amazing, it's because your beauty can't be actually described in words). I actually felt butterflies in my stomach, you look incredible

Amazing! So much loveliness! Your hair, smooth skin, lovely lips, I see some tiddies and great hips all wrapped in an outfit chosen by someone who is on point! Congratulations
No makeup looks perfect, wish I could pull that off. You are beautiful

Thank you for the compliment! Hugs
Oh? You mean in comparison to my other post where I had a beard? Or when? Both these pictures in the blue polka dot dress were taken that same day.
I can get that. They’re good-looking tattoos tho, and I think they add to the aesthetic you have going on here"	o9y5rh	trans	1322	0.98	2021-06-29 01:31:49
Heya I'm Lilly (17 MtF Pre-everything)! This is my first post on here :3 I am out to my family but too nervous to present female outside of my room so here is a ton of photos of me that make me happi.		"You are very pretty!!!
Hi, I’m Lily (15) who’s also too scared to present femme outside my room
/r/lilyistrans
Oi Lilly! Even if you’re too scared to present femme outside of your room, just know that there’s always people supporting you and wanting you to be happy and comfortable as yourself! You’re an incredibly pretty girl who deserves nothing but the best! So i and everybody else here will be supporting you! 
I’m in a very similar situation so I felt like reaching out, lol. Sorry if my comment was weird!
Cute
You’re hair is so pretty! :)

(Also this is a very big side note but, where’d you get the skirt? It’s super cute!)
Welcome
(don't listen to her, her hair is always pretty, it's even better messy)
boyfriend here, i got it from old navy, but it's been a few years
Thats awesome! Thats one thing i get anxiety from is thinking about how not alot of girls like weapons n stuff but it awesome seeing otherwise! And it toatally counts just medieval weapon from the klingon culture lol
Aw, thank you! >_>
Ahh. Completely understand. <3
No problem lily friend :)
It’s cute!
On  a side note, where did you get that skirt, it's really cute ;-;
Y W.
<333
I got it on romwe! Everything there is super cheap. Unfortunately that means it's not the best quality but I'll take anything LOL
thanks for the info!  I wanna score one for myself :)
yup yup I've always been a big ol nerd :3
<333
I got it off of romwe! Everything is extraordinarily cheap there!
I hope one day I can see your pretty face!!
I get that. But thanks for telling me about where you got it, it’s definitely something I wanna wear myself when I can, lol. 
It was fun talking to you about this Lilly! if you ever wanna talk more about gender or, anything, my DMs are open! (You just seem cool and trustworthy, so I’d wanna talk if you’re ever cool with it, lol. Sorry if that’s weird.)
So. You’re a valid and incredible girl and deserve nothing but support!
i don't blame you! i had two, and was originally going to give her both, but had to keep one because of how nice they are. i believe they're typically called mock turtlenecks, if that helps your search :>
that would be funnnn :D
Oh my gosh you're so sweet yes I'd love to chat I'm free all the time.
I believe in you!!!"	p3odp9	trans	1318	0.98	2021-08-13 16:18:49

Something, something japanese words. I speak it to. I do actually speak some japanese, but I'm so close to falling asleep I'm not even gonna try to figure out what has been said.
you are so very welcome...im VERY glad you are not here in the states right now with all this insanity..stay safe and you are beautiful and loved!
That just made my day. Thank YOU so much
Thank you, that means so much to me 💜🏳️‍⚧️
They are an ally and I had a good experience when I posted my selfies there. There's actually a lot of trans women on that sub. The popular posts on that sub have been in support of the trans community. I highly recommend checking it out. Especially if you are of the witchy sort.
My daughter is trans so I’m curious how you are treated in Japan vs US.
What kind of spell?

It shows 💜
Nooo I meant as in

I've never actually been to USA so I can't comment on how I would be treated there 💙🖤x
Ahhhh that's so cute 🥺
Its been a long day im so sorry lmao
Hmm, fine, I'll try and figure it out, but I'm tired, so if I can't remember enough, I'm just gonna use google translate.
You aren’t missing anything 🫤
As are you! Have a wonderful weekend!
Nono you're okay Kerri 💙🖤x ^=^
Hehe ^÷^ x
Thank you 💙🖤
You too 😘x
I know all the hiragana, but I'm still new, so I couldn't figure out the other characters. I'm also very tired, and couldn't remember much of the hiragana, even though I know them by heart. Idk I'm tired, I used google translate, and it believed you were thanking them, and it also took what they said as (edit:good luck/do your best) good job/good luck, or something along those lines, I'm forgetting things again.
Good job! You're doing great don't worry ^=^ 💙🖤
Keep up the good work, and get a good rest
You'll get there x
Thank you, I should also stop learning four languages at the same time, though. Well, five because I'm still learning english.

Can’t believe I missed this but there’s another non-binary character in The Owl House and it makes me happy!		"They’ve even got the colors on their nails! 🤭
Can we talk about how powerful it would be to have your pronouns on one of those fancy metal desk things teachers and bosses have like the one in this pic?
Disney:""you're too gay so you're being cancelled""

Owl house: *gets even gayer*
Also, I'm convinced Masha knows that Vee was disguised as Luz which is why they seem to brush off Vee's obviously BS answer to ""do I know you from somewhere?"" XD
""We can all thank goddess for that."" 😏
Owl house try not to be insanely based challenge (Literally impossible)
They are just so likeable, great character
their nails are so pretty
I AM GONNA STEAL THEIR GENDER!!! BEWARE!!
And then ppl still say 'Dont assume every cartoon character is queer'
i didnt even notice the plaque lmao i just saw the nails when i watches
YEAAAAAA
I've never seen The Owl House since Disney lost it's magic. Is it something I may like? What's it about?
Would be nice if they added the second season to Disney+ in Denmark
I am very normal about them.
THE NAILS 😃
If never heard of The Owl House, but I saw b_peanutbuttr's TikTok about this character
I screamed when i saw them i love them so much already! 💛🤍💜🖤
Owl house pulling out the awsome characters
""Finally I get to be a part of something!""
Oh shiiiiiiit!
yesss i loved that detail. AND VEE GOT ALL BLUSHY AAAAA I NEED THE NEXT EPISODE
It’d be such a major power move for sure! I hope one day I can get there!
I need to watch the owl Hose ahhhh
I asked the engineering class to create me one with their fabricator last year, but it’s still being developed by the student group.
When you have nothing left to lose. ""We need to go gayer! GAYER!!!'
Dana: ""What are they gonna do? Cancel us MORE?""
TOH: If I die... YOU'RE COMING WITH ME!!!
So you've planted the nuke

&#x200B;

Sike you turds are coming down with us
Too based for disney 😔
Season 3 is doing a pro gamer move by being absurdly poggers!
It’s really good. So good, The mouse cancelled it for being too hack’n gay!
Try a vpn.
I don’t TikTok but it’s a very good show. Highly recommend.
might I suggest:

https://www.amazon.com/Toblerone-Personalized-Swiss-Chocolate-12-6oz/dp/B085GLYZC4
Honestly I have an engraved name badge from my last job which I may include on my new job with my pronouns
What's the plot? I like to hear it from fans rather than read about on IMDB or Wiki. If it's too much for Disney then that's saying alot
Or the seven seas

Arr!
lol
That's awesome!
I'm. Yes 100% of this. My family does chocolate letters every year for Christmas but I think this would be much better 🤣
Girl finds a portal to another realm, the demon real where there’s magic. I really don’t like to spoil stuff. It’s really good.
A girl named luz accidentally finds herself in a place named the Bolling illes where demon's and monsters and witches exist, she then finds a old witch named eddna who decides to teach her magic, she lives with her with a demon named King (voiced by Alex herch) as she attends magic school while slowly learning about a sinister plot, it's also extremely gay with several trans and gay characters, and the main character is bi
Luz (our main character) gets isekai'd into the demon realm where she meets a witch named Eda and her little companion named King, the big bad is Emperor Belos, I REALLY don't wanna spoil who he really is but there's a whole episode about that, fast forward to season 2 and now the show is full on gay and kinda dark, Luz falls in love with one of those ""perfect girls"" who was forced to live this type of way by her narcissistic mother and clueless dad (who gets a redemption arc later on), the girl's name is Amity and she's lesbian (Luz is bi), update on King, he's a titan which are pretty much gods in the demon realm and their dead bodies turn into islands, oh and there's this little Collector guy who's ""a child of the stars"" and pretty much the strongest thing in the demon realm, Belos betrays everyone and roasts the annoying secondary villain (Kikimora), he goes to Earth after sentencing the Boiling Isles (the island most people from the show live on) to death, that's where we get season 3 (oh and Luz and her friends also go to Earth).
Spoilers don't ruin a show for me as the shock value is nothing compared to the actual show. But thank you for your consideration with others here. 

Some people get bothered by spoilers like what happened at the end of the Avengers movie lol the guy spoiling it for everyone was funny to me.
I watched episode 1 of season 1. I will be watching more but I don't really understand why it was cancelled after season 3. Of course the internet is very divided on the reasoning as I doubt this wasn't popular and/or the direction Disney was leaning towards may have had something to do with it but i really like long series. Like Supernatural! That went on forever
If you like shows like She Ra or Amphibia you’ll probably like The Owl House.
Some high ranking assholes said ""it doesnt fit with our brand!!!!111!!"" and season 3 was cut to 3, 45 min specials, but they recently realized their mistakes (unfortunately, nothing can be done to keep the show going).
I just finished Season 3 episode 1 after the two magical seasons. I'm in love with Hootcifer and all the characters introduced thus far. So many things left to theories and I simply can't wait for episodes 2 and 3 short lived or not. This was so great that I'm checking out Amphibia but so far episode hasn't grabbed my attention like TOH"	yt05r4	trans	1301	0.98	2022-11-12 07:50:17

You look like one of the actresses from Hannibal! So pretty!
Weird thought but you look exactly like I imagine Navanni Kholin to look in my favorite book series Stormlight Archives.

In other words I'm totally jealous.
Omg where do I get those pants????

U r gorgeous

Well, agreed that people should live their truth, MtF, FtM or in between.  But you also realize that not everyone can do this, for different reasons.. I mean, you're a beautiful, passable woman... that makes living your truth much easier.  Not every MtF woman is so lucky.  We should respect everyone's decision to transition, or not.
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
😊😘😘
Happy for you, its great to see the happiness and you look very beautiful, you should be proud girl 💙
Wow 👍🏼😍
I just found your Reddit, first I wanted to say how sorry I am that you lost your fur buddy, I couldn't express my condolences on that post because goofy Reddit closes any ability to leave a message. I can't imagine your pain and I wanted you to know how bad I felt seeing you so sad..they really are family and anyone who says otherwise are morons. 
 
 I also wanted to say what a stunning beautiful woman you are...I can't find one bad pic and screw that neighbor who ignored you, you are an absolutely stunning woman , please forgive me I don't want to sound like a crazy person but I had to write my thoughts of you, you really do stand out as an exceptional beauty and I wanted you to know that.

Ok I'm done being a dork, I hope things are good for you and you are doing well...thank you for your time, love your post, thanks again and take care...Ron Castro

Thanks! I've been wanting to switch it up by from swooping it all to one side. This turned out to be fairly cute. 🙆🏾‍♀️
I love you both
Baby steps! I started buying women's clothes over a decade ago, 7 years practicing makeup, 6 years of sneaky walks in public, told my first friend 5 years ago, started posting in reddit a year ago, came out this last spring. I wish I had come out sooner, but I wasn't ready. 

This happiness was hard earned and well deserved. It's something I hope every one of my closeted comrades achieves. Because, I have seen the top of the mountain, light at the tunnel's end. I have witnessed true love in my own reflection... and it is good. 💖😭
I love you both
Thank you! I want to try curling it next. I really have no idea how to style it, but I'm excited to try!
Thank you for the support, babe! 😽
Thanks hun! You too! 😘

😘
For sure! I think it's incredibly important for people to consider their safety before coming out. Transitioning is a huge decision and one that should be deeply considered before justing into head first. This post, however, isn't a rallying call for those in question to transition. Its a statement of personal pride as well as a reminder to not give up on happiness, regardless of their plans to transition or not.
Your whole life is a sin
No it isn't. Stop making things up. 😏
aaaaaa this reply sparks joy! But its har dto open up in a homophobic country when everyone gets it as a joke cuz ur 14.
You're welcome beautiful 🥰
True, that.  And you're a terrific example of a girl who has it together!
I’m not trans 😂
Ok I will stop. Being trans is a sin 😂

For the first time in months, I looked at myself with a smile	I (MtF) got my first skirt recently and I  just almost cried, because when I look at myself, I finally see a girl. I am so happy, just needed to share.	"Glad you were able to smile but even more sharing well done you keep your faith in yourself
I can't wait to start HRT, still waiting for the Doctor to call back
So happy for you!!   Way to start the day 💕
im so happy for you :3
Although the question remains: does the skirt go spinny?
I had that moment a couple of months ago. Never lose that feeling of true happiness in yourself.
that is the greatest thing, girl. You deserve that
:)
Proud of you!
Ya got it girl! :D
Congratulations 💜💜💜
you go, girl 🌻
Im so happy for you! Hope you'll have that feeling more often❤️
I've just recently gotten to the point of seeing a girl in the mirror, even if I haven't shaved in a bit and my stubble is getting messy. It really is an amazing feeling. All my life I had hated the way I looked, but now I sometimes have to stop to check myself out in the mirror for a bit because I love the way I look
That's Beautiful!.. and so are you! Enjoy every single moment that makes your spirit feel light! Treasure the smile that came from accepting and appreciating Yourself and remember to Not make that beautiful smile a cover for any pain. The same ones that are happy to share your joy can also be a shoulder or a compassionate (& often informative) ear if/when you need.  
Thank you so much for passing along your smile!😁💓💋🦊
Proud to happiness
Thank you :D It took me so long to take the first baby steps, but now I truly believe that I'll be able to be myself one day

My mum made me cry on Christmas day	"I came out to my family several weeks ago, and they were nothing but supportive about the whole thing, and took very quickly to using my new name and pronouns. Come Christmas day my mum is round at my place, and in a very excitable way (she has been incredibly excited for me and my transition, even more so than I have tbh), she gave me a Christmas card, which on the front read:

""To a special **daughter** with love""

I sat there staring at it for a good minute with this stupid grin on my face. I opened it and saw the message she had written inside:

>For Ariel  
>  
>Wishing you much love & happiness now and forever,  
>  
>Mum xxx

I kept sitting there for what felt like an eternity just smiling at this card, before looking at her, saying ""Thank you"", and then I just burst into tears. I spent the next 20minutes ugly crying in her arms as she hugged and comforted me. Afterward when she looked at me, she smiled and laughed a little telling me I need to invest in waterproof mascara."	"Oh man I thought it was like cry in a bad way. But this is just touching. So happy for you hun ☺️
""Waterproof mascara"", that's a mothers love for her daughter right there.
And now I'm crying. Lol
read the title and was like “man not again” but this story is actually wholesome
That's so sweet and adorable, I'm happy it was the good kind of crying!!
This is lovely! It was my daughter's first Christmas since she came out to us all this year. She loved receiving cards in her chosen name and girlie gifts for the first time :)
SO CUTE AHHHH FJDHDHDBD
Aww 😭
So wholesome - you deserve it, girl!
Awww love this so much! ❤️
This is too much for my little heart. Im melting ❤
Thank you for my morning cry lol I’m so so happy for you! I know I’m just some stranger on the internet lmao but I wish I could give you a big hug. The best feeling is when someone is not only supportive, but also is *excited* on top of it.
:0 this is so wholesome. wish my christmas day was like that. instead i spent the whole day building my brothers lego, so i couldnt build my own. and my mom had a bunch of people round who dont like me, i dont like them either. i appretiate being able to vent
damn i was about to come into the comments and support you because i thought she was being mean to you, awesome that you have supportive family wish u all the best maam :))
Omg that's so cute!! My mum called me the T slur on christmas
Omg what a nice story lol. Clickbait haha 🤣, however it is the best kind.
Awwww that’s so sweet what a wonderful mother you have!
you won the mom lottery! that's lovely.
I'm so happy for you!
wish i had a family like this godamn... well glad to hear you cried in a good way :3
bless your Mama Bear   for being  fabulous
Aaaand now we are all crying 😭
I thought it was the bad form of crying, but the tears of joy is touching!
I was so worried the card had your dead name for a moment. But that's just so sweet
Here I am slowly leaking.tears myself.   Congrats.
Good for you! It's always nice to hear about families supporting people coming out as trans, even though I'll never get that support...
If this isn’t luck I don’t know what is
I have a Christmas story too. I came out to my sister on Christmas and after we talked for a bit she asked me how the fuck I'm still unsure and how I manage to see myself as trans and male (I'm transfem) at the same time
This is amazing to say the least! So happy for you.
I’m like, speechless. Wow OP, that’s some mother you have there. I’m really happy for you. Thanks for sharing.
That is so heartwarming. Maybe I should share this one with my mom... Eh maybe not... But seriously, I am so happy for you and your family!
I'm so happy this turned out well for you!
I just about cried reading this. I'm so happy for you. I was worried it was cry in a bad way but I'm glad it wasn't.
I’m so happy for you!
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
This is sooo sweet! Ahh, you made me cry! 

As a fellow trans woman who cries too much, waterproof mascara is awesome! Lol. 

I'm very happy for you and your loving family! Happy new year!
This is amazing! My fairly conservative uncle bought all of the women in our family a meaningful piece of jewelry and included me.
Aw this made me cry!
I’m almost in tears myself you have wonderful beautiful awesome parents and family LOVE ❤️
I was waiting for the whole time for the bad part, like that you're actually FTM or you haven't actually chosen a name yet and hate ""Ariel"" but this is actually wholesome
OMG this is amazing.  

&#x200B;

It did NOT go the way I was expecting from the title!  I would have cried too!  

&#x200B;

She sounds wonderful.
I began reading, scared that this would just be someones transphobic parents again, but this is the most heartwarming thing ever. Your mum is an angel.
you see i’m an idiot i read the whole thing and thought that meant you’re trans masc but she was actually being super respectful
Aw, that’s lovely! I wish you and your mum a happy 2022!
A great mom, and a practical mom!
Same. 😭
My grandma was the first one ever to give me a card after I came out and it was for my birthday a few months after coming out. It was addressed to granddaughter on the front and super pretty. I literally balled my eyes out opening and reading it. 

You're an amazing parent, thank you for supporting your beautiful daughter 💜
Aw, I hope everything turned out decent at least. Merry (belated) Christmas! :)
You're so sweet, thank you ❤️

That's so lovely about the card from your grandma.
thank you. i appreciate it! :>"	rskbxb	trans	1261	0.99	2021-12-31 03:32:36
Before I came out my older sister was a nanny and was introducing one of the kids to me. She said “This is my sister, (deadname)” and the kid looked at me for a second and said “why is your sister a boy?” and nothing has every made me more happy than that first moment of sincere validation.		"Kids are the best! When I started my transition and didn’t really pass 100% I was wearing a lot of eye makeup and face mask (because 2020) and the kids who came into the store I worked at would be like “she’s a princess” that shit melted my heart!!
Feels!!!! Oh the validation. I have a similar story…

I went to visit a friend recently to come out to her. I didn’t want her to open the door and “ta-da!”, see that I’m a woman without a proper conversation first. So I toned it down dressing andro and for the first 15 minutes she was totally oblivious to the fact dead-naming and dead-pronouning me while a bit distracted dealing with her 4 year old. 

Then her 4 year old suddenly interrupts her mom, looks at her seriously in the eye and asks “mom, why do you keep treating her like a boy if she’s a girl?”. My friend then starts to automatically correct her, embarrassed, while I try to interrupt calling out to her until I get her attention. I look at here and tell her “[friend name], I’m trans”. Her face just blanks out while her head spins a little, then she just turns around and responds to her kid “I’m sorry [daughter’s name], you’re right and mommy just made a mistake, she’s obviously a girl”. 💜
Kids really just are so pure . They know no hate.
(AFAB NB here, for context)

Recently my friend's 3 year old asked me ""why are you a girl?"" And all I could think to say was ""I don't know bud, cosmic misunderstanding?""
Well I'm glad you had some gender euphoria
love this. every know and then a little one will ask me if i'm a boy or a girl in public or at work. i just just smile and say no.
Love that.
Oh, I love that!
Moments like these always remind me that hate really is taught
I love the phrasing, beautiful
I love this story. Kids are so understanding. It’s why I love working with them.
Every comment on this, and the post itself just made me squeel with joy :')
Before I came out I told someone ""We're sisters"" when introducing my sister to someone. I ""didn't know"" I was trans then, but it sounded right to me even back then. Sadly in my case I was in denial for a long time.  Still that memory is a happy one.
aw thats so cute
This is nice and all and I see a lot of comments talking about how nice kids are but the kids in my naborhood are like the ages from 4-7 and if i told them I was a boy they would for sure make fun of me and be like “no girls cant be boys you have to stay a girl” but then they will see my hairy legs and pits and be like “your not even a girl, girls dont have arm pit hair” thiers litterally no winning with them ;-;
I’m not out to my family yet but my cousin (who is 7) tells me completely out of nowhere “you’re a boy. You may look like a girl but you are a boy, you’re a boy with a girls body” and let me tell you, I want to just cry tears of joy when he says that to me. The first time he said it we were in front of our families and I felt so damn crushed that I had to lie to him and “correct” him.

I’m very close with both him and his brother so I’m not surprised that he can read me like a book like that. I just wish I could tell them both the truth.
I'll never forget asking this Cis lesbian woman if she was a boy or a girl when I was a little kid. I was like 4 or 5. I also did sort of the same to an interracial woman when I asked her if she was black or white. Kids get confused and are sometimes are taught all this stuff like things have to black and white or boy and girl but people vary!!
I love this and I'm crying
Your friend is so cool about understanding and adjusting to the correction 🥺🖤
Omg, my heart hurts. Children are perfect.
What a wonderful story, my heart
This is such a sweet story on all fronts thank you for sharing
They really are the purest creatures.
I had a kid ask me that too (also afab gq) I told him it was punishment for my past life crimes.
Thank you!
You’d be surprised. This was a four year old boy in Alabama.
well yes but actually no
As a parent I can say: ""yes but actually no"" has never been more accurate.
As a former child (in technicality i guess) i too can confirm"	qpaj1f	trans	1249	0.99	2021-11-08 10:06:08

It's like MILF, but for dads. So, Dad I'd Like to Fuck. Meaning you look hot as hell!
Honestly doing what your doing will get you lean and build muscle also and gyms do suck depending on which ones you go to and honestly it’s what you can lift that you feel comfortable with cause I would max out and then drop 15-20 and go from there 

Thank you very much and yes it is
Ahh okay and we’ll definitely thank you for that!!

That’s a good way to start but if 5 don’t do it then go 10 or more but after three weeks of sticking to it and seeing results you will be addicted but stick with that for now and push yaself and do elevated pushups

I used to be like also when I first started going but always remember everyone started some where and who cares what they think or do bc at least you are there and doing what you feel is comfortable

Positivity!!
Thank you for spreading kindness, OP!  It's much appreciated.  You look amazing, and the poster you have in the background is awesome!  Have a good day.
Hi all, I’m so happy for you and for being witness to all the positivity and support in this sub. I’m on an inclusivity journey to make sure I’m the best ally I can be. I’m taking inclusivity trainings at work and they’re so enlightening. One of the things we are working on is the term “guys” as used to address a group of people, of any demographic. We have heard it can be triggering and we want to do our best to ensure we’re being careful and considerate with our language. I noticed OP uses the term “guys” to address a mixed demographic of specifically trans people, and specifically called out the ladies, whom I can only assume are trans women. I have no issues with this, I’m just curious to know if that had any impact on anyone here and if so, what that impact may be. Consider it a survey, if anyone is willing to share. I’m sure OP had nothing but the best intentions, of course. I’m wondering if OP noticed when that was written or posted or if it went unnoticed. I haven’t seen any comments addressing it, leading me to believe it was overlooked. That’s also a curiosity of mine. I might assume that it’s taken as non-offensive due to the source, which is perfectly understandable as that’s the case with any group of people hearing a term that has a meaning attached to identity. Again, this is just a curiosity if anyone is interested in Sharing their thoughts. Thank you for reading and thank you for your time.
U look amazinggggggg and hot 😌✨u go girl!
Are we plus sized women beautiful too? I need some love 😢😢
Aww, this is so sweet. 😭 I'm not a trans lady, but I share the sentiment. Y'all are like sisters to me and it makes me very happy when I see you living & thriving as your true selves, so even though this isn't directed to me, I thank you for giving so much love & support to this wonderful community. ❤️

Yes!!!!😌😌😌💕💕💕💕💕💕
Reading back on it now I can def see it as a trigger warning and I’m so sorry if I offended anyone. Not my intentions at all. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
This is definitely a good point and I applaud you for bringing it up. I personally don't see any harm in OP using ""guys"" as I've heard a lot of people say it in mixed company. My friends do that at times and I never get offended, even though I'm agender non binary & can get dysphoria when masculine gendered terms like sir are used to refer to me. The reason why I'm not offended is that when they use ""guys"", like the OP did here, it's meant in a gender neutral way. Nevertheless, it's definitely not a bad idea to be mindful of it. That's why I personally use ""y'all"" when talking to a group of people. Anyway, thanks for helping promote inclusivity!
Omg thank you so much love 😭😭💕💕💕
You have so much beauty to love💕💕💕😌 nothing wrong with being a plus sized beauty at all babe! Trust me! I’d love to gain some weight. I’ve been trying so hard 😭😭😭
Need more people like you😭😭😭😭 ty so much love. Loving having people like you in life💕💕💕
It’s already changed sweetie💕💕😂😂😂😂
That’s an odd compliment. Thanks.
No thank you Darling,for being you and giving us more beauty in this world
Yw❤️
\*looks at my unshaven chin, baggy shirt ruffled hair and shaking from over caffinattion\*  
im -always- gorgeous
Also cool poster
I totally understand how easy a habit it is to use that term. My fellow mentors and trainers and I are just starting on the journey to be more mindful and this particular term was one that seemed the most common to pose a challenge in removing it from our vocabulary. 

I did not mean to distract from your joy in your progress and success, you look amazing and I just hoped to get a little insight. I hope you have a wonderful day!
Hi and thank you for your thoughtful reply! It helped me understand quite a bit. I, too, am tending towards “y’all”, but also “folks” and the generic “everyone“ and I’m not sure what sounds most natural to me, but that’s just part of the fun of the journey of inclusivity, I guess: Learning how to be myself and natural while being able to respect everyone. 

I wanted to ask you about two points you made: the term “guys” being used in an obviously non-gender specific way and wondered what you thought about the term “dude“ when used in most contexts for emphasis rather than to address a certain person, but even when addressing a person, it seems to be gender-neutral these days, but I wanted to ask if that’s also your experience. Also, I was surprised to find out that the term “sir“ is actually gender neutral in the military of all places, where a female superior (officer, unit commander, captain, etc) would still be referred to as “sir”. Obviously that’s not how it’s used in most contexts in society, so I’m definitely not suggesting that anyone who has referred to you as sir was using it in a non-gender way, but I wonder if “Sir” would ever become gender-neutral like “dude”... but that’s really just a thought rather than something that we would deal with at this time. Just wondering your thoughts. Anyway, hope you’re having a wonderful day and thank you for your time and consideration.
You're very welcome. 🥰 Becoming a part of the trans community has brought me so much joy and it played a very big role in helping me realize that I myself wasn't cis, so I do whatever I can to thank you all by passing on those positive vibes & providing encouragement whenever I can. Anyway, much love & well wishes to you, beautiful angel. 💖
[removed]
Omg you’re the sweetest💕💕💕😭😭 I will always be a source of positivity for all you angels. Stay kind my love. You made my morning💕
LOL you made me chuckle. HEY! Those things are all normal for us LOL. You’re still beautiful! 😌💕
Thank you😌😌😌 I love old horror 😌😌💕💕
Your a treasure sweetie, thank you for caring!
I feel very bad because I posted this on another trans sub and I was actually conscious of typing and left out the term. I don’t know how it slipped on this one😔😔
I actually hadn't heard about the military usage of ""sir"". That's very interesting. As for ""dude"", I look at it the same way as ""guys"". For the most part, it doesn't bother me because it's generally used gender neutrally these days, though I can't speak for other non binary people. It's possible that they or my binary trans siblings would have a problem with it, but I believe most of them wouldn't since they'd realize it's not meant to misgender them.   


I can tell you definitively, though, that ""folks"" and ""everyone"" are both great gender neutral terms to address a group of people, because I use them both for that very purpose. Thanks again for asking for our input on being more inclusive! There are a lot of cis people out there who don't think about this at all, so what you're doing is very much appreciated. ❤️
Same to you my love. Wish you nothing but the best💕 thank you again💕💕😭
Who said I wanted to produce eggs???? I don’t want no fucking kids LOL
So kind beautiful,but you've made my day,just being able to see such beauty,sexy,luscious woman like yourself I'm smiling just thinking of you
i was going to keep being silly, but your relentless spirit made me smile and giggle
I still need to get into old horror movies, the original blob is my personal favorite!
I’m learning not be be upset at myself or anyone else for mistakes (so long as intent was good) - that’s how we learn :-)

I’m learning that only being open to feedback and changing behavior matters. 

If there was mal-intent, then I have learned to just avoid that person. 

Does that work for you?
Just seen your replies and thank you so much for the reassurance💕💕💕💕 I will definitely be wayyyyyy more cautious and really think of what I say cause the last thing I want to do is offend anyone💕💕💕 I want everyone to feel loved and beautiful. Thank you for understanding and being kind💕💕💕💕

Makes me feel better :) just hoping I didn’t offend anyone
Aww, you're very welcome. 😊 It's definitely a good thing to be mindful of how certain words could potentially trigger dysphoric reactions for our trans & non binary siblings, but I'm sure it won't be an issue since your intentions are wholesome & pure. Your concern is still very sweet, though, and I hope you have a great weekend. 💕

Thanks Mate!! I didn't even know it was a day, but Thank you!! It really means a lot to see someone celebrating us!!!!

Thank you!💚
thanks :)
Thanks
Omfg. Thanks. :D 

*insert I AM A MAANNNN meme*
Thanks, it's ended in my timezone
This is really nice, put a smile on my face lol. Thanks :)
Late to the post but happy Men's day!
I knew it was a day but I didn't know it was today
I've only been out as a trans woman for a month, so living as a man is still very fresh in my memory. Regardless of how much men in general are celebrated in society, before coming out, I wanted to be celebrated, I wanted to be loved. Praising some other dude's achievements meant nothing to me. It didn't need to be much. Sometimes just a hug was enough to remind me that I was still seen. So this is just a big digital hug for all the guys who need one. :) Glad I could give you a smile. <3
<3 Everybody just needs a little love sometimes. Glad I could make your day a little brighter. Keep being a badass.
Woot! Congrats!
what he said
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.

I have checked 378,298,881 comments, and only 82,508 of them were in alphabetical order.
<3 Glad to hear it!
well the other trans men then, not everyone is like him ya know
Well the good news is that you're still awesome. :)
At the end of trans awareness week too! A perfect time for us to celebrate trans guys and their respective journeys. Not that we should need a reason to do that, but you know what I mean.
Lol good bot

It’s trans awareness week? Lol I seriously need to get a calendar

I can't believe it (mtf 16, hrt since 15)	"I went to the bathroom at school and there were these girls standing there, and they were like ""oh my god youre so incredibly pretty, youre like a goddess."" And I'm almost certain they had no clue I was trans.

I'm so happy and relieved!!
I just had to share"	"Enjoy the euphoria :)
That’s amazing!! 🤩
Gender euphoria is a high cis people can never know. Congratulations, young sister! 🤗🤗🤗
I'm so jealous but incredibly happy for you and the coming generations that will grow up under more educated environments. Gives me hope!!
Damn you can go in the girls bathrooms in school. That shocked me more that the validation you got i'm happy for you ^^
(I'm not allowed to do that so that's why it suprised me)
That’s awesome!

Which country?

The hope and the dream of all of us!

Wait your 16 and have been on hrt since 15 ??? Omgg I’m 17 and I want to start but I haven’t taken any steps….or anything. If it’s alright with you … how was the process? Could u walk me through it?
Thanks for sharing.
Your are a lucky girl! Enjoy it...looking to the pics you posted a few days ago, what should they say...you are a goddess, a beautiful one

You show how important it is to start full transition as early as possible.

Love Tanja

Idk my Country is pretty shitty with trans laws and school. The only Real explanation i got was when i was in a conversation with my teacher and he mentioned ""well you know... because...(while gesturing at me)""
And that was about the end of the conversation there because i didn't really want to talk anymore. So now i am always supposed to go while classes are going on so that i don't meet anyone in the baths. Luckily i almost never have to go to the baths so it's ok i guess
Hey I mean, that place is like a whole different country compared to the US.
“What country?” “Florida” lovely /t
welp i’m sorry to inform you but you have a severe case of the pretties and you are indeed pretty :T lol. don’t worry girl, you are doing great, good luck with life and everything :)"	s8mrne	trans	1230	0.99	2022-01-20 16:25:41

Seeing people so happy being who they really are and all of the love and support in the comments is why I keep coming around here.

There's a brand of hair colour we get here in Australia called ""Color Lux"", idk where you live but if you can get that brand I 100% recommend it!

They have amazing colour, and they have a conditioner range so every time I wash my hair I also re-dye it 😊 works amazingly!!

Good luck! Please update with pics if you try it! ❤️
I love it

Coming Out and Cutting Off	"On January 23rd, 2022, I came out to my parents. I had written them a letter a couple of weeks beforehand and put it in my room. I told my mother where to find it. I was at a friend's apartment, near my college.

I didn't speak to her for about another week. The first person I spoke to was my Grandmother, who lives with my parents. She wasn't happy. Neither was my Dad. There was a lot of yelling, a lot of anger, and a lot of pain that day, while I attempted to explain everything to them calmly. I've never been one to get angry.

The days went by, and things slowly calmed down. My Grandma, who had said she didn't want to talk anymore, began to call every day again (multiple times daily), and my Dad called occasionally. I even spoke to my Aunt, who wanted to be the ""mediator"" between me and my Mom.

And then. They asked me to go home. And I agreed.

I was treated with the worst weekend of my entire life.

&#x200B;

The ride home with my Mom was painful. We argued for a bit, invalidating my gender, saying she'd only ever love \*dead name\*. We ate and continued to argue. I never raised my voice. I wasn't raised to do that. The rest of the ride home was silent. I never looked at my phone, I just looked forward as the time ticked down. I didn't rest my eyes, nor did I ask to go to the bathroom despite my bladder screaming at me. I didn't want her berating me for not feeling up to go into the Women's restroom yet.

When we got home, I brought my stuff up to my room. My Grandma had asked to see my HRT, so I took 1 of both pills I take to her. My Mom found the rest and took it, calling me a liar and receptor for even trying to keep it. I went to bed shortly after.

When I got up, my Grandpa wanted to take me to his priest. It wasn't the worst experience in the world, he didn't yell, say I was going to hell, or even say it was a sin. He wanted to ""guide"" me through this. We ate, got home, and then, it was my Dad's turn.

He took me to my Grandfather and Uncle's graves. Both died before I was born. He told me about how proud his Grandfather was of him getting married, and how wanted to feel the same for me. I said he could. He said it wouldn't be the same. He said he wanted to continue his family's name and legacy. I said I could, with adoption. He said it wouldn't be the same. He then took me to see my Grandma. He hadn't told her and left it up to me. I didn't say anything.

We got home. My mom made dinner, and we ate. Afterward, my Grandma encouraged me to speak with my Mo, or she wouldn't speak to me. I wanted to keep her, so I did. It quickly went awry. She took my phone and began reading chat logs, seeing how I spoke to people, now my friends, at my college's PRIDE club. She had already thought I was brainwashed, and this cemented it in her mind. I knew I was trans before I met them, however.

My mom and dad began reacting horribly. They wanted legal action done against my friends, the club, the school, Plume (where I get my HRT). They threatened to get my close friend expelled and fired. Thye began posting things online calling them cultists indoctrinating their child and ""warning"" parents of the threat. My dad sent emails to the heads of the PRIDE club, threatening them if they ever spoke to me again.

My dad threatened to beat me. He said he didn't know if he'd be able to stop himself from killing me if he started.

Both wanted to attack any of my friends if they saw them.

and...

&#x200B;

My dad threatened to shoot my close friend.

&#x200B;

They continued reading chat messages. They were now getting to my high school friends, who I had come out to and who supported me. They started to insult and threaten them too.

My mom began to threaten not to take me back to my dorm. To not let me go back to classes. I had to say things I didn't mean in order to convince her to let me get out of that house.

I went to bed. My dad later told me that as he continued to read my messages, (which he now had access to on his computer because he asked for my Discord password) he wanted to enter my room and beat me while I was asleep.

When I finally got back to campus, my Mom forced me to take my box of feminine items in my dorm down to their car. And then, they left.

&#x200B;

It took me a while to respond to any of my friends. They were incredibly worried about me. I told them I was doing okay, and about everything that had occurred. 

I began formulating a plan of what to do.

My friends had already reported my dad to campus safety. The things I told them were just the icing on the cake.

They got me a prepaid phone. The one I had had Life360 on it, and I wasn't sure how much else they had access to.

I informed my Calculus professor, whose class I had an exam in on the day I planned to confront them. He allowed me to delay it.

I spoke to campus officers, lawyers, to about everyone I could without my parents knowing. They were watching me like a hawk, unfortunately.

During this time, my parents drained my bank account, which was jointly owned. They also informed me that they knew I had another prescription for my HRT filled, and they would be forcing me to pick it up and give it to them.

The plan was for me to confront them. A parent's weekend was coming up, wonderful timing. My friends notified the school of my plan. They would be prepared in case anything happened.

And the day came.

&#x200B;

I got up early, and got ready, watching Life360 as my parents drive down. Luckily, it went both ways. We met up briefly before classes began. I told them I loved them.

When classes were over, I went to our Student Union. Many people, students parents, faculty, security would be there. I'd be safe. My parents came to meet me.

I gave them an ultimatum. They either accept me, give me back my money, stop threatening me and my friends, or I cut them off. My mother gave me a counter ultimatum. There was one option in both that matched.

We continued to argue. I told them I didn't deserve the things they did. They said they had the right to do them. She asked for ""her"" phone. I handed it right to her. She said I was her son. I told her I was her daughter. She walked away.

My dad continued to speak with me for a bit. He said he didn't agree with her taking my phone, and that he didn't ""mean"" any of the threats he made. He was just angry. He asked me if visiting his father and brother's graves meant nothing to me. I said it did, but it didn't change who I was. I hugged him, and he left after my mother.

It has since been a day. I was able to spend the rest of that day with my friends, dressing up how I want, getting my HRT back, changing my passwords to accounts they had, and watching Queer Eye. I had never actually watched it before. It was nice.

&#x200B;

The strange thing is, I feel as though I should have a sense of grief. I will miss my family, I will miss my Grandma, and I will miss my Niece and Nephew. But I think I already accepted losing them as a possibility before I even came out. So, I expected it, and it's what I got. I already went through my grief.

From now on, my life will be harder. I won't be supported by my family, I will have to do my own financial aid for college, I will have to do everything on my own. And maybe I am not ready for it. But I will try. I will be the person my parents thought I couldn't be. I will go through life as myself, unapologetically. Because I have spent the past 18 years incapable of doing so, suppressing myself and my emotions, being the perfect little child, who does no wrong.

&#x200B;

My life will be harder. But it also shines so much brighter. And I cannot wait to keep living it."	"This sounds like an absolute horror show. Your parents could and should be charged for stealing your medication and for making threats of violence. I hope you are well.
It took a ton of strength to make those steps and you were right to defend yourself!
Thank you so much for posting this, and you know we are here for you. Reading this was almost therapeutic for me, as I can relate to most everything and it shows that even if everything goes wrong, its still possible to make it.
I realized my identity just over a month ago, at the end of my first semester in college. I realize my suppression had been preventing me from really connecting with people, and im still trying to figure out how to get friends who would accept me if I came out to them.
This kind of confrontation takes the strength that not many have. I am happy that you are currently safe, and I wish you luck on your journey. This story is the biggest thing I am personally afraid of happening and that is why I am waiting till I graduate. Hiding it is tough, but it is even more badass to live your life as yourself. When it comes to providing for yourself, depending on your major you could look around for some entry internships. Or look into possible scholarships to apply for. Depending on how high your tuition is will change the difficulty of the whole process. If you have more internships than is necessary for your tuition and any other administrative expenses you will get that money refunded to you. Good luck girl, we are all cheering for you.
Did they ever return the money they stole?
It's amazing how mature of a person you are! I wouldn't be so delicated as you were, personally.
They don't deserve you, they sound like disgusting human being frankly, and long term you will be better of without them. You are string, doing this. Be proud
Proud of you, keep it up 💜
Am I the only one who thinks you should run to the cops and tell them your parents threatened your friends life just because you're trans?
You are so brave.
I'm a stranger and this shouldn't mean anything to you
but I am proud of you for stepping up to your parents.

I wish you all the best and joy with your new won freedom:)
Resonated with a lot in your story. Shit birth family here as well. Stay strong! Remember you can make your family however you want! It doesn’t have to be your blood!
Exactly what I’m a afraid of when I go off to college and begin to transition.

Honestly you are so brave and you did the right thing by cutting out your family; if they want you back in their then they need to realize they have to make peace with who you are.

Good luck your are braver than I good lady.
Walk your own path, make your own family   


I don't have supportive family, me and my mum pretty much openly hate each other - unless someone is around then she tries to play nice ofc.  
Rest of family is abroad and I have no contact with them, I came out to them though.  
They don't understand it or accept it, but they do want me to be happy - therefore I told them one thing I must do is cut myself from the past, because I won't be able to heal from trauma.

I need love and support, I only started HRT lately and I just have a mindset of a teenage girl, who is beyond her wisdom for her age.

The way I counterpart loneliness and trauma from not so great family is building my own circle of friends, who treat me with respect for who I am.  
When I am surrounded by such people, I am able to be honest, emotional, more loving and I will grow as a person, that I am transitioning to.
I get the feelings what they did should be labeled abuse. None of that was ok, by any metric.
We cannot choose our gender or who we love, but we CAN choose who we call our ""family"". For some of us this is easier said than done, but Im glad you found the support and strength to be true to who you are.

Also, on a brighter note, Queer Eye is an excellent pick-me-up for any occasion.
Yeah. This is why I sent my parents a letter and then just never talked to them again.
I'm so incredibly sorry for you. And I know that this might happen to me too. So I'm cutting them off emotionally at the moment to feel stronger when that happens.
Thanks for sharing. I'm expecting the same of my parents in about a month, so your experience really hits home. You are better off and you have a bright future ahead of you. The best thing to do is to continue to be and become who you were meant to be. Get into a field that you love and live a life worth envying. It's their loss that they chose not to be part of that.

Lots of love sis. You are so awesome. <3
Dear god, I’m so sorry you had to go through all that. I don’t know if I would have had the resilience you did. Stay strong girl, you’ve gotten this far, nothing can stop you now.
Your parents sound like they would be great friends with mine. I was cut off last summer, tried to let my mom back in a few months ago, and ultimately went no contact. 

Mine didn’t have as much access to abuse me as yours did. I came out as a married adult, post college. But they still paid for my phone service. They got rid of that eight months ago. I still don’t have cell service. 

It’s hard, but I resonate with you saying you already mourned them, in a sense. 

Much love to you girl, you have a fantastic life ahead of you.
You seem like an amazingly composed and compassionate person. I wish I could give you a round of applause and a massive hug at the same time. Whoever you choose to be your friends and family from now on are so lucky to have you!
This is why Im not planning to have any discussion with my family Once I transit, I will just cut them of. Its better that way. Im sorry OP for what happened to you. Also you was very brave.
This post is written like someone is dissociating while writing it. That kind of experience is extremely traumatizing. I hope you’re okay. Please talk to a therapist as soon as you can. Your campus should have services available.
I'm proud of you. Abusive parents suck and you did the right thing here. Never go back, you worked hard to get here, to a place where you can be yourself.
That sounds like an absolute shitshow, i'm really sorry you had to go through that ☹️ but you have friends and an environment that loves and accepts you so that's a major plus. And you have us as well 😊 stay strong girl, and stay safe
I'm sorry these awful ideas got into your family's head. The things people will do when they're scared or angry, over something that doesn't warrant it. I don't know how you kept your cool. That must have been so hard. 

I hope you make out okay, I'll be thinking about you Sister. They didn't give you a choice, you tried.
this is horrifying but I'm so glad you're safe now. you're an incredibly strong young woman, you should be proud for coming out and proud for standing up against them. with support from people who actually accept you you'll grow even stronger and more wonderful. never forget that, never deny who you are
I am so sorry for all that you have had to go through and in the end all of this will make you stronger and now you can truly be your happy self the way you feel and the way you are.
As I was reading this I swear I had hand tremors from trying not to punch these parents ngl.
I know how you're feeling. I've definitely been in a very similar situation a long time ago and those very same events I've never forgotten. 10 years later on down the line with years hrt and many years of effort and dedication and I pass really well, I don't live in a dangerous environment anymore. I have so many friends willing to put others before themselves in this community. It did get easier and I hope that it does for you. The only advice I can really think of right now is to make things as easy as possible for yourself in future by having backup plans and backup plans for those backup plans because people who don't understand tend to find ways to hurt us / upend those plans sometimes without even meaning to.
For one, this is triggering, bot just ""possibly triggering"" seccond, why did you just like.. let your family take all of your stuff? From what i hear you are a grown woman in college so you shouldn't have any incentive to stay or to let them go through your private stuff on your phone or give your dad your discord password, third, IF YOUR DAD IS THREATENING TO KILL YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS THEN CALL THE FUCKING POLICE!! Like what??
You are one of the strongest people, I wish I could hug you. *Hugs*
There is you and there is the *idea* of you. You are the former; your parents “loved” the latter.
I’m so sorry you had to go through this sweetie! I have difficult parents but nothing like this. Not even close. I just want to say how strong and brave you are little flower, and that while it is sad, you have a truly shining path ahead to realize your full potential as the beautiful woman you are. Much love from a fellow trans sister ❤️
Some people are horrible people. No one should have to experience what you just did. 

As I am also a parent, were one of my kids to leave me a letter… I would honestly feel bad for not making them feel safe to tell me in person. In person because I would want to hug them, tell them I loved them… right there,  right then. Let them know I would fight for them. 

Those people don’t deserve any more of your time. 

Small piece of advice just in case…

Take what you’ve written here. Add to it, add details, who was present what approximate time things happened… get and include case number from campus security. Get info for everyone you talked to. make sure you can tell the entire story. Because you may need to take legal action (saw that you were waiting for that ‘one more thing’ these people sound quite capable of continuing.
<hugs> ❤️
I'm sorry for your family of violent criminals. I hope they get what they deserve if you wish to report them and I'm sure your friends will be there to support you I stead of your family.
Don't feel sorry for leaving them, the things they've done to you could get you into jail in my country.
You are so brave and such a beautiful person. Sending you some 💕
As someone who also has unsupportive parents, and is going off to college in a year or so, this is heartbreaking to read. Scary, even. But seeing someone show so much bravery and stand up for herself in this way is so so powerful and im glad I took the time to read it. You are so strong, and I am sending you all the well wishes and good luck that I can. You're strong, beautiful, and we're all cheering you on!!
Welcome to your newfound freedom. I've been there before, and trust me: none of the upcoming challenges compare to the crippling weight of abusive parents. You'll be okay. You've got this.
Jesus Christ what a shit show. I'm 45 and horrified at this story. Life will be hard but way better than what they did to you. You are obviously a strong woman and many people including me couldn't have handled that as well as you did. Maybe one day they'll come around but it will be on your terms if you want to forgive them (you don't have to)you go girl!!! Also you should sue them for the trauma they caused
It’s been a pleasure getting to know you and watch you grow, and I’m so proud! - Max
You're a strong woman, you know that right? Not everyone could stand their ground like that in such a situation, yet you did, as you said life will be hard now, but finally you can start living it as yourself, much love!
Whew that sucks. But also, you sound like an absolute badass. I cannot imagine the strength it must have taken to go through all of this. That you still retain a positive outlook is amazing. Keep spinning, girl.

(Also, if you haven't watched it yet, I recommend seeing the Matrix).
I am very proud of you for standing up to yourself and basically everyone involved in helping you out! You all did great in such a stressful situation!
You're amazing. Always remember that the authentic you will always handle any situation better than the fake you they want you to be ever would.
Ngl, I think you should throw the book at them. This barbaric behavior needs to start hurting these people.
Yeah okay your family fucking sucks, I'm your new mom or dad or whatever the fuck you need lol you are an amazing human being and you are a valid trans person! Now go have a great rest of your day, you incredible young lassie and always know that this community (and I) will be here for you whenever you need!!
It does get brighter! I’m worse off financially, too, but I’ve been doing much better mentally/emotionally and it gets better! ❤️
You are going to do great. Keep that determination and remember most of the people you find and bring close will have your back more than family ever does. ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb""
wow... just wow. I'm so heartbroken for reading all of that. I want you to know that you have all of my support, love, affection and time if you want to talk anytime, even if you want a new friend. I'm not doing as bad as you but I too am planning to escape from home this september (that's when I will turn 18) and be myself, because at my place my parents think it's a phase and my mother is very strict about how I act when she's not looking.

I am really really REALLY sorry that you had to go through everything I've just read (and more things that you probably didn't write which I respect too) but I know deep inside it will be worth it, I know that you will be able to move forward and be who you aspire to be.

I just would love to hug you right now and to tell you that everything will be okay but as I think that we live quite far from each other I'll just send you this, hope for you to read it and say that I love you, that you're valid and that I'm sending a virtual hug.

Lots of love honey, take amazing care of yourself and stay strong, you're doing great and you will be happy. <3
You did so well! I’m very proud of you 💜👍
What a painful experience. Just wish I could hug you. I'm so sorry your family treated you to that abuse.
You are so incredibly strong and brave. I started reading this post and had to put it down several times before I could make it all the way through it. What you went through and what they did and said both infuriated me and made me incredibly sad all at once. I’m so sorry. I’m glad that you’re ok though. So your research like you said in response to one of the comments. Do your research and speak with lawyers or councilors, maybe even something like campus police. Find out exactly what your rights are and what they can/cannot do or force you to do. I’m not sure where you are located but I’m pretty sure if you’re 18 then they have no legal bearing over you at all. I’m not saying press charges or anything either, that’s something only you can decide on. I am saying though, to know your rights to protect yourself from them trying anything else. Please stay safe. I’m glad that you have a good supportive group of friends.
Wow thats alot sorry
I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. But I am proud of you for standing up for yourself, impressed with your resourcefulness and happy that you have friends who will support you.
You deserve all the best, and you have the patience of a saint for not getting angry with them.
I wish you the best of luck and happiness, going forward!
Well... I’m so sorry for you😭😭😭

You can be SUPER SUPER proud of yourself💜, for how you’re dealing with this difficult situation.

Hang in there, things will get better eventually...
Wow. I'm sorry girl. No one should have to deal with that kind of extremely transphobic parents. I thought my parents were acting really bad but here you're coming back from hell.

I understand very much about this kind of grief. After several months of arguing about me being trans, I decided to cut off with mine last week too. I will definitely miss them, especially the ones they were before I came out.

I'm 1000% with you.
I think the most frustrating parts of these stories for me is hearing all the abuse and then ending with “those rascals, I’m not gonna make them face repercussions for their actions but I’m not happy with what they’ve done”. Ik it’s family and all but people need to understand that things have consequences and legal ramifications, you can’t withhold someone’s medication from them legally and threatening someone with physically harm is a serious crime that shouldn’t be brushed off. I’m guilty of doing this as well with the whole “one more thing, that’ll be my breaking point” but then things calm down and the next thing doesn’t quite hit your breaking point so it slides and then accumulates and you end up with an abusive shit show. If my siblings wouldn’t be split up and sent to equally abusive “fathers” ide have my mother in prison for life with the amount of shit I have on her, so I understand there’s nuance but op if there isn’t anything truly stopping you, you should seek legal advice in one way or another or atleast get a restraining order
Damn I just have no word to describe this it just seems so out of this world for parents to act like this i know I shouldn't be saying that but and im sorry for what im about to say but ETF IS WRING WITH ARE THEY FUCKING INSANE ACTING LIKE FUCKING DRAMA QUEEN BITCH WTF . More seriously I hope your doing fine by yourself and now that you're free enjoy your oife and be yourself.
This is one of the only things that I read on the internet that actually gave me goosebumps and made me scared for op.
Omg.
You should not be missing that awful, awful family of yours! Such a horror show...

In fact, your ""parents"" should have been charged with prescription medication theft and child abuse!

Just want to wish you well, sweetie. You're a girl and that's what matters.
I know that they can. I've done a lot of research and stuff into what they could be charged with, and it's a fair amount.

I don't intend to do anything to them at the moment though, unless they force my hand. They could do that by trying to ruin my life more than they have by like suing me, or attempting to take the stuff in my room.

On a more lighthearted note, my friends and I had been talking about what they might be able to take from me if they tried, and I joke they may try to take my fridge they had gotten me.

The two things my Mom said she wanted were my phone and my fridge.

My fucking fridge. Not my $1000 laptop, or my Switch, or anything else I have.

My fridge.

It was so ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh at it with my friends once it was over.
Thanks!

It hasn't been easy, but I have a lot of very good friends supporting me through this. I really owe it all to them.
Hey! I get that. I really didn't put myself out there for a very long time. My high school friend group is only there because I was friends with one guy since middle school, and then a friend of his came in, and then a friend or two of hers, etc.

I'd suggest seeing if your campus has a PRIDE club of some kind. You can get some great friends thereto are almost certain to accept you for yourself. It can be tough to put yourself out there as your authentic self though, and I get that. My first club meeting, I didn't even say my name, or talk to anyone.

But over time, you may begin to loosen up. Tell them your name, maybe even dress as yourself. The first time I went out in public as myself was with them, to a PRIDE event. It's exciting to be yourself, so, all I can say is to try. Go at your own pace of course, but don't let it go ignored.
Yeah, financial stuff is gonna be a bit hard. Luckily, someone in our group recently went through a tough time with parents, and he's supposedly done a bunch of research into financial aid and stuff, and is willing to help out.

I also intend to look into internships, or at least a job of some kind. While my living expenses for the semester are covered (housing by dorm, and food by meal plan) I still have to worry about paying for HRT and stuff.

Tuition is quite high for my college (50k-ish), though I currently have 2 main scholarships covering like 35k each semester as long as I keep a decent GPA. The rest is a bit of an issue, but I've been researching scholarships, and now especially intend to go into them.
That's possible, but remember what the cops have done in the US. I don't trust the police. A lawsuit is a better option...
They don't have a case to sue you with. They're textbook abusive, breaking several laws, and if you throw the book at them (or vice versa) you are going to win.
Are you a minor? Refuse. If you're a minor get emancipated. This is insane. Stop doing what they say, stop giving them passwords. Go change all your passwords right now. Stop giving them access to anything..just refuse. And do not go back. You need to get help through LGBT groups for young people. Their are groups that help out up to mid 20s.
Ah, yes, the most.... Actually, stealing your fridge would be a pain in the ass for you, I was going to make fun of it but honestly that would be one weird power move
Yeah time for new parents.
Don't sell yourself short - your friends are backing the strength they see in you.

This was a tough read, and you're in a tough situation. 

But you got this. Stay strong...
I'm lucky the college I go to has a PRIDE club...
Make sure you check prices against GoodRX and CostPlus Pharmacy if you're in the US (which is what I'm assuming) because they may help bring the cost of your HRT wayy down.
If you haven't already and you're in the US and 25 or under, talk to your school's financial aid department to start paperwork for financial independence. Just let them know you've been cut off. This will have them reassess your financial obligation and can result in a significant increase in financial aid.

Good luck. It's so hard. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.
I know in my area they sheltered a trans masc from his family and friends who basically ganged up to kill him over nonsense. It's worth a shot
You're right.
In addition to this great advice…

You can call your HRT provider and ask if they are willing to move you to a more inexpensive option.  Most providers are acutely aware of the challenges that the cost of medications pose to patients, and they know a few tricks."	slqvog	trans	1206	0.99	2022-02-06 07:21:51
Happy trans day of visibility to y'all	remember that you are all valid no matter what other people say <3	">!If I may, I'd like to request to be less visible. Thank you!<

Woooo! 🏳️‍⚧️🌟
And you know what I'm doing to celebrate it? I'm transitioning!
The one day a year we get to not be invisible
Has anyone seen the news? Biden declared it a holiday yesterday, and conservative media is flooding misinformation throughout the internet. When you put “trans day” into google, the auto fill is now “trans day of vengeance” and “trans day of rage”. I’m really upset about this honestly. Like how could they just turn this around on us so easily.
To you too. Sadly, I gotta see a relative I'm not ready to come out to yet, so I gotta spend half the day not being visible. Gonna wear a new dress after, though!
Woooo! At my school I did pride coloured eye shadow for people, and the queer club at my school handed out pins and cupcakes (:
Currently spending my day boymoding in the airport, but I have a pin, so it's something.
You too. Unfortunately I'm stuck in country where general population is anti-trans and transphobic so not much visibility day for me.. Hope rest of y'all having a good day though.
Hey Peeps! Be visible, be safe, be happy!!
Thank you!! Reminder that you don't need to medically transition or go on hormones to transitiom<33 I feel like it's not talked about enough or remembered that some people simply don't want to medically transition or go on hormones, and on this day I want people like me to be seen as well
I have been worried but wanting to tell most of my family recently. Now seems like a good time. Hope everyone is good about it but if not then they don’t get to be family anymore 🤷🏻‍♀️
I would be more visible…if my dress wasn’t coming next week
Wait, I missed it again!????

trans day of visibility? no. please do not percieve me. i may be trans but i wanna be invisible
Thank you!
I got torn apart at work today I work at a nursing home and I came out while working there and had two large groups arguing whether or not I'm a real woman. Had me hiding in the bathroom, because after that I don't want to show my face again. I loved this job till I came out, but now I'm searching for a new job
Thank you ❤ most important day xx
Thanks!
I’m unapologetically MTF at the restaurant I work at. Dare them to say something
Came out to my boss and half my direct reports over teams at work today, they were supportive.... A bit nerve wracking. Hey do it's trans day of visibility. Do you know anyone that's trans? No? Well you know me....
thank you! 🏳️‍⚧️
The only reason I knew it was today was because of my mother celebrating with me, which is pretty hilarious. We shall all return to being invisible now
Ya'll valid af. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
it’s great my injection day falls on today!
Congratulations everyone! I decided to come out on social media. Having a very good day
[removed]
Thanks! Happy trans visibility day to you too
Ohh my gosh that's so sweet!
Ty, really needed this
Hello brothers and sisters and non-binary siblings! I love you!
Happy TDoV to you too! I’m extra celebrating today because it’s also my 1 year anniversary of starting T :)
Woooo!
yay! still not coming out :(
Unfortunately my trans day of visibility was spent at my uncles birthday. With the extended family that I am not out to. Very ironic.
So you wanna be trans-parant? 🌚
Try not to let the bastards get you down today 💕
congrats, dawg
Luckyyyyyyy. Nah. I’m just happy for you!
Congratulations! 🎉
Congrats!
congrats 🎉 I'm so happy for you <3
Gods damn do I wish I could have started today. Congrats though! May it go well and your life go fulfilled!
The one day we are not **trans**parent.
Trans day of vengeance is the name of a protest in D.C tomorrow, so that might also be skewing results.

Edit: vengeance protest has been canceled due to “credible threat to life and safety”
I just tried it out and it autofilled it as “...of visibility” for me.
that's totally fine, take your time, I'm sure your new dress will look beautiful <3
that's so cool, i love your school :))
If you manage to find a country that IS trans-friendly let me know.
I'm so sorry, maybe someday you'll move to a country that supports trans people :)
New Zealand is the best from what I’ve seen, if the UK gets worse I may escape there
exactly this, it's important that everyone is valid no matter if they are going to medically transitioning or not <33
you got this <33
No it’s today 3/31 unless you’re on the other side of the globe at which point yeah sorry :(
you still have time to celebrate it :))
I'm sorry that it went like that, if you wanna talk about it, my dms are always open <3
thats super nice to hear :))
maybe you're right and it's not a day to celebrate anymore. Do you think that i should delete this post? Because it was definitely not meant to make anyone uncomfortable/anxious.
r/angryupvote
As a parent of a trans child, can I also be ""trans-parent""?
Thanks! I'm excited! I hope you can experience the same
Pretty sure my parental unit is ALWAYS transparent.
Trans day of vengeance and trans day of rage is fundamentally about visibility
That’s good to hear 😊 I’m glad it changed throughout the day
People are saying Australia, New Zealand and Canada are pretty good options. Not sure though
The netherlands
Omg thanks! That's so sweet of you 💝
The day just started yeah, but I work thirds and just finished my Friday :( so I missed celebrating it at work
Thank you so much!
No. Keep it up. They don't get to take this away.
I appreciate it :D
Take my upvote and get the Fuck out
Although I do not feel qualified to answer that question I’d say go for it :D
Yes, you automatically are see through and a trans-parent
No because the ""treatments"" will sterilize you.
Yeah. Some day!
i plan to move to canada the second i graduate high school. i love the part of america i live in, but at the same time the country as a whole sucks, and seemingly its only getting worse with all the bills and shit getting proposed :(
Moving to Canada would be a good decision since I've heard Canada is a pretty safe place for trans people. Good luck in your journey! 👍🏻💝

so ive come out a couple times but never fully transitioned, the biggest hold up at this point is that i really want to be a musician and i’m scared how transitioning would affect that. hopefully i’ll have the courage to live full time as a female soon. happy pride everyone :)		"You’re gorgeous! Definitely don’t be afraid,
I still am because of my career too but you are beautiful
Fellow MTF musician, fucking DO IT (if you feel ready and want to.) My BEST performance (so far) was the one after I performed under my chosen name in femme. It's so liberating. 10/10 would recommend.  


Edit: I will say a few places I used to perform at haven't gotten back to me but the vibe was always weird there (yee yee etc) and I'm better off saving my energy for affirming venues.
[deleted]
Hi! You are a very talented musician whether you transition or not. But If you do decide to take that step I think it will open up a whole new world to you. A community of other trans musicians and an audience of people hungry for more queer representation in the music industry. I’m definitely a new fan now! Can’t wait to hear your future music!
Just wanted to say your looks show no sign of a lack of confidence. I believe transitioning for you should be easy as you already have the looks going for you. 

Don't be scared
Heyyyy, I may not be a musician but I know for a fact that trans women can have beautiful voices (indistinguishable from cis women). Just be yourself, thats all that rly matters.
There are lots of transgender musicians, and famous singers like Kim Petras.  Being authentic liberates you in so many ways... and my IT career has really taken off since I embraced my true self.  Anything new to this degree is going to make you fearful, but when you embrace who you are without reservation, then anything becomes possible!
This is kind of eerie to me because you look like a much younger version of my aunt. I mean no offense by this but it’s like you’re her clone.
you remind me so much of Allison Argent from teen wolf, you're so pwetty <3 I wanna look this amazing one day
In the same exact boat as you. Hang strong ♥️
Take all the time you need! I know it can be scary to transition. And you are gorgeous, btw. 😉
I completely 100% relate. However i realized one day that i couldnt actually invision myself become a male anything but i could instead see a future for myself as a female. So i started hrt like 8 months ago and my propensity for procrastinating has almost disappeared. 


Good luck finding your future girl. 💜💙💜
Stay strong you’re gorgeous btw!
Obviously do whatever you need to for you, we all have different pathways through life. That being said, while I have experienced pushback since coming out, none of if it has been work related. In fact, as a larger group, the people I've played with, recorded with/for etc have probably been the most supportive group. Happy Pride!
Beautiful!
She’s gorgeous!!
Look at Ezra Furman. She's doing great. Or Laura Jane Grace. Music will help you spread your wings
Take the advice of an older person; disregard fear and make the leap! Follow your dreams they are greater than regret! GO! Go you! 🏳️‍⚧️
I’ve known a ton of very talented, gorgeous tramsfem musicians. Most notably in my area (Ohio) is Lisa Bella Donna. She’s a genius. Fuck the music scene that’s too full of toxic masculinity and gross men gatekeeping. It’s up to us to change it. I personally only felt comfortable coming out as non-binary because I was involved in the queer music scene and was encouraged to come out by other musicians.
Can't wait to see a beautiful transgender woman take the music industry by storm!! Try listening to some queer artists (""Madam"" by eyeamki changed my life) to find inspiration!! Even if you can't ever have a voice that is as high as some Afab folx or Cis women, there is a market for women with deep voices! Androgenous voices are totally awesome, too, (""Electric"" by Miki Ratsula) and there is actually a much bigger queer community in music than it seems at first glance!!! Good luck cutie!!!!
[removed]
You got this. You’ll be the next Joan Jett
cute😊❤🤗
I’m a mtf trans musician! It’s totally good actually! There’s so much extra range that you can reach with practice as a vocalist, and trans musicians usually get extra attention just based off their identity. I think people like my music for it’s merit, but it’s good to have people pay attention to you right off the bat!
That hair looks so good on you! You’re absolutely beautiful and I wish you the best 😊
there r at least a dozen of us dw
Please don't be afraid to be a trans musician, you look cool as hell and trans representation is needed
you’re beautiful!!!
You are so pretty :0
U look like makoto from persona 5!
you look great girl!
Same here, I want to be a musician but I'm ftm, I personally don't think it's going to matter that I'm trans, and either way I try to not worry about that because music is everything for me, and if I start thinking about not transitioning because of my music, I think I'll start feeling more negatively about my music, and that's the last thing I want.
Arca, SOPHIE (whilst she was still alive), Galen Tipton, Lotic, Angel Ho, Tami T, bottoms, Fire-Toolz, Machine Girl, Kim Petras, Lyra Pramuk, Yves Tumor, or Swan Meat,  - are all amazing trans fem or non binary/genderqueer musicians of varying amounts of fame.  

this basically just turned into a list of recommendations for trans musicians but there are honestly so many amazing trans artists out there and that’s not to say anxieties aren’t valid but i think you will find the place and scene you are comfortable in, it might take some time but the spaces exist!!
That really should not hold you back. As a musician myself I needed to be absolutey true to myself to be able to present myself as my  true self. If know one can that's their problem x
My first thought is that because you’re an artist/musician that it’s absolutely crucial to your craft that you are vulnerable and honest in your work, especially if you’re a solo gig or the lead musician or something. I think that trying to hide or conceal major parts about you will show up in your performance. In contrast, if you were to be your authentic self for your audience, I think that would help you to connect to each other greatly & win over more fans, whether they’re queer/trans or not. 💕
*paniccc* I LOVE YOUR HAIR STYLE I WANTTTT
Hey go for it! You'll feel better once you do and it'll be freeing :) happy pride lovely 💕
Thank you for coming out when I was able to see you are beautiful

aw thank you ☺️
As a fellow musician im glad to hear you say that :)  
my first gig is in september and i'm not sure yet if i should present femme by then. It's on a pretty big festival too :o
i feel that!! but yeah my bands instagram is @backroomportrait
Those are very inspiring words! :)
your aunt better be hot lol
THAT IS SUCH A BIG COMPLIMENT I GREW UP ON TEEN WOLF
Ew what is that comment
People dig that shit. Be yourself! I feel enabled to actually express myself and be raw/real. I’m in the folk/punk scene too so that helps.
I wouldn’t say my aunt is hot because that’s weird, but in her city in Brasil she was Queen of Carnival a couple of times.
sowwy, for some reason it didn't show me your comment until just now (thanks, reddit) but yeah, I always loved Allison so much, she was the mvp of teen wolf to me

For some reason, this post made me want to look up trans flag colored magic the gathering Commander decks.

... And I found a partner couple of a shaman that rides a flying blue shark that looks identical to the one in OP's picture.

I know what I'm doing today

Check my new post I tried your tips! Thank you!
Amazon of course! Ty! ❤️
Ty so much!
Same to you!
Ty ❤️
Thank you so much! 😊
On that note, I don’t know what brands are available to you, but if you can find a brand with more variety, you could try to find a slightly pinker tone. Your makeup looks good, and it’s not too light or anything. But it’s somewhat yellower than your skin seems to be. 

That said, your makeup is amazingly well done!
Of course! ☺️
Thanks! I'm gonna do that! The lady at ulta was helping me out with foundation but I think she kinda rushed me out of there.
Might be that. But also some brands have lighter or darker tones, but not different pigmentations.

One thing that might be good is to find a brand that works for you and sells online. Some might have skin tone quizzes and things like that. I’d point you to the one I use, but it’s a Brazillian brand, and I don’t think they ship elsewhere"	whnh9q	trans	1165	0.98	2022-08-06 12:44:22
I dont understand, why do people hate us so much	"I did the stupid thing of looking at JK Rowlingss twitter. I know it was a bad idea, and now I just feel like shit. I just dont understand, why do so many people hate us for seemingly no reason. You can counter every argument, point out every statistic that shows how transitioning is better for the mental health of trans people, and they still just falter back to ""its not natural"" or ""you're not going to be a real x"". It just frustrates me so much, theres no benefits to them being this mean, they're just making others lives harder, why are people like this, I just want to be happy, and yet these people seem to have it in mind that I cant try because I'll never be real or I'll never be pretty or its not natural. Then they create laws to make it harder for us to even live. Why, what's even the point."	"Because they've never had to live a single day like this.
It's prejudice and prejudice doesn't work on any rational level...
Because people are ignorant to anything which doesn't directly affect them as a person. If transphobes had to live as a trans person, they would be singing a different tune.
Making people confront the idea that humans are messy, irrational, emotional complicated and complex beings terrifies some people. These folk want simple. 

They want black/white, but get shades of grey. 

They demand up/down, but get somewhere in the middle 

They insist on yes/no. Instead, they get 'maybe' and that is deeply uncomfortable to a species that prizes stability, comfort and predictability.

This is likely why so many religions ""explain"" our existence and central place in an ""ordered"" universe that, scientifically, could care less about a speck of dust on a speck of dust in a backwater spiral of a backwater galaxy.
Society makes scapegoats out of any minorities they can. We are easy to blame, or a distraction from the real issues at hand. The hate exists through people's dissatisfaction with their own lives for whatever reason and they will find any reason, any 'differences' to create a 'logical' excuse to direct hate towards others. It's not about us at all, this has happened throughout history to many different groups of people. Not to get too philosophical but humanity is a hateful beast and will always find a way to purge it's anger and abuse on to the world where it can. I try to find the good in those around me and ignore the rest, I can't change it so I am choosing to live in my own bubble of acceptance ❤️
As a former Transphobic PoS, most of these people are either in the closet, or are so far right/conservative that anything that isn't straight is the devil. I hope that one day these people get what's coming to them, whether that be an awakening or a punch to the face
I always assumed non-LGBTQ people with very strong opinions about LGBTQ people are secretly closeted self-hating LGBTQ people.

JK Rowling once wrote something along the lines of ""I wish I was a man so I wouldn't have had to endure the abuse from my sexist father"" and that made me raise an eyebrow.
People hate what they can’t understand. So basically they’re too stupid realize how dumb they are.
The benefit for them is that they don't have to confront the fact that it makes them feel icky or weird. If you hear ""it's not natural"" as a reason.... translate that to ""it makes me feel weird."" Human existence is VERY VERY UNNATURAL. Flying through the air 10 miles above the ground is mach 0.8 is very unnatural. Virtually no one is trying to outlaw it because it is unnatural. Having a little bit on the wall that directs just the right amounts of lightning to just the right places is super unnatural. Again, no one seems to be giving up electricity because it is unnatural. Heck, walls and roofs are not naturally occuring. It is unnatural to NOT die of cancer. The natural state of a person with cancer used to be it killed them, almost every time, horrifically. Precious few people advocate dying of cancer because it is the natural thing. We use the best medical knowledge we have to be unnatural and NOT die of cancer because it improves lives. Equally we should use the best medical and social knowledge we have to help trans people's lives improve. If it is natural or not is a really worthless question.

I will add there is some evidence that being trans could be considered natural. But that is really not that relevant either. The key questions are about making the best lives for people of all types. Those folks won't even accept the evidence. Their position is based on feelings of not understanding or feeling weird about it.
I honestly think it’s because humans despise the fact that they can’t control so many things about themselves, their lives, their bodies etc. We chose control, despite all the social stigma that said not to and all the challenges that went with it, we took our destiny in our hands. That has always caused a fear/hate reaction in people. It’s why conservatives push against medical advances and new technologies. Why any scientist who challenges known theory or explores new things is ridiculed and outcast. Transphobia is an extension of that response.
Historically speaking being trans has never been supported much, but 2022 in America is definitely a lot better than 100 years ago. I’m in a liberal state so there’s not a ton of hate here. I’m a little biased
Jealousy. Period. We get put down, ignored, cast aside and belittled, and it all comes down to jealousy. We get to live our lives truely and authentically, from being able to find a name that fits us, wearing what we want, doing what we want and not be one bit apologetic. We aren't confined and defined, we are free, we get to spread our wings while they look up from their boxes and lines and it burns them inside that they're stuck on the ground. We fight, we work and we push to change the status quo, and we do it with pride.
Oh I am currently punishing myself with the Texas “child abuse” order. As a native it just keeps punching me in the gut. I feel your pain.
Did JK Rowling say something new?
Capitalism relies upon several super-structural divisions to maintain itself, gender is one of them, race is another. A piece of the patriarchal pie designed to uphold the ownership of private property by men. Men toil at work to make other men rich, women toil at home or at work for lesser pay, and queer people remain disposable and easily replaceable. 

Capitalism, and in particular JK Rowling's particular brand of liberalism relies upon everyone in society 'knowing their place' and not rocking the boat, so to speak. Our existence is a fundamental threat to the patriarchal order that has existed since we transitioned from primitive communism into slave societies- Living proof that many of the structures created to uphold our economic systems are ultimately arbitrary and not set in stone. I highly recommend Shaun's recent video on Harry Potter, he goes more in depth into it than I can.

I've found this (rather simplified) material understanding of the root of transphobia much more satisfying than the usual answers of ""They just don't understand."" tbh.
Also older people were told no you can’t be happy or different, so they take that unhappiness out on others 😔
They're afraid we'll corrupt their children and pollute their perfect religious world.  Honestly much of it is hatred bred from the top in order to continue political and religious control.  Fear and hate are powerful tools.
I am cis male. Plenty of people also love how brave y’all are. People are constantly referring to effeminate males as gay as an insult or acting like mtf trans people are not manly. Like, if you’re using manly as a substitute for tough, nothing tougher than an open trans person being who they wanna be. Nothing but respect for that. 
Unfortunately, politics uses y’all as fodder for the masses to get upset over while actual evil happens every day.
Some people don't understand, some people don't think they're being harmful, some people have these transphobic views so ingrained in their system that they can't get rid of them. And some people are genuinely disgusting and cruel.   
But it'll get better... Eventually.   
I just hope to live long enough to see it.
I watched a video analysing Harry Potter yesterday and I realised JK Rowling is actually much more of a bigot than I thought. I don't think she only has a problem with trans people, it's just that trans people are the unfortunate punching bag right now.
People don’t like change. Let alone having to follow yet another social norm. I honestly find it absolutely astounding that people won’t let others just live their lives-
literally the Bible is one of the biggest reasons

there’s a lot of cool Christians that i love with all my heart but the Bible contains so many verses like Deuteronomy 22:5 and people want that book to be the basis for government
Hate isn't logical. You will never reason someone out of a thought they never arrived at logically.
Cause we're hot 🥵
As long as people have attributes that make them different from one and other, there will be people that discriminate others based on one or more of those attributes that they deem not okay for whatever fucking reason.

What pisses me off is that it doesn’t effect them in any way. Like, does someone being happy in their own damn skin REALLY make you loose sleep at night? Because if it does, you need to rethink yourself.
They fear us the same way some white people fear black people. People fear what they don’t know or understand.
Recently? The homophobes lost their battle against the gays, so they've directed their hate towards transpeople. They use the same arguments they did during the gay marriage debates and focus on transfeminine people the same way they did gay men.
I left twitter because they were so vocal and awful, and couldn't stop looking at it, but they are a hateful minority and just very loud (and unfortunately powerful in government and media), but the majority of regular people seem to be with us, which is heartening. The [TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Texas! Bundle](https://itch.io/b/1308/ttrpgs-for-trans-rights-in-texas) has made nearly $307K in less than a week, which is just one tiny example of support. 

Hate is non-sensical and rejects reason. Hopefully more will come round, but we and our allies will keep fighting.

Love and solidarity! xx
humans instinctively fear something out of their expectations and something different. it's encoded in our survival instincts. that's the science of it anyway. no excuse for keep hating on us tho. because humans can get used to new things.
Its ignorance. People usually fear things they dont understand, and are less likely to accept someone because of their differences. The worst kind are those who are closed minded and stubborn. I would just ignore them toxicity isnt healthy for anyone.
IN MY OPINION Because they believe “different” means bad. People aren’t born knowing everything they are thought. And most people don’t understand trans people (from what I’ve seen at least. Since It’s not thought in schools or anywhere so it makes sense). Someone formed this stupid thought to think that we were wrong since we were weird, because they couldn’t understand us otherwise. And then they started telling other people who didn’t understand transgender people either. And then those people started to think the same because that’s the only explanation they have. And unfortunately unless they start to realize that there is no problem with being different and they were wrong for thinking that, they won’t (we’re usually the people who have to advocate for ourselves and make them realize how they’re wrong). Fortunately, there are still some good people who don’t think this way. The majority isn’t that transphobic but mostly just confused and uneducated (again at least from what I’ve been able to tell). IMO that’s why education on trans topics is so important because then they will so easily take the idea that we’re wrong and will latch into that hate.
I don't understand how we live in an ""accepting/equal"" modern society, while people will still act like primitive enigmas, who still live in a prejudice era of history. It's so messed up...
I'm privileged to be a ""passing"" trans woman. When I tell people that I am trans they always say something like ""I would never have known!"" I am so sick of that. But despite that, I tell everyone about my transness if I'm around them for more than a few conversations. My goal is to expose as many people as possible to a trans person because I believe lack of exposure is the main cause of bias and discrimination against us. If they can see me as a normal human being, maybe later down the road when they see a ""non-passing"" trans person, they will see that person as a normal human being too.
For most forms of bigotry, it often comes down to a combination of never interacting with the hated group and socialization.

If you live in a small town or an insular community and you never interact with trans people, then it is very easy to not see them as a person. When that kind of person who you've never encountered is then talked about in a negative way by the other people in your community, it reinforces the idea that ""these people aren't like me and are bad.""

So people get into a habbit. They don't interact with these people but everyone they know says they're terrible for whatever reason (take your pick, transphobes have a lot of them). Now when that person finally meets a trans person, what do they have to go off of? An established hate and a pile of stereotypes about why they're bad people. So naturally they go about directing their hate at that person.

As with all other bigotry, the answer is exposure. The more time people have to spend around trans people, the more they'll realize they're just regular people. And once you can see someone as a regular person just like you, it's very hard to hate them.
I don’t feel like ignorance describes this anymore. People are just shallow.
Because people are taught to fear and hate us. It is insidious.
Seeing JK compare us to her abusive ex-husband just upsets me on a level that I can't even get mad anymore. I was yelling and calling her names when I first read it but now that it's been a few minutes... I'm just so tired of all of this.
people fear what they don’t understand
The same reason white supremacists hate black people, anti-semites hate Jewish people, homophobes hate gay people, etc.

It's a mix of cowardice, cruelty, and sadism. The comfort and satisfaction of keeping your boot on the neck of someone less powerful than you. Nothing more, nothing less. Anything else is a rationalization. Do not extend your empathy towards them. It's better placed somewhere else.
Because people suck. I know it can be difficult but try a different outlook. Instead of being sad try to look at how much those people will miss out on. How many great people they will never meet. Their lack of education doesn't make you any less valid. As long as in you're eyes you matter yiu always will. Remember that you don't loose anything by ignoring them.
Honestly I think a surprising number of them are deeply closeted themselves, either jealous they'll never have the courage to be themselves, or just massive self-loathing denial and overcompensation.
It threatens all the years of conditioning by giant movements, including monotheistic religions.  It's a lot to combat, but we do, one day at a time.
What you need to understand is that every generation has been plagued by those people who get offended at the notion of challenging the status quo or conventional wisdom. ""Earth was not the center of the universe"" was a fact too controversial for it's time and so it was widely rejected. ""Mankind evolved over the span of billions of years"" was a fact that not only was too controversial for it's time but is still attacked by older Republicans today.

And it only gets worse from there. ""Black people are equal to white people"" literally took us fighting a war before it was accepted, and even then, racism isn't dead. ""Gay people can be married"" was many decades of fighting and standing for equality before we saw progress which we're on the border of losing, thanks to Republicans. ""Trans people don't have to be their gender assigned at birth, and all scientific research does indeed confirm young children are quite good at recognizing their true gender, especially so as they get older and come to puberty"" isn't an idea that's going to just be accepted.

We will go through endless trials and tribulations, we will be attacked more than most, we will be insulted, ignored, and dehumanized by cruel, unreasonable, and indifferent people. We will endure this for decades before we see change. It will be slow, every victory will be small, and while justice may prevail in the end, it will take a very long time to get there.

The only hope is that the newer generations (millenials and gen z) are significantly better than boomers or gen x are. We are more aware of what's happening in the world around us.
Our breaking the strict rules of gender expression, makes them start questioning the nature of their own gender. And for some people that's way too much to contemplate. Lots of people are happy to blindly follow the rules, so us bucking that system pisses them off. A LOT.
People are terrible
Eventually we will have more laws protecting us.
There are so much more resources for us now
As well as the fact there are so many more starting to transition now 
We have higher chances that one of our sisters or brothers or non confirming folk in a spot or seat of power within political aspect
And with that we would have so much more help because we'd have someone pushing for our rights up top
It should already be happening but sadly we wait
It should be illegal to harass a trans person cyber or in person
Racism should be illegal
Sadly we have to deal with this for now
[removed]
Don't worry about JK Rowling she's just just another asshole with an opinion. I worry about the people in red states that can actually affect our lives.
So we're different and rare enough that people in power can fear monger over and demonize us in order to galvanize support for their own political and economic power and minimize their lack of interest in helpful change in communities while sweeping under the rug their own failings.

For instance, statistically speaking, you have higher chances of being molested in a bathroom by a republican representative than you do most folk, much less a trans person which statistically is lower even than your average. Try telling that to folks watching Fox News though.
>why do so many people hate us for seemingly no reason

It's not just you guys, humans are just creatures of hate. Look at, literally all of human history. It's nothing but racism, sexism, bigotry, violence against other cultures, people and species. It's in our nature, that doesn't mean every single person is naturally hateful. There are always exceptions, but many, probably even most people have at least one targeted group they hate. And it's even worse with masses of people, like yeah I know democrats and Republicans that don't outright hate the other parties. I know ones that do, there is diversity there. But when it comes to a mass of people, like the dem or repubs party, the entity does hate the other and it ""justifies"" hateful individuals inside of the group to hate the other.

Myself, I would consider aro/ace, but what I am in person is determined by who I'm around. If I'm around hateful bigots like at work, in straight. Friends know I don't give a shit about sex or relationships, they know the real me. But this whole situation of the hateful nature of man is the main reason I've just completely removed myself from, well everything. The human race, any culture or collective eventually boils down to hating something or somebody. It's disgusting, and I have yet to find any example (besides true Buddhists)who break this form. It is inescapable, we are all victims of it to some degree. Every group of people is hated by some other group, and unfortunately you guys are one of the most widely picked on groups in the world. Racism is case sensetive, a black person won't really experience it in Africa as an Asian doesn't get much h exposure to Asian hate in Japan. But sexuality and orientation or gender has a wider scope, it falls victim to this law of man's nature across all fronts, in any culture damn near. With small exceptions. The hate directed toward your people has a wider scope, many races and cultures hate gays or trans, and because that hate is so reinforced across the entire planet, it ""justifies"" being more outward, aggressive and violent toward your collective. In their mind at least, it doesn't actually justify anything but you know what they say. You can't reason with a sick mind. 

Anyways, I love y'all. Every trans person I've met and talked to are genuine great people, more and more people are catching into that. I know it doesn't look or feel like it but as a species we have made a lot of progress in these areas in the last 100 years. The sad reality is, it's going to take a LONG long long time to actually change on a large scale, probably outside all of our lifetimes. And even sadder than that, the hate isn't going away. It will just find another victim to be taken out on. This is the grotesque reality of our species, and it's why I decide to not participate in society or culture. Our species is not worth continuing, at all. And I really don't even want to be a part of it.
When a boomer says ""it's not natural"" become a heart surgeon, then you can say: 

""Sorry, pig valves don't naturally belong in a human aorta. We're gonna have to use recently FDA appproved plastics, please come back when you develop cancer, a murmur, or it decomposes/leaks.""
Cuz they're insane
Just like the core of all hate:
Cus we're different
They don’t understand and don’t know us so they hate us lol
You are a snowflake. (Not the insult kind) you are beautiful and different and unfortunately some people just cant handle that. Any animal including humans are afraid of things that change we like routine we like consistency And when they see something that doesn't fit in with their idea of routine and normal they savagely freak out. To put it nicely; evolution just has to hit them yet with the ability to not freak out about something different.
In the more concise, simple to digest way,

They just jealous of the swag
Because people are dumb, but for every few dumbasses there's that glimmer of hope in the way of someone who will treat you like the beautiful human being you are
Vegan & trans here, I have no idea how come I still have some friends
They hate us cuz they anus
It been embedded in society for the past 150 years and it's just now getting better (worse) and since homosexuality and POC are protected and it's just not ok with any sensible person to make fun of those communities so the (weak, limp dick) politicians and (mainly conservative) people who feel insecure have to take it out on transgender people.

In short its what different oppressed minorities had to go through so I wouldn't expect change even for gen-z. Hopefully in 50-60 years everyone can live in peace.
There will always be good people doing good things, and hateful people doing hateful things. But when it comes to good people doing hateful things... that takes politics or religion.
Because they’re idiots
Actually, no that’s offensive to idiots
Assholes?
No, that’s offensive to assholes
Yeah not sure
Trans freedom represents a legitimate threat to rape culture. 

That's it. That's the ballgame. Patriarchy and gendered power structures rely on immutable gender roles, which rely on immutable gender. The rich men in power don't want to give that up. They want to be able to control, silence, commodity and rape women with impunity. Gender identity self-identification threatens that. So they lie and threaten and troll to try to maintain the status quo.
I keep telling myself it’s illogical and yet I still feel subhuman nowadays
People saying it's not natural know nothing of nature. A lot of animals can change gender like chickens sharks and even clown fish. Just let trans people be themselves they are usually very friendly aswell wich makes it even more tragic.
Like really mate, I already hate myself and I don't need other people to do this.
Bruh... Whoever decided to say these stuff like: ""tHaT's NoT nAtURaL"" or ""yOu'Re NoT rEaL enough""... Can't y'all let the trans people live?! Daymn! If they wanted to make a transition or anything, let them do their things! Do you know this before saying that? No! Do you think is good to judge that person's choices or decisions? No! So why wouldn't they just delete their trash opinion and shut up! I can understand if my comment feels really harsh to read and I am very sorry, I just hate to see that community getting so much hate. If it's there any trans people in this subreddit or anywhere else, don't listen to those type of people, they're just jealous because you're beautiful and attractive, whoever you decided to be. Do yo thang and don't let anybody else judge you and remember that your family and friends would always look after you. Love y'all, peace
Because we seek a individual happiness that doesn't affect the lives of anyone around us.

They are just jealous. Jealous because the only way they can find happiness is by stepping on everyone they can see, so they can feed their superiority complex and justify their fake beliefs.

They hate to see people that different from them being happy. Different people should be miserable.

They feel like everyone must be like them and this creates the feeling that everyone is their property and they have the right to rule over whatever we do. We must do what they say is right. We must be like what they say is right. Otherwise, we should just be miserable.

Misoginy, homophobia, transphobia, racism... It's all the same shit. Stupid superiority complex of people with a very frail ego.

(Sorry for spelling mistakes, english not first language)
I don't know either :( i am a firm believer in people being taught to hate instead of developing a hatred of other people  so I guess I kinda pity that their life circumstances led them to this stage. 

Another theory I have is that we commonly despise people who get things without any effort. Perhaps they feel we are too entitled and get what ever we want which contradicts what they were taught to hate so they despise us. 

When we are just like them, people with difficulties trying to make it through life. We can see that, they can't. We are free, they are not.
Well, in Rowling's case it's partly because that person wanted to be a guy when younger (Rowling literally tweeted this, in the middle of the essay trying to discredit us) and never got the chance, and is full of sour grapes.

As for everyone else, well, for some it's the same, for others it's just seeing we won't conform to their worldview, which they've been taught to get angry instead of be confused by.
It's absolutely ridiculous. A similar sentiment seems to exist for gay people. It's so dumb to think unnatural equals bad. Cars, school, computers, and so many more things are all completely unnatural but there's not really carphobes or schoolphobes or computerphobes. Not to the extent that there are bigots like transphobes or homophobes.
Through fear of the “other” 

In order to “fit in” in society - people have had to lock all manor of different parts of themselves away. Quirks, eccentricities, emotions, behaviours, sexuality, gender expressions that go against “perceived/accepted norms” ... and the list goes on and on (sooo much of people’s psyches and experiences have been compartmentalised and locked away under the surface of their conscious awareness) so a lot of folks have parts of themselves that they keep suppressed away unconsciously. 

This hurts our psyches, it hurts our souls. 
Some people in this life begin doing the work of undoing that suppression and begin to unpack themselves and live with alignment to those parts that were deemed “unwanted” by society or were deemed “unacceptable” in order to acquiesce to the status quo. 

Those other folks who haven’t even begun to look at all the myriad ways we’ve been forced into that suppression by our culture/systems of oppression etc, see those who have begun to unpack their “societally undesirable” parts and expressing them openly, healing ourselves and others as we do so, and it ANGERS THEM. It ANGERS the parts they themselves have had to lock away or suppress
(PLEASE NOTE AS THIS PART IS IMPORTANT: I’m not saying all transphobes are trans or all homophobes are homosexual, but I am saying those people have very hurt unconscious parts of self that have been suppressed in order to fit in, for whatever reason) 
so they unconsciously project all their anger outwards towards us for daring to have the audacity to no longer limit ourselves or keep ourselves locked away. 

The people that carry on like this have deeply rooted unconscious and subconscious injuries that they’re not even slightly aware of. It’s really fucking sad, and they’re just really fucking afraid of the “others” in society because they have their own scared, traumatised, and now dangerous and dark parts because of how deeply down they’ve been buried, and how reviled they are by the conscious mind of the person, that were “othered” by society and then thusly by themselves in some way. 
They’re not even aware of how mad and hurt and angry and sad they are about it - so they just push it onto the people who chose to free parts of themselves. 

I know it hurts, but you’re living a truth for yourself that they’re too scared to even touch on a conscious level. (Again, not saying they’re trans, just saying they have deeply injured and unexplored parts of self that have been “othered” in some way growing up by society and then continued to be suppressed and “othered” by themselves, within themselves)

They’re all just spewing out their unconscious injuries and hurt. No excuses whatsoever because what they do is dangerous, dehumanising and completely unhealthy/dysfunctional as a response, and it only serves to further suppress and harm others and continue these cycles, but this is what it is.
You need a hug. A nice, warm, fuzzy, and comforting hug.
It opens up their mind to the fact that things can be different which scares them, they'd rather stick their head in the sand then do something like question their gender or sexuality so they make up these statements to comfort their bigotry
In my opinion I think this has to do with change, we see in history that people don't like when things change but it eventually becomes acceptable to them. Take 100 years ago when a lot more people were racist but today it is frowned upon. I do believe that things will get better.
If it makes you feel a lil better OP, I love you very much!

And it so happens I am a people! C:
I don't think transphobes realize that transitioning is the only treatment for gender dysphoria. If you told a suicidal person that they're insane + delusional for wanting to kill themself and withhold treatment from them people would know that isn't right to do, so idk why it's considered ok to do to trans ppl
I dont know if this is a common case or not, but for a long time I was transphobic. I'm not sure if what I'm about to say is the actual reason behind it, but most of my family was openly transphobic, and since I had never met anyone who was trans, I had no reason to not believe what my family was saying. I was like that for 5 years or so, but when my partner came out to me as non binary, I realized that there was nothing wrong with being trans. I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you never see anything that contradicts what you hear, you have no reason to not believe what you hear. I guess, at least for some people, they're just uneducated about the topic, and that's what causes the transphobia.
most transphobes have never met a single trans person. they fear the unknown, and dehumanize is, just like racists and antisemites and misogynists. 


arguing with them is a waste of time. showing them our simple humanity and reminding them we are just like them, is the way forward. I am not some pervert, or mental patient - I am a girl who watches Netflix and wants a dog and goes to concerts. just like anybody else. it's hard to hate that.
They hate what they can't control
Because people are insecure and don’t want to admit it and instead blame minorities
Hate is a learned behavior , kids don't hate they learn to hate when their younger.  Some one they trusted at some point told them it was wrong and that plantes the seed that grew in to hate.  And I know the jk Rawling one hurt me as well because I always saw Harry Potter as this world were you could be trans, part of me just assumed Hogwarts had a trans student they just never mentioned it in the story because why would they need to.   I cried a long time when I found out the truth.
I did something similar, mainly getting into Twitter arguments with exclusionaries on Greta's post about women's day. A lot of them got angry when Greta wrote ""gender"" and not ""sex"". So many were intentionally excluding the T from LGBT and it really triggered me. And yeah, always defaulting to ""Well you can't ever change your sex.""

And their attacks were mentally draining and just put me in a bad mental space all day today. I need to cool it on Twitter debates... that shit gets to me sometimes ugh.

I feel like sex and gender roles and gender identity are still not well defined in the cis world and so many just see gender role and gender identity (and gender expression) as the same thing.
Yep. Hatred formed from prejudice, formed from ignorance, formed from privilege. It’s a fucking painful experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone, but apparently we’re “transing the kids” and whatnot.
Sorry for the top post hijack, but I think there's more to it than that.

Politicians, churches, influencers, ... are actively using that prejudice to gain favour with their supporters. Show them their enemy, teach them to hate their enemy, show them how you're hurting their enemy. It's a tried and true political strategy.

Sure, prejudice is never going to be gone completely, there will always be a few shitty people. But we aren't dealing with a handful of isolated shitty people, we're dealing with actual organized bigotry. That's not something that just happens on its own.

Being trans isn't just considered a stigma, it's considered a political issue. That's a very clear hint that more than just regular old prejudice is going on. Society is also prejudiced against many other things (like say being overweight) without them becoming entangled with politics.

Why is the trans community suffering so much abuse? Because people with reach are fanning the flames and profiting off it.
How do you explain closeted trans people who are transphobic then?
prejudices don't always go away that easily. Transphobes who later come out as trans can still punch down/within the community. Trutrans/transmeds come to mind.
Making people confront the idea of humanity, what makes us, our body, our mental mind, our physical mind, our sense of self and if it exists our soul even is very difficult, a topic that I would love to debate about for hours if I could.
Definitely this. It makes me feel so pessimistic though. I don't know how we could possibly have a better future. It's so easy for demagogues to manipulate people with hate. And when things inevitably start falling apart, there will be more persecution and genocide.
So you had internalized transphobia too?
I hear you, and it’s definitely possible that JK could be closeted LGBTQ+… but I also just want to point out that there is a very big difference between “wishing you were a man” because you despise the inconveniences and/or pain of living in such a misogynistic society, and genuinely WISHING YOU WERE A MAN. Personally, I find it hard to believe that someone (even if they have a whole lot of self-loathing) would do so much to actively harm the community they’re a part of.
I wouldn't say that's the case for JK Rowling. Some people just don't want trans people to exist and she's one of them.
I don't love this argument though because some people really are just awful
I had to get through my own confirmation bias on this. Just because I took time to come out doesn’t mean everyone projecting toxic paradigms does it because they feel out of whack in their gender in a trans way. Some gender journeys are insecurity in assumed gender. 
I agree, either way they’re projecting toxicity where logic and reason have answers they don’t like, so that correlates, but it’s not always a trans struggle. Not always causation.
the way jk rowling’s writer alias is ROBERT hmmmmmmmmm
no, most people who hate us are just ignorant assholes. and that's it, there is nothing more to that. 

also, I hate how this rethoric heavily implies that it's members of the lgbt community are the ones responsible for lgbt-phobia. like it's our fault people hate us and we're just making ourselves look like victims, and in reality it's us who are making up all the homophobia and transphobia to play victims.

obviously it's not like that, but many people believe that to be true.
Yeah, I live in a backwater town in Alberta, and I cannot safely be trans in public, or I could be hate crimed or murdered. A few public trans adults in cities get garbage thrown at them when they walk home, and it's awful. I can't wait get out of here.
I'm in the infamous ""liberal"" Midwest city and boy howdy is it hell for us here
Not really, just the same old bs. I just saw her mentioned recently because I saw a post about her getting into a twitter argument with vaush and I wanted to see if it was real.
This, all of this! They know capitalism can't survive us, and it is already self-cannibalizing. They're coming after us to try and maintain their wealth, privilege, and power, vested in them by capitalism, and, therefore, capitalism itself. The question is whether capitalism will die before they exterminate us, or after capitalism leads to the final extinction of humanity itself.
Im mtf, I can fix a circuit board, rebuild an engine, took martial arts and I can roof the top shelf on skates. I can out man most men and I can do it in heels.
Shaun’s video I assume?
Scripture doesn’t mention transgender and verses that can be interpreted by manipulating them I can easily refute. I read the thing 5 times while these bigots barely read 50 pages of it.
>It also says woman shouldn't wear mens clothing but we don't talk about that...
best fantasy book
Oh so that obviously means you should kill people and brutally harass them right? Because it makes you a little uncomfortable hearing about queer existence?
Yeah, it's almost like trans people are struggling a lot with their identity and so it takes up a large portion of their lives.
There's two types of Vegans. The ones who are just that and go about their lives and the ones that try to shove their beliefs down others throats like That Vegan Teacher.

The ones that try to shove their beliefs down others throats are the ones that make the community look bad and hence the hatred of those that call themselves vegans.

Same with the Trans Community. You can be Trans without trying to force people to convert to your beliefs and most of those that do just live their lives in peace and go about their day to day. But those who are the most vocal and think that everyone should make new rules that only apply to them ruin it for the rest of us.

Even in the feminist movement. You can be a feminist without automatically thinking that all guys are misogynistic pigs or you can be the others that automatically think that all guys should be treated like shit just because they're a guy.

Not everyone is a certain way just because others like them are a certain way. But the most vocal of us are usually the ones that ruin it for everybody else.
The ignorance of some of those people truly beggars belief. Some of them think that we want to transition because it’s fun when it’s not. It’s the only way to save ourself from having to live a life of misery and it annoys me endlessly because they really do think that we can just go back to living as the gender assigned at birth with no problems.
I told my wife that if I could take a pill to remove my GID I wouldn't.  After finally accepting myself and learning to love myself I just couldn't ever be a CIS man. I'm a woman and that's what I will always be.  Denial me was just a huge jerk who just over compensated to hide her real self out of fear. The fear is gone. She agreed that she wouldn't want me any other way after all these years. I'm so lucky to have her.
It all started with misoginy, then we never let go of the primitive racism. What's next? Toxic capitalism feeding those things as a means to make money and gain power. Skip a few centuries and we have a ""Frankenstein"" (I know he's not the monster) of prejudices that we never adressed before and it's all up to our generation to deal with all that shit.
Your right in prejudice being political... It always has been. 

Sugar manufacturers lobbying against restrictions to reduce obesity is an obvious one. Before that it was tobacco manufacturers that smoking doesn't harm people. And many politicians make their Mark by peddling prejudice in its many forms but then so do the Mega churches in the US. Prejudice is everywhere and everyone. We each have it in ourselves if we care to lift our face mask for a moment (because a moment is all we can bear). So we use all sorts of Adaptive Inattention (denial) to cover up our own prejudices to our selves.

For the record, the US second amendment on guns is another prejudice... The prejudice that it's their right to bear arms.

Birth control and pregnancy is another...

As is the right to determine your own gender...

Bottom line... Prejudice... It's always somebody else's fault.

Self-hatred is a hell of a drug
Internalized transphobia which they take out on others. And if they're openly trans and transphobic, then they're just awful people in general.
Either it's internalized transphobia or they don't want to be scoped out as trans as how some queer people used to be homophobic
It's pretty obvious to me.  They deny in others the same thing they deny in themselves. -M
Yeah, but I think that at least some would understand where we're coming from. That's all I really want, is for them to understand the hardships and pain we deal with on the daily. If they're still assholes about it, then they were never redeemable. But I think people really need to have more empathy, and just notice that *we're human too.*
Humanity doesn't deserve to survive imo.
Yeah, it was awful. I was a total asshole. And I'm deeply sorry for everything I did
It's probably more common that one would think.

I knew a guy who, before he came out as gay, admitted that he, too, was a raging homophobe. Did all the things, said all the words.

then, he kissed another guy and bamf! no more homophobe, just an extremely shy and somewhat damaged gay dude
>I hear you, and it’s definitely possible that JK could be closeted LGBTQ+

She *might* be. Draw your own [conclusion...](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/06/10/jk-rowling-trans-terf-essay-transphobia-gender-identity-dysphoria-mental-health-harry-potter/)
Used to live in MN, am in NY now and I really just think it's hell all over. America is better than a lot of the socialist ""utopia's"" out there, places like Finland, Sweden, and Norway, ECT, but the bars so damn low. 

Like, I've never had to worry about my physical safety outside of Europe but it's just mentally exhausting, stresses your mental sanity to the point I'm not surprised that other trans people are seen as unhinged. Honestly, it's no wonder our rates of mental illness are so high.

All that ramblings to say, it's just sad that even in the blue states that supposedly ""support"" us, we're treated like pedophile degenerates.
Chicago or Minneapolis?
i’ve been trying to focus purely on the fact that her arguing with Vaush is actually kind of hilarious to me
And personally, I'm a big fan of survival and humanity's potential, so I'm in the ""save ourselves through socialism"" camp.
Yeah. Fantastic video.
what else could it mean then? i’ve read the whole Bible multiple times, before i gave up hating myself for it’s teachings.
[removed]
Yep, they seem to think we can just be converted to cis, and live happily. They tried it with gay people, it didn’t work. They tried it with us too, it hasn’t worked. If we had a choice in the matter, we wouldn’t BE transitioning. We wouldn’t even BE trans. These people are ridiculous.
I do agree. People are unnecessarily cruel. It would be lovely to have the magic ""i was always a girl"" button. I would push it in a heartbeat. That having been said.... i would be lying if i said i wasn't absolutely having a blast with my transition. Finding my style, my voice, my inner lil girl, these have been wonderful experiences for me, even if not everyone else has had much good to say about it. No one gets to dim my shine for more than a moment. I have chosen to have fun with this, and make it about me, and the hell with anyone else who doesn't like it. I cannot hear their criticisms over my own laughter and squees of delight.
*Mike Pence has entered the chat*
*vomits* Blaire White
*points at truscum*
I never was shy. Before transition I embraced the role and after embraced the role. I was worried if I came off as shy or isolated it would mean something was wrong. I really over compensated.
Damn, that's really interesting. Now I suppose *I* wonder if she would have transitioned, too. But that's the point, she would have had the opportunity to really consider that choice as an actual option. She seems be suggesting, maybe she would have *and if she did that would have been the wrong choice.* 

Well I dunno, maybe the whole second wave feminist reinterpretation of gender she underwent instead was a suboptimal choice, but it was the best she could do at the time. Things have a way of getting more real when they're actually there in front of you, and I think actually having a testosterone shot on the table would have pretty clearly clarified the difference between ""life would be easier if I was a boy"" and ""I should have been born a boy."" It's also not as if therapists just say ""you seen unhappy with your gender, here, have some hormones."" They would be *asking* those questions like ""what if your father supported you unconditionally? what if people didn't expect frilly pink from you?"" Etc.
I’m in Minneapolis. It ain’t too bad
When scripture says one can not cut off their member before entering the assembly that refers to eunuchs and the assembly was a physical place of worship in Israel. Jesus broke that as evidence by the Eunuch being baptized. The verse speaking about man shall not wear that of a woman and woman shall not that of a man is speaking not about clothing directly. It speaks under circumstances of which regarding context. In that time Israel was deep into pagan worship. Some men dressed as female idols and women dressed as soldiers. Those who apply it to today are very ignorant of scripture and the history and context of scripture.
Why are you going out of your way to be in a trans space then?
The only reason I'd rather be the same as I am instead of born cisgender is because of the life I have now. Sure, the dysphoria and dysmorphia suck and are very confusing, but I have many relationships that I value now, and I know some people are still around because of me. But if there were a button to switch agab, I would press it immediately
Please elaborate further! What do I not know?
*vomits too* Kalvin Garrah
This whole “life would be easier” vs “this is who I AM” dichotomy is so important. And, ultimately (I think) the fundamental difference between being a person who is frustrated by patriarchal society, and being a transgender human or trans man.
didn’t they get very rebuked from anything pagan related like that? like it was a big deal and god was mad so he forbid that just like it says in the verse?

i would say it means as it reads, and every christian person i grew up with interpreted it by the way it directly reads. it feels like a lot of creative explaining that someone had to look very hard for, when it actually just means men wear man clothes and women wear womens clothes.

so if i went back in time and wore womens clothing back then you’re telling me they would have been ok with it? if i wore a dress, shaved, and said i was a woman they wouldn’t have hurt me?

honestly not trying to be mean when i say this but also i feel like i’m having a difficult time reading most of the sentences you typed, i don’t feel like that answered anything…

“it speaks under circumstances of which regarding context” is a hard sentence to follow 

even if you’re right about it entirely, the average person interprets it the way i do and that’s a problem for transgender people
That’s the problem when you read scripture such as the Bible one has to deep dive into each verse. He forbade it regarding the context behind it. The Levites would understand it but not another tribe. They may have questioned you but they wouldn’t have hurt you.
again not to be mean but i simply don’t believe you… there’s literally no other context and it says ANYONE who does this is an abomination. 

and again if it requires so much education and context, if you are entirely correct, maybe the average person just shouldn’t even read it"	tb6mzv	trans	1157	0.98	2022-03-10 19:26:23

Why people are asking their name from others? It's your name, you should choose a name that describes you. The point is being yourself, not asking from others who you are.

I'm bad with names but I'll try my best.  Uhhhhhhh ham sandwich
willow!
There are three names that I like, two of which I would have given to daughters had I been able to give them birth.  My two daughter’s names would have been “Phoebe” and “Leah” (pronounced “Lay-uh,” not just “Lee”).  The other name is one with which I identify in it’s history, “Cassandra.”  I find identification because Cassandra in Greek mythology was given the gift of extremely accurate prophecy, but the curse of having no one believe her—something of my common personal experience.
You look like a clove to me
Lisa
Ashley or Aynsley
First instinct says cassie
Isabella or Anna
Melanie for sure
Beautiful 😍

Mikaela!
Esther
Renée pronounced Ra-nay means born again. It's the name that popped into my ears when I saw you.
Ashly, or ash
Lauren or Allie
You are a Nicole or Nikki in my opinion
Oliver-michelle has a nice ring to it

THANK YOUUUUUU 🥺🥺🥺
Ehhh
It's between Oliver and Marceline, and yeah, I know Oliver is a boy's name, but it oddly fits me
Ehhh..A lot of people like my idea for Marceline
I was thinking Oliver or Marceline..Which one suits a British girl more? Since I have a British accent
Eh..I was thinking Oliver or Marceline
That one doesn't click with me
Zulie..That makes me think of a dog I had a long time ago named Zyla
That one doesn't click too well

That's the name of a girl I work with 😭
Not bad at all :) 
First it was the A names, now everyone's gravitating to L names
That's not bad at all, but a little on the basic side for my liking
I'm considering Oliver and Marceline
Ooh, okie!
Ooh, fancy
Hmmm..Not clicking
""I'm sworn to carry your burdens..""
Ehhh, not clicking
Well, that's uh. The name of my ex. So, probably a no for me, even though it makes sense, because I make music
Hmm..Ehh, not my type of name
THANK YOU <3
Who?
I'm not sure
No, I don't like it
Hmmm..
Ehh, not a fan
Too old fashioned
I was thinking Oliver or Marceline
I was thinking Oliver or Marceline
I was thinking Oliver or Marceline
I'm thinking Oliver or Marceline
I was thinking Oliver or Marceline..which one do you think fits me?
I don't know which one that is
I was thinking Oliver or Marceline
What about Oliver? Or Marceline?
Ehh..I was thinking Oliver or Marceline
Mhm
Hm...Eh, doesn't fit me
Ehh. I like Oliver and Marceline
Rhea is cute, but I don't think it fits me
Thank you 🥺
What?
Ehh..No, not really
Not my type
I don't think it fits me
I was preferring Oliver or Marceline
That is way off how I look
Cute, but I don't think it fits me
Eh
I don't like that one
Ehh, no
Not really
Tg?
I was thinking of Oliver. But also Marceline
Quite a few people have said that
I do?
Ehh, not my type
No, doesn't fit me >.>
Jayden is the name of my baby brother, that'd be awkward ^^'
The name came to mind first, I genuinely think you look like an Eileen, and then the joke popped in my head seconds later. Lol
Cute asf, but I don't think it fits me
Thank youuuu 🥺
I still worry if I pass, sometimes..Even though I've been on hrt for 7 months
Thank you :)
But I've already decided on either Oliver or Marceline
I've already decided on either Oliver or Marceline
That's dangerously close to the last name I tried using, Kora
Ehhh
Enby?
I don't think it fits me that well
I've decided on either Oliver or Marceline
Thank you :)
Fnaf moment
Cute, but I don't think it fits me
Thank you <3
Really?
I've already decided between two names :3
Ooh..I like Eve. But Iris is a flower..What about Iris?
Yes, my name used to be Luuma
Gretta is waaayy too old fashioned
Cute, but I'm not sure if I like it
Thank youuu <3
They're just suggestions. I'm not letting people choose my name
The pfp? I can see where you're coming from
Thank you ^~^
Thank you :)
Thank youuuu <3
I do be a snack, tho
Cute :3
Very in depth..But, I've already decided it's either gonna be Oliver or Marceline
I've decided on either Oliver or Marceline
I feel like that's ba reference to something that I don't get
Ehh..No..What about Oliver or Marceline?
🤨
And that name sucks ass! :D
ಠ_ಠ
No
Don't act like we all aren't mentally ill in some way. The human race is fucked
Uh, I'm male to female, not female to male
Like what, I meant it as a compliment not a snide remark.
Alicia in wonderland?
I wanna be leader
Yeah- youre really pretty- sorry i cant thi k of a name though 😅
Would you mind if i dm'd you? I have a couple of things that i think you could teach me about-
Glad you like it!
Angela, or Jessica.
OwO
hehe that warms my soul 🤍🤍 i hope you keep discovering yourself and all the cool things about you
fair enough, marceline or oliver fits better, sandra is kind of an old lady's name😭
I support
I think sometimes there's just like an inherent association with a particular letter in people. I don't know what causes it but I strangely see it a lot. It was the same for me, most of the names that made it to the top of my list and that people thought fit best were all J names
Np! happy day of visibility. <3
it's a girl's name if it's your name and you're a girl!
Oooooh. That fits nicely! 😊
Olive or Olivia
Your eyes just scream Mary to me, but maybe it's too plain for your personality ÷^
Not sure how I should feel about that... But I am a furry so what the heck, thanks!! XD
WAIT, WHY DO I LOOK LIKE ANA FROM FROZEN
I hope you find the name you're looking for :-)
ABSOLUTELY STEAL
You are very gorgeous as well oml <3
aww alright, well i hope you find a name that you feel fits you and you're comfortable using. good luck! <3
That’s fine, it’s always your choice
i'd call you ads or ki as a nickname (:
Lily/Lillian 
Violet
Amber 
No matter what you choose in the end, it’ll be perfect for you cause it was chosen by you.
Adina ?
Oof, my bad
Alissa, Hope, Gladys, etc.

Anika is another one I thougt of
Ooh I like those too


I am adding them to the list
MARCELINE THE VAMPIRE QUEEN

Oliver, or Olivia? Either would be good
Marceline is unique and sweet.
I think you would be cute as heck being Oliver, but I Doo love marceline too
You've never seen The Real Ghostbusters? 

&#x200B;

https://ghostbusters.fandom.com/wiki/Egon\_Spengler/Animated
Marceline is great too
:(
Yeah, I think they suits you 😊
Yeah I get it. It's odd even though I picked my name I've been tempted to see what people would say my name is and if anyone or a majority picked the name I chose myself
that’s fair it was just the first thing that came to mind :)
I mean respectfully, you asked us. So to me, you look like a Siobahn. If you don't like it, don't use it.
I understand I hope you find your name I know what it is like I'm trying to figure out my name too. I am down to 2 names
Yeah, It's a nice name
100000000%
I did a double take.
Glasses, hair colour and all.
cute !! both of those suit you very nicely as well :)
Love both of those! Beautiful names for a beautiful girl!
waaa you dont like ????
Enby = Non-binary
Totally fair, good luck with your name search though I bet you'll find a fantastic one!
Ah, okay. Sorry I’m late. Both names sound lovely!
Idk the ref sorry lol you just look like a Vanessa
perfectly good! a choice that *you* feel fits you is one better than what anyone else thinks, says, or wants!
Yeah! If you want to really test it out, I suggest having a friend or someone call you by a name that you’re considering for at least a day. I think that you will know which one suits you best when you hear it! 😊
Oh. Well may I ask which ones? :3
iris is so good and so fitting!
oh well Im sorry
yeah yeah i get what you mean :)
She does vlogs too I know if it isn’t on her main channel wildspartanz might have video of her lol
True true, you make a good point
Both wonderful choices.
Great now I I've got the theme song to cheers stuck in my head, and I kinda wanna cry. 

Go with Marceline. That's my new vote
Nah it’s just a really funny name I thought of, but in actuality a good name might be something like Abby?  Chantelle?  Senor taco?  Bridget?
[removed]
Yes, I know, I love Alice In Wonderland
It was just very unexpected
Too exotic for my tastes
Hehehe, it's okay :) I appreciate the compliment
It makes me think of My Talking Angela
I'm too much of a shitposter to not think of any memes to do with a name, and it makes it complicated
Owo
I will :) thank you for the suggestions!
Mhmm
Yes :)
I like how Oliver fits me, though. I'm leaning heavily towards Oliver
Thank you, you too 💕💕💕
Yes :)
No, Oliver
I mean, I see it, but like, it doesn't click with my personality
HEWWO FEWWOW FUWWY UWU /s/s/s
Thank you :) I've been really liking Oliver, though
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, BUT I'M ON BOARD
THANK YOUUUU
I like Marceline, but my mom said it doesn't fit me..
Mhm. I mean, it's cute, and it fits me, but I have some very bad experiences with someone with that name, so it brings back those memories
Hehehehe
Aaweee..thank you..
Too close to my dead name
It'd alright :)
Eh :(
Oh dear..I LOOK SO MUCH LIKE HER
I've never heard that name. It sounds nice, but it doesn't fit me
Yays :)
Oliver, not olivia, but YES, THE QUEEN, and while I do love her, it's not the reason I chose the name
:)
Which one fits a British voice more? Since I have a British accent
No, I haven't
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SniosijA2uI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SniosijA2uI)  
 If you have the time...

keep i mind this cartoon is from the 80s...
YAYS :D
I sorry :(
Which one suits me better?
Mhm
I'm not being rude. Sorry. I was just very confused. I've never heard that name before. What culture does it originate from?
Which one suits me better?
Yus ^-^
It doesn't fit me :(
Ooh, okay. Sweet
Which one suits me better?
Oop, alright. Sorry
It's between Oliver or Marceline
You think so?
No need to be, it's okay :)
Okie
What's Cheers?
I already chose Marceline :)
Oh, right. Just saw the name
Surprises are nice when there nice.
My real fem name is Polly ,do you like that name.
Welp, that is a sign for you then!
There's nothing wrong in exocitism.
Well I think your beautiful
OLIVIA__NUMA__LANGUID__
REW__VERT__ZAR
You kinda look like a Laura to me :3
I second the compliment. Also, lookin like a Grace to me
ahahahahaha mmm maybe Elisabeth? that's  my girl name if you like it feel free to use it \^\^
The only other name that comes to mind is when I'm looking at your cute smile, I makes me think Isabell
THE NAME
well you don't have to listen to your mom. your new name is your choice, and it can be whatever you want it to be. if you feel comfortable with and like Marceline, you should use it. :}
Just imagine that person being tortured by Satan himself and when you die you can torture them yourself
Alethea
I was listing names I thought would fit you!

I think Kieran would suit you. I am certain that the name Kieran is gender neutral.

But if you're looking for a feminine name, I think you could go with Christine.
The resemblance is uncanny
alright, well, good luck finding a name, I'm sure something will stick eventually :D
I think Oliver fits really well. I know a British Oliver too and they are lovely
Its okay, hope you find a nice name
I'd say Marceline
my partner , roommate , and i all thought that marceline was lovely :)
i think mo does :)) but just do what your comfy w/
Hmmm…. When I think Marceline, I picture someone with darker hair. You know why. Maybe Oliver? I dunno, whichever feels more right to you, I guess.
It’s okay lol
Ooooooh! Lovely!
:)

An old tv show about a bar and it's patrons dealing with life. 🎶Where everybody knows your name!

But that part is technically irrelevant. It was used in an episode of adventure time. The crazy [ice king](https://www.google.com/search?q=ice+king&oq=ice+king&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l7.1828j0j4&client=ms-android-verizon&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8) wasn't always the crazy ice king. 

In fact he was an archeologist of sound mind. On a dig, he found a crown that bestowed magical ice powers that slowly ate away at his mind. It was also the reason he survived a nuclear apocalypse along side a child vampire named Marceline. He took care of her as they were the last two people on earth. He still kept the crown on hand as a weapon of last resort but so long as he didn't wear it he maintained his sanity.
Watch this one first

Then watch this one

Nice, good shit!  It’s difficult to find a name I’m ngl so good for you!
[removed]
Yes! It's my great grandma's name, and I think it's cute :)
I don't feel like I look like an Alice, though. I was thinking Marceline or Oliver
Yes, but I don't look like an exotic person, I just look like a basic white British e-girl. So, I think Oliver or Marceline would fit me
I know, I do too :)
As cute as that name is, it isn't clicking with me
It doesn't really click with me that much.. I've been thinking of Oliver, though. Even though it's mainly a boy's name, it sounds wonderful as a girl's name
Yes, my boyfriend also suggested that, ar some point
ALRIGHT, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. WHY ARE WE SHOUTING?
Yes, I like that. Cause she's a pedophile and she groomed me :)
Too exotic >~>
Christine is close to my mom's name, so noooo..but, I like Marceline or Oliver
I KNOW
I was thinking Oliver or Marceline
Ooh, okie!
I'm trying to decide between Oliver and Marceline
Ooh..Okies
YAYS
I mean, I do have pretty dark hair, my hair is just dyed
Which one do you think fits me better?
Have a good night <3
Good bot :)
Ah, yes, Adventure Time, one of my most favourite shows of all time. I know Ice King's back story fairly well, but I didn't choose Marceline because of the Vampire Queen
I know the storrryyyyyyt, I've watched Adventure Timeeee, it's AMAZING
Thank you <3
Your Grandma's most likely a feminine and elegant lady with that name bestowed upon her
I think you look like whichever you want the most, but Marceline and Oliver are cute too! Marceline would be nice if you like the nickname Marci too.
I thought you were in usa, hey I live in England too
You don't look basic beauty is in the eye of the beholder
i love marceline for u!
Lol the inspiration for Alice in wonderland was a basic white girl named Alice
See ya later gorgeous
Fair
Thats a really good name sounds really cute
It's a name that simply suits your smile and it means summer and beautiful in a handful of languages
IM EXCITABLE SORRY
Well damn, Satan will bring in the higher up demons to also torture them while he tortures them
Lily
You're going with masculine?
Oh, those names sound pretty ✨
Marceline looks pretty nice, in my opinion
And the appearance of a fictional character isn’t a great basis for the decision anyways, I admit. Well, Marceline IS more feminine, I think, and has a fancy sound to it.
I'd say Marcelline it's just so good with the hair and glasses just mwah.
Well it certainly influenced me😁
Sorry I already hit post before your comment came through.
[removed]
Yes, she is. She's also one hell of a cook, like most grandma's. Now I want her gravy and biscuits
Mhmmm.. I can't decide between the two :(
Same name as Marci  bowers I wouldn't mind that if I wasn't called Polly.
Well, I am, but I have a British accent
Ehhhh..
I am not surprised
Mhm :(
THANK YOUUUU
Hehehe :) I prefer Winter, though
I AM AS WELL
Yesssss
I've had several people say Liky
Masculine?..
Do they fit me? Which one fits me better?
Do they fit me? Which one fits me better?
I didn't do it because Marceline from Adventure Time ;-;
I just thought it sounded nice, and it fits my personality..
Hehehe, thank you for your input ^~^
Fair enoughhhh
I don't use that name anymore, but I don't know what to be callledddd
Have you decided a fem name for yourself.
If you need a vote I like Marceline, but maybe try both? Try out one for a little bit of time and see how it feels then the other. You don't have to choose it and commit 100% no-takesy backsy.
Oh ,that sounds unusual if you know what mean
And from what I see your beautiful
Would you mind if i dm'd you?
I may even help torture them, I know some uh.. interesting ways of torture
Luz
Lily*
Sorry, I came up with feminine names because you looked rather feminine. I thought you were going for masculine when you said you liked Oliver...
I like the name Marceline, but whatever you prefer is nice
It certainly DOES sound nice. I’m sorry, I was really only prepared to give a suggestion. Marceline is a great name, and if you wanna go with it, you’d rock it.
Always!
Lol it's like we're playing tag.
[removed]
No, not yet.. I've already gone through Luuma and Kora, but neither of which gave me that ""yes, this is me"" feeling. But Oliver does. Even though it's primarily a boy's name, it sounds good as a girl's name as well. Especially with me
Yeah, I'm trying out Oliver for a bit..I like it a lot. I'm gonna see what being called Marceline is like, and see if it feels better
Yeah. I didn't have this accent before, but once I started seriously vocal training about a year ago, I started developing the accent, and now I can't speak without the accent if I wanna sound feminine. So, yeah
I know I am, but I am basic
Of course not, go ahead!
EPIB, I DO TOO
Bleh
No, no. I just like how well Oliver fits me, despite being a boy's name. I mean, I'm a British girl who acts boy-ish, so like, it makes sense
Okie!
Thank you :)
Have a good day <3
I got confused for a second
[removed]
I got mine from a pantyhose advert back in 80s called  Pretty Polly Stockings.
If not Olivia, what about just… Olive? I think it’s cute!

Olivair? Olivuh? Olivah? 

I do like that whole “family” of names tho. Lol
You could change letters slightly to Olivah
Why not Olivia then?
Want a dm
Maybe try olive?
you could always go by liv too🥰 my cousin does that he's trans ftm and used to be called olivia but now his name is oliver and he still goes by liv!
I love Olive for you! I have a friend who’s named Olive!
I wish you luck, both are great so no matter what you can't go wrong c:
We have this saying in England ,a beautiful girl is turning into an English Rose and you are blossoming into one.
There nothing wrong with basic.
I love this interaction. I hope you two click! You are super pretty!
We will have fun torturing them
Lizbeth
*elizabeth
If that's how you feel, I strongly suggest gender neutral names...
Thank you u too ✨
Sorry I get a little over hyped about stuff and my brain goes a million miles an hour. I try to keep in check but it slips out every once in a while. 


Also I apparently missed all the parts with Marceline's mom. Just watched that and now I want to go and watch the whole series again.
Gemma..Huh. Never heard that one before
Name ideas come from the weirdest places, sometimes
Hmm..Well, then people would misread it as ""Olivia"", and I don't like that name
Because I don't like that name. I prefer Oliver
I like Oliver, though
Okie, thank you <3
🥺💕
Exactly, that's what I was saying
>:)
Ehhh
I will :)
I wanna watch Adventure Time with someone :(
I'm gonna ask my bf
[removed]
It wasn't weird trying them on the denier is so smooth like silk on fresh shaven legs
Your cute whatever name you decide
Sounds like you've got it then :)
Hm yea i get it, if you like it, you should do that! I like the name jamie, even though it's often used by girls
See you later Oliver
Time for torture methods used for witch trials
Why its so hard to choose a name for a pretty lady :(
Very nice.
Well, I do have a British accent
I've tried pantyhose before. So comfy ☺️
AAWEE, THANK YOU <3
Mhm!
BURN THE WITCH
I don't know :(
Yes, it is going to be very nice
[removed]
I'm in heaven when I try them on
Do you want to dm
Paralyze them with katanas in their body while they are immortal but thrown in a bottomless sea in constant pain
You deserve the most beautiful of the names
Yes
I have some black ones lying around somewhere. I should dig them up
Sure!
Bruh, that's some Cartel shit
YES
I was thinking about Marceline
[removed]
Yes, or use what I call the finger crusher 9000
Sounds good and unique
I'm thinking Oliver or Marceline
Tell me more
Do you think it fits me?
[removed]
marceline suits you, and Marcie could be a nickname if you wanted!
Back in the early witch trials someone used something to crush a “witch’s” fingers to get them to admit to being a witch
Its not a bad option , what about Alice ?
YAYS
Mhm!!
I don't know
I don't want to be captain obvious but it should be something really meaningfull to you , i Mean i see like that
I know. But Marceline is meaningful to me
Choose that then , just for curiositie why is this name meaning full to you
Well, it's the name of one of my favourite cartoon characters, but that's not the reason I picked it. I just thought it sounded nice
Oooh i see ! I like that :)

My 2021 resolution is to stop letting my height bother me and just own it. Happy New Years everyone!		"Being tall and broad shouldered was all fun and games for me until I discovered I was trans.

You look stunning, darling, don’t let the height and shoulders stop you from being the fucking goddess I know you are.

Stay classy, sister. Know you are loved.
Damn right sister, stand tall walking into the next year.
Personally, I like tall girls. 😘 Own your model-like height.
Amazons' unite!
Okay but tall girls have me like 👀 it's nothing to be ashamed of, it is something to be celebrated
Own it girl!
Damn!!! Owning it hun! Stand tall!!
something something ZZ Top
You look amazing, don’t doubt yourself!
The thought that made me change my view on being tall (6'4 here) was that I refuse to apologize for the space I take up in this world for existing.
[deleted]
What books are on your coffee table ?
Tall girls are litteritly the fucking rarest and best thing ever holy shit <3
Yes girl! 👏 I’m 6’6 in heels and it finally feels normal to me, you look stunning just slay, gorgeous!
Get it however you want it and find pride in your flaws! So proud of you!* Note edited
you go girl!!!!
Nothing like a tall beauty to stop and make you look. You’re beautiful 💋
Models are 5’11. Clothes just look better on taller bodies 🥰
You just do you and let the people look. They are just jealous of how beautiful you are.  
I love the outfit btw.
Tall girls are 😳
You look absolutely fabulous gurl x
Tall is good
You're so fucking gorgeous I love long legs.
Broad shoulders equals bigger hugs
Gurl thats hot
Don't let it bother you I myself love tall ladies. I think its very sexy.
Can I walk up and kiss you
I fucking LOVE your shoes!!!!! 😍😍😍
The outfit goes so well, you definitely make tall look sexy
tall girls remind me of she-ra and models, so to me you're the perfect height, also... ur like rlly pretty
My boss at work is 6ft1 and when she wears boots/heels she just looks like she's owning it more. Go for it, it's an asset to be sure.
You get a girl do you do you wish you the best thing to do year hope you have a wonderful 2021 wish you all the best
Tall women are beautiful!
A lot of people love tall women, the rest are FUCKING WEAK.

Sweetheart you are absolutely breathtaking, as a shorter person myself I admire your height!! Stand proud! <3
you are UNBELIEVABLY GORGEOUS and i love ur skirt
Lean into it
Amazon. Absolute goddess.
Not sure how tall you are, I have a cis female friend who that is 5’11,” and she loves wearing heels as much as possible. Enjoy your height, girl!
HELL YEAH
You go sis! 6ft 3 girl here, gotta love that model height 💖
I love tall women
Sis, you look amazing!
You look gorgeous and it’s great to be more confident in yourself!  I wish I were that confident in my height, but this egg just cracked a month ago, so I hope things will improve.
tall.......ethereal......
yeah with legs like that you have nothing to worry about, they are gorgeous, you look stunning.
tall is cool! if ur dysphoria/anyone tells you women cant be tall, thats not true! i've met so many tall women, many of whom im pretty sure were cis anyways! i wish i had broad shoulders ;n;
Beautiful!
Yup same with me but I am grateful to Mother Nature for gynecomastia, even before my transition I enjoyed havin boobs and strangely enough was never the topic of bullying I just owned it and me and my friends would hype tf outta them to all the girls (8th grade)
That was/is awesome! Gave me goosebumps
Heck yeah!
Maybe, but there's a difference between tall girls and being 6'5"". I literally can't walk through doorways without crouching while wearing those heels.
""She's got leeegsss.""
And yes, this young Lady does too! I'm 5'9"", and have no problem with my Lady being same height or taller. I just smile at those with the ""WOW!"" eyes, knowing she IS WITH ME!
It's fun finding clothes huh? You pull it off very well <3

“And how” little rascals yep I’m old!!!
However you candy?
I actually have the same condition, but I was bullied viciously for it in middle and high school. It made me hate my body with a burning passion, for the longest time I wanted manly biceps like the guys who bullied me in gym.

Now at 23 years old, I moved from Kansas to California, and there’s no one to care about the shape of my boobs. And yeah, it helps me look a teensy bit more fem, haha

I totes get what ur sayin
At 6’2 I understand the struggle! You look gorgeous girl!
Then wrap those legs around me, let’s go!
[deleted]
Thanks! Which is your favourite? Any others I should read?
Oops my mistake, you look stunning! Love how much that dress flatters your figure!
I live in Florida and I mean, a couple people tried but me and my friends would just act like they were so fucking cool it would make whoever was being an ass so uncomfortable
6’2” here as well!

Ur girl just had top surgery today! I’m so happy!!		"congrats!! you look so amazing during your recovery period i'm jealous ;~; i hope the healing goes smoothly!!
Wow you great and so happy
Congrats!!!!!
Congratulations!  Good luck as you continue your journey!
Aww. So freaking cute!
Pain wise how is it?
Congrats!!! I love your hair
That's great! You look gorgeous!
That's amazing and you look stunning I really like your style ^-^
Ngl your tits look great and I'm happy for you, good one ya
You look great! Proud of you!
OH MY GOD! THAT’S SO FANTASTIC! I’M SO HAPPY! How does it feel? Did that hurt much? How are you feeling about it?! THIS IS MAKING ME SO HAPPY EVEN THO I DON’T KNOW YOU!
Can’t wait to get rid of my uterus, someday I’ll know what it feels to have the surgery!
I’m agender and I won’t do the top surgery, bc my breasts don’t bother me that much anymore.
But I hate having a uterus and it makes me dysphoric to know that I could give birth, to bleed once a month (it reminds me that I have a fkn gender) and sometimes I get a mental-induced pain that makes me think someone is stabbing me. Ugh.
Congratulations
It looks like you're also ready to unleash some anime samurai sword magic too, seeing as you came out looking like a kick ass anime character.

Tl;Dr Congrats, and i'm so jealous
A good friend of mine had hers not long ago aswl, so happy for you as well! Not sure if I'll ever feel the need for it myself, I suppose it depends how I feel after at least a year or two of hrt x
Looks like you've added quite a bit.  Good for you!
If you need someone to caress them please I am here at your beckoning call
So happy for you and wish you all the best, altought that smile already says everything,  rest well and hugs
Pure inspiration, congrats!
congratulations! you look great!
My ex went through surgery, she was in pain for so long, but the results were amazing. As long as you trust the doctor you chose, you'll love the outcome of the painful process that can be beauty.
Congrats! You look so refreshed for someone who just had surgery :o i would look dead
I’m so happy for you!!!!
Congratulations! I’m proud of you ❤️
Try taking melatonin before the pain pills when you want to sleep. Helped her a lot. Weed helps too lol.
Congratulations :)
🤩💖💚💙
Aw thanks! You are too sweet!
I am in so much pain because I went from a natural small A to an Implant D cup. But the pain meds are helping.
Thank you!!! It started going grey about 5 years ago so I’ve been bleaching it white ever since.
Omg thank you!
Hrt hardly did anything to my boobies so I definitely am happy getting a boob job!
Yeah I went from a small A to a D cup so definitely a big change haha
Hahaha thank you! A surprisingly large amount of people have offered that lol!
Yeah the pain is almost unbearable. I haven’t slept and it hurts to move but it’s going to be so worth it.
Awe thanks! I think I look dead but it kind of you to say I look refreshed!
That’s so kind of you to say! Thank you!
Ouch ;~; I hope once you're all healed up you enjoy your new bigguns!
Well my hands are aren’t like others sweetheart
Yeah meant to post that here loll, it'll be okay. Indecision by sampha and mount everest by labyrinth help can make good mood music for this monent.
Melatonin before pain pills can help when trying to sleep. A little weed if you have a low tolerance works as well.

SOMEONE CALLED ME SIR TODAY!!	"(FtM closeted)
So I was in a restaurant with my family when suddenly a waiter came in and said to me
“Shall I get your dish, sir?”
It made me feel so happy, winter is officially my favorite season. All the layers make my chest look smaller."	"Nice story😀
First off Congratulations! Secound off I think u got FTM and MTF mixed up :P
Congratulations! It's always a nice feeling to get gendered correctly, especially when not really trying. I (mtf) got a ""ma'am"" today at the store and am still riding that high, so I know how great you must feel!
Ah yes! It's the best season indeed 🥰
Did you mean FtM?
That’s awesome
Nice one, have a good day sir. From ally (got an FTM little bro and surf here to learn for myself and support you lot too).
Hurrah!! 😄🙌🌈🎉
LIttle victories are still victories.  Have an upvote
so happy for you!! i love the winter months too!!!
YAYYY!!! Congrats!
LETS GOOOOOO KING
For a good minute I thought you were in a restaurant bathroom and was so fucking confused lol.
If you aren't out to their parents, did they say anything? I know a trans friend who got correctly gendered as sir by the waiter but his grandma corrected the waiter by saying ""she""
Same thing happened to me yesterday, it feels amazing! Hope you can keep riding those highs!
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you. Maybe one day someone will call me a sir too..
Congratulations!
I'm so happy for you!!!!!
Nice job
That's awesome!
Oh, thanks for letting me know
did the OP edit it? because ftm is correct
Yes thank you
Thank you for caring about your brother so much! This makes me so happy!
yeah they did
Gotcha! Glad you got called sir, I love that feeling
oh ok thanks x"	rll7ld	trans	1129	0.99	2021-12-21 18:44:28
CAME OUT TO MY DAD TODAYYYY	So I was scared because we don't talk too much and I thought he would be really conservative, but he is supportive!!!! Of course, he doesn't understand it very much but he says I'll always be his daughter (And well, that's okay to me now since I just told him lol). And I'm just happy! I hope he can address me as his son in the future. There's a lot to do!	"Nice!
My dad said basically the same thing, “you’ll always be my son”. Im mtf.
He was introducing me as his son, quite deliberately and repetitiously up until that became untenable. Thank god i respond to estrogen, cuz the only thing making him use my preferred name  is that I’m passable and he knows it. 
It’s taking some patience but he is slowly adjusting.  it takes work from both of us to reach out and connect. And I’ve had to let a lot of things go for the moment, like misgendering, referring to me as his gay son, being kind of a dick and dismissive of my ex bf. I could tell it’s not necessarily because he’s a bigot, but that he’s just never once thought about trans issues or how we relate to the world. 
So be patient, try not to yell at him to much when he says outright bigoted things 😂 
You’ll catch more flies with honey.
He’ll still do most anything for me. Im his child. And for that im incredibly thankful.
Mine did the daughter thing too-- Eventually I got stubble and it made _them_ look weird to be calling me daughter when I very visibly had was a guy, or at the very least had some kind of gender thing going on, lol.  It just became a point where they have to address the topic less to people we come across if they actually respect my identity, lol.

People who are otherwise supportive and loving will come around on those things once they either realize the inconsistency for themselves, or it starts making them look like the oddball.  I'm glad it's going well so far!
Congrats!!!!   So happy for you!
Happy for you ❤️❤️
My dad also initially responded with ""you'll always be my son"", but it wasn't in English so I believe he meant that I'll always be his descendant (there's just no way to say it in Hebrew that isn't specifically gendered and he JUST found out, he wasn't ready for me to be his daughter quite yet). Nowadays he consistently addresses me as his daughter and rarely gets it wrong (which is fair enough, I get it wrong occasionally as well).
Congrats! :D
My parents said the same thing, “you’ll always be my son and I’ll always love you,” but they have done nothing but misgender and say that trans people are delusional… I’m so sick and they’re saying these things with two NBs, you’d think they’d learn, but no. I’m pretty sure my sibling has given up on it cause they haven’t talked about it much with the family, I didn’t even realize/know until I told them, even though they changed their name literally 5 years ago. Sorry for the rant I’m just so sick of being misgendered by my parents a few of my friends, and my being pan/demi is never thought of by my parents and a few of my friends getting weirded out by.
so happy u got through that, ur dad has to come to his own conclusions, he should do some research in that area and let him understand it himself, that’s exactly what my dad did after he saw how upsetting. and miserable my life was, he’s much better now! hope ur journey is as short and beautiful man

Thank you! I needed some motivation, I feel like shit constantly.
I aint planning to come out,but not to give up eighter.i feel like my only hope is them to find out,or me,doing it when i have my own home,all alone,so that no one will know that i changed my gender.but at tge sane time,i want to come out,idc if im ""too young"".
That awesome!! Good for you, for being brave and believing in yourself!!

I love this for you!

Hey my love I’m having surgery with Dr Sutin approaching, booked for March, was wondering if you had PI or Sigmoid colon vaginoplasty? And how you found your experience please? I want my mum to come with me x
HRT means Hormone Replacement Therapy. Traditionally estrogen (E) and antiandrogens (testosterone blockers) are given to AMAB (assigned male at birth) individuals and testosterone (T) is given to AFAB (assigned female at birth) individuals. And SRS means Sexual Reassignment Surgery, which can include a variety of different procedures for people with in the transgender and non-binary community.

Also, welcome! Always nice to meet an ally.
Exactly what the other person already said. :) And thank you! I find it amazing to see allies out here just supporting us. Means the world. You're doing gods work
HRT is Hormone replacement therapy 
SRS is sex reassignment surgery also known as GRS genital reconfiguration surgery
It took a long, long time and there was a lot of pain in between, but it's possible. You can do it ♡ I wish you all the best. And thank you :)
Try taking a look at r/Transgender_Surgeries! There are a lot of people on there who post their results. I personally, both functionally and aesthetically am incredibly happy with my result and there are some really great ones out there. Just gotta go with the right surgeon :)
So it actually looks like a afabs part?
Depends on the technique, but there are quite a few results that are cis-passing. I'm happy to say I'm in a similar boat.
Im happy for you. I just have one more question tho and its a bit more sensitive so mind if i ask it?
Feel free to ask away, I'm pretty open regarding that stuff :)
I found a video on the hub (Ik it’s unfortunate it’s the only place we can really turn to as far as I know) of a trans woman explaining the process, the feel, and answering questions on the topic and it wasn’t really sexual at all besides her having her vag out to show and explain things and the usual “don’t feel discouraged if you can’t climax the first few times it’s a whole different process” and I think she’s doing more videos on it so if u want to ask questions it’s probably a good place to do so. And for anyone questioning my motives I’m transfem and was curious myself and found exactly what I was looking for, an informative but not sterile and clinical veiw of gender affirmation surgery
Thanks. I was just wondering what about pleasure? And orgasms? Im curious to know.
Ah... i mean i might look it up...
I've had bottom surgery about 3 years ago now, I can absolutely achieve orgasms, and it's absolutely sensate and pleasurable.
Still a bit early in the healing process for that, but I can already tell I'll definitely be able to have both once I'm a bit further along. Once I'm at the 2 month mark that should work just fine!
Is it different from pre srs?
Omg i can only dream of achiving a female orgasm
Personally? Yeah. I'm actually able to get off with my husband, which is something I actively couldn't do pre-surgery. I could finish by myself both pre and post, but being with him is something else honestly, it feels _ENTIRELY_ different, and I don't think I could adequately explain why.
That sounds incredible. Mind if i ask where the testicles go? Just into the garbage or?
HAHAHA omg, they do yeah, I even asked the surgeon in Thailand if I could have them as a souvenir and he gave me a strange look!

I really should have asked my surgeon if I could have had my skull fragments put into something as well, too bad I didn't remember to do that :("	r9u0cn	trans	1123	0.99	2021-12-06 00:39:09

Happy Trans Day of Visibility all you beautiful people	I just wanted to say that I love all of you, you're all beautiful, and you're all valid as fuck. Happy Trans Day 😎	"I wish I could say the same, but the knowledge at what today is just makes me want to cry, but be unable to. I can't be visible; I live in a transphobic area, and can't come out to my parents yet, and the knowledge that I can't tell them just yet hurts.
Let's also make sure to share this with everyone else on the gender spectrum aswell! Even if they don't use the trans label they deserve visibility too!

Nonbinary, Agendered, Genderfluid, Genderqueer, 2spirited, Trigendered, and more! We are all in this fight to be who we are together.
Happy Trans Day of Visibility to you!
This day is kind of bittersweet for me. I came out to my parents on Sunday and not only did they say ""not while you are living with us"" (I've been with them since the pandemic started) but since then they have made zero effort to use my name or pronouns. It hurts, but I'm glad that I'm finally making steps towards being visible. Hopefully when I move out in a month, I can start being my true self even moreso.

Happy Trans Day of Visibility to every one of you on the gender spectrum!!
Wooo! Happy trans day! decided today was a good day to come out as transgender and bisexual so here I am now! visible!
Disadvantage on stealth checks today
I'm thinking of coming out, I literally have the note in my hands, I just have to give it to my mom. This is really terrifying. But happy trans visibility day
what's a ""trans day of visibility""?
Happy trans day to you too! Hope you have a lovely day today!
And a happy Trans Day of Visibility to u! ❤
[removed]
Its going to be okie doki :) you are super duper valid and gorgeous ❤💚❤💛💛❤💗💓💙💖💕❤
I'm sorry, girl 😟
This day is also to celebrate those of us who can't come out yet. 

from the Human Rights Campaign website

"" *we must recognize and remember that there are many trans and non-binary people in this country, and across the globe, who are not able to safely live their lives as their full selves, as well as those who face discrimination and violence for living openly.* *Today and every day, we will fight for a world where all transgender and non-binary people are able to lives their lives as their full selves, free from discrimination.”*
Same here
Hang in there, the day will come
Same. Msg me if u wanna talk💙💖🤍💖💙
I have something very similar to your situation. But if you wanna talk feel free to msg me!! 🥰
🥰❤
A lot of us have parents that suck. Life definitely does get better when they can't control how you live. I wish you the best with moving out and living as who you really are!
Congratulations!!! 🏳️‍⚧️🥳
It is super terrifying, but it's such a relief once you come out. My parents aren't even accepting of me, but I don't have to hide who I am anymore.
Just a day to celebrate our existence and bring awareness to others of the hardships we face in our lives
Thank you!

Beautiful
Super cute, I'm kinda jelly 😋
These are the people that lift us up. Our happiness is what matters, not how we present our bodies to ourselves and the world.
Girl, I have to say you’re terrible at not mode lol you look very lovely 🥰
You lucky, lucky girl. Happy Thanksgiving as well as a very happy life.
Giiiirl boy mode is now just you with less tatas. You're so pretty! 😩
Gorgeous

You look adorable in pigtails I’m jealous omg
Wow, that's a glowup! I mean as a whole, i can see the genuine joy and excitement in your after image <3 That's beautiful and i'm so happy for you <3
You. Look. Amazing! If you don't mind me asking... you had very similar facial hair to me, during your early laser sessions while being in boymode, was it obvious you were having something done to your face? Like redness or weird dots of hair/patchyness?
MATT W
First of all, I lo e your hair and eyes, your eyes show how happy you are, like I can see in my daughter's eyes.  Only if my wife shared a little bit of the thinking with your partner, my life would be so much easier, she forces me to go back to boymode. :-(
Excited celebration hug?
Wow. I am glad you are happy. You are very beautiful. Plus go Current. Fellow KC resident here.
I hope you enjoy the new year and everything that it brings you.
The best part is I couldn't care less! I'm already out to HR, and my bosses, and a select few coworkers. The company-wide ""hey I'm trans"" email will be dropping before year's end :) I'm so fucking excited lol
Haha yeah I know, I know. It's fine tho. I'm like 95% socially transitioned. Just a few more coworkers to tell, and then that's it! That's everybody. I will finally be a grill.
Where?
Thank you!! I've been DIY-ing it so far. Mostly just trims & layers here and there to keep the mullet at bay while it grows out lol. I'll be fully out in like a month tho and then I will absolutely be getting a real haircut from a pro. [This is my target hairstyle.](https://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3-long-wavy-bob-with-bangs.jpg?w=500&ssl=1)
Heyyyyy don't laugh at me lol it's rude
It's okay, I cry about literally everything these days. The other day I was at the park chatting with some random mom whose daughter my daughter was playing with, and Random Mom started telling me this story about a miscarriage she had once before and it made me cry. In public. In front of a stranger that I met like 2 minutes ago lol. Thanks, estrogen!
Thank you! I really like the ""less is more"" approach. I am a mom so I figure why not do mom makeup lol. I'm boring maybe but I'm happy.
Thank you so much! I grew them myself.
I am lucky enough to have quite a few Matt-like people in my life. Very lucky.
This was supposed to say boy mode* lol
Yeah, the first 6 or so laser sessions were annoying. You don't see much hair reduction from the earlier sessions, but it still irritates your skin. The day after laser, each follicle would get kind of puffy / inflamed. Not to mention, laser actually slightly burns the end of each hair, so right after treatments the burnt hairs will actually look darker and larger-diameter than they did before the treatment. Shaving + laser leaves your skin damaged and open as well, so you need to wash very regularly, moisturize a lot, sleep on a clean pillowcase, and NEVER touch your face if you want to avoid breakouts right after laser. I was prone to them. 

All this is to say, yeah, for about 2 or 3 days after laser, my face would be a wreck. I made up excuses to wear masks, or I would schedule my sessions for Fridays so I could recover at home instead of having to go to work looking gross.

It looks pretty similar to razor burn though, in most cases. So people will just assume you did a bad job shaving and hurt your skin, or that you're just having a breakout. It looks like that. So they're not going to know you're doing laser. Don't worry. 

The good news is sessions 7 through 13 have bothered me waaaay less. I don't get breakouts, and the inflammation is minor enough that I can cover it up with foundation no problem. I'll have 18 sessions total, then I'm doing electrolysis. My face is almost completely clear after 13 sessions, but my upper lip has been really stubborn, and I *hate* having upper lip shadow in girlmode. Hate it. Lol. 

Hope that's helpful!
I'm sorry to hear that :( for what it's worth tho, my wife and I are separated. Sometimes you have to just do what's right for you.
Wow that's amazing congrats , I hope to be where you are someday , my wife didn't take the revelation that well so I'm taking things very slowly
Yeah I think you can safely throw that compression top out now, great legs btw!
Charcoal or sweet lady propane?
You're getting really close. Your target hairstyle will stand you in any case super beautiful 😊 have a nice day ❤️
That's so pretty, now I want that
It's crazy how we *know* hormones effect ppl, but living through hrt and experiencing the other side its like 😵‍💫

I'm FtM, and I love being on T and not feeling everything all at once. Your post was just so wholesome, hit me in the boy-feels. ☺️
Eh, miscarriages are horrific. I don't think it's out of place to cry over someone who just told you they went through hell. Hormones do make everything feel so intense, though.
You're a mom!!! This makes this post even sweeter!! You absolutely nailed it then 😂 I hope to become a parent (a father is my dream) someday too. Take care! :)
Thank you so much 💕 You’re an inspiration girl.
Oh shoot, I didn't know... I hope you are fine now. Let me hug you just in thoughts, for a moment. PM me if you need to talk with somebody.
Good luck 🤞
My love for Hank Hill demands that I go with propane.
Same! Saving that for later to show the stylist. Now I just gotta wait for my hair to grow out.
I love how we're just opposite sides of the same coin :) I've really loved actually having emotions for what seems like the first time. Even though it makes me a wreck sometimes lol. It makes me glad to hear that you're just as happy going the other way :)
I'm sure you'd be a wonderful dad :)
Thanks for the offer :) I'm doing okay. We ""broke up"" in September, so I've had plenty of time to process it already. I'm doing okay. Feels so weird to think of it like that - like a break-up. We were together for about 8 years. Three year old daughter together.

The good news is she's supportive of my transition, and trans people in general. We tried to make it work for about a year after I came out, but she said that she's just slowly been losing parts of me that she really loved (scratchy beard, hairy legs, deep voice, etc...). She's just plain ole straight. Not into women. And that's alright. I want her to be happy just as much as i want me to be happy. We're still really good friends, and coparents, and we care about each other a lot.

So it isn't all bad. The separation has gone incredibly smoothly. We're not fighting over money or belongings, because we both still genuinely want what's best for each other, and for our daughter. I still love her to death, and I always will. She is my family, and I am hers. Married or not.
Thank you :)
Taste the meat, not the heat.
I can’t wait to feel things for once 😅

My therapist has (I don’t want to say warned me), but has advised me that “E” unlocks a lot of emotions and I’m a pretty stoic person when I’m not a depressed mess.
This is exactly what my wife is saying (also straight). I also have a 3yr old daughter and 2nd on the way, so I am second guessing my journey. Your experience might just happen to be my experience. :/

I am thinking hard about where I want to push things and be comfortable in my own skin, and where my marriage doesn't end. I wish I could have both, but I am affraid that ain't happening. Sigh.
Hey, I know  you didn't ask, but I want to offer you this anyway - just my personal experience. My wife didn't take it very well when I came out either. The following 12 months, we tried to make it work. It was hard, and it ultimately didn't pan out, even though we both really really tried. She's just straight, and that's not something anybody should hold against her. We're still wonderfully close friends, and co-parents.

The point is though, as hard as it was coming to terms with losing my marriage, I have never doubted for a second that I made the right call. I wouldn't change a thing. I can't tell you what your identity is, but I will tell you to trust yourself. Don't forget that what you're doing is *valuing and loving yourself.* It can't be overstated how important (and difficult) that is. You deserve happiness, and your pursuit of it is not something you should ever feel guilty for.
Yup! Higher highs, and lower lows. It takes some getting used to, but it's honestly been one of my favorite parts of transition. I feel like a complete person now, emotionally.
I can't tell you what's best for you, but I *can* tell you that I have absolutely no regrets about how things panned out with my wife. I'm happier now that I ever could've been before. I wouldn't change a thing. Granted, I have some plusses going for me that not everybody does - I have supportive friends, a supportive workplace, and I pass okay for the most part in public. I also had the money to afford my healthcare needs. I'm not saying you need to have all of those, or even any of them, but those things all made my experience easier and objectively more positive, and I think it's important to acknowledge that instead of just saying ""yeah transition's great, you should try it"". Just trying to offer you unbiased perspective. Wish you the best of luck.
I absolutely know your 100% correct and I'm sorry to hear things didn't work out . Not going to lie I stalked your profile and was like oh wow she is living the life of my dreams with a fully supportive partner. My wife at first was fine with it , then hard no , now she has circled back to we can try . Honestly I don't have the strength right now to do this without my wife. I really do appreciate you for sharing your journey and for this reply.
💕😭
All those plusses are really good to have. Right now I may be just too stressed about it to objectively evaluate my situation. Thank you so much for your perspective. Wish you happy life.
You too hun 💜 if you're looking for something positive to do in the meantime, keep your eyes open regarding your friends and family. Pay attention. See who will love and support you once you start transitioning, if you do. Ask leading questions about trans/queer issues, etc... Seek friends that will stay with you.

A support system is something many trans women (and men) lack, and not having it can be fatal. Start building your team with this extra time you have. It'll be time incredibly well spent.

Godspeed, stay safe, and good luck!!"	z1rpx2	trans	1088	0.99	2022-11-22 11:56:47

I have not, I did go for a consultation for it with Dr Myers in Beverel Hills, but he said he could make some tweaks to things that bother me maybe but nothing he could do to really feminize me more, so I held off.

It is your body and should do what you want to make yourself happy with it and I am a stranger on the internet so i will happy be told to shut up. But honestly I don't think it will be worth it you already pass and you look great, and I couldn't see a way that it would improve how you look."	p0fywd	trans	1087	1.0	2021-08-08 14:47:54
Am I not trans? Help!	"I have been feeling like I'm trans for some time now. I have not been getting any serious body dysphoria, but I more thrived on the verbal validation of others.

Recently, I started seeing a psychologist (not because I'm trans) and we got to the topic of gender.

Now, she asks if anything happened to me when I was younger, and I recalled living with my grandparents for a while when my baby brother was born because my mother couldn't take care of the both of us at the same time.

And then she says: ""You want to be a boy because you saw your brother getting all the attention and got jealous."" 

I'm stumped. What the fuck does this mean?? I mean, the fact that I don't get body dysphoria but if people misgender me I get sad, and then this got me thinking - am I really transgender? 

I know this sounds dumb but am I just coping and cis? When I get therapy will I magically be okay with being a woman? Are my feelings invalid because of early childhood problems?

I swear, before this I was just a happy trans man, and now I feel like my feelings are wrong, I'm lying to myself, and I'm starting to doubt myself again. This is messing with my brain, and I needed to hear the thoughts of other trans folk.

tl;dr - my psychologist told me I was trans because I was ""jealous of my brother getting my parents' attention when I was younger"", and now I'm starting to feel doubt. Any thoughts?"	"Regardless of trans stuff, that’s just bad therapy. Therapists aren’t supposed to tell you their theories flat-out, they’re supposed to let you figure it out on your own. 

OP, if this idea she gave you doesn’t resonate with you and if it doesn’t sound true, that means it almost definitely isn’t. You know yourself better than she does.
Yea nah, that's bullshit. That's borderline conversion therapy, trying to make you believe you're faking it for attention.
Thats just bad therapy. Like other said, a therapist is meant to ask the right questions to help navigate you instead of telling you their own opinions and theories. Just because theyre called a therapist that doesnt automatically make them a proper therapist.
Ummmm yeah this has actually been historically the tactic used on gay people in conversion therapy: that the only reason they are gay was from some trauma as a child. This is obviously not true, and I doubt there is really any evidence this is the case for any gay people or trans people.

I once heard someone say this on trans issues: “if you have been contemplating whether or not you are trans for a while, it means you probably are”

I’d highly recommend talking to either another therapist, or maybe just ask around here on how other trans people feel. I always find that super helpful for getting someone to figure out their own gender identity imho.
At this point i almost want to ask, does it really matter if that is the reason? You say you feel better when spoken to as a boy, for me that is enough to say ""geat then I'll speak to you as a boy"". My own journey was one of discovering the things that made me happy and then labelling came afterwards. I feel happy when binding my chest, and presenting more masc and using the words he/him, so i do just that. It doesn't matter if that makes me cis or trans. I know it can be frustrating to maybe not completely fit in with one label, but in the end, it's all about what makes you happy.
I've been in a similar situation and not having dysphoria doesn't mean you're not trans, but just take your time figuring stuff out sometimes that's all you need and if you don't, ask people for help who you feel safe with or who will accept you. I hope you find what you're looking for.
CHANGE THERAPISTS RIGHT NOW. you are so valid.
You're valid and your therapist is talking shit. I have 2 kids (1 boy, 1 girl) and can guarantee you that kids don't even see gender. My son only started saying ""that's for boys/girls"" when he heard it from other kids at age 3/4 and didn't even form an idea of gender until 5/6. My daughter is 2 and has no clue about gender. If you were 1 you would not have been able to form a conclusion that your brother got your parent's attention because ""he was a boy and you weren't"" (assigned so, at the time, sorry to kind of misgender you there but timelines make it tough). Kids are genderless, in their own mind at least (for a couple years). We gravitate towards what we like. We grow into our gender. We only deny it when society tells us we don't fit its expectations. Sorry for the essay. If you are happy as a boy, then you're a boy.
I mean it‘s easy to answer, isn‘t it? How did you feel at that time, what was it like when you were with your gramdmother?  
How did you feel when you returned home?  
Do you feel the same now?
what kinda Freudian bullshit is this lol. get a new therapist
nah thats bullshit, your valid as heck and shes a bad therapist. 

this is actually a tactic that was used by people to “convert” gay people, they make them question the validity of their identity by saying that the reason why their trans/gay mustve been created from trauma.
Gender euphoria is generally a better indicator than gender dysphoria is. What makes you feel the best? Try some stuff out and see what works. It's all about exploration. You're valid regardless of what you decide is right for you <3
That's not even proper psychology. She is incredibly transphobic, and looking for reasons to tell you it's not real.
I’m not trans… 

But holy shit can I spot a bad therapist a mile away. I don’t know you. I don’t know them.

But a session with your therapist should not have you coming to a question board for emotional therapy, AFTER your therapy session.

Find someone who respects you first.
Your therapist is trash. They often are. Find a new one.
That’s almost like conversation therapy bruh, don’t listen to it and just take your time figuring it out on your own terms or with someone who is accepting, you should really stop seeing this person cause realistically this won’t help you figure out if ur trans or not if ur with someone who by the sounds of it doesn’t like or accept trans ppl
Like others have said, that's not appropriate in therapy. Therapists don't tell you your feelings are wrong and give their version of what's going on in your brain. 

I've struggled with doubts like yours. I've never had anyone say it to my face like that, but I have wondered if I'm not trans but just frustrated with the limitations of being a woman in society (I'm definitely trans). Also 5 years ago I thought I didn't have any body dysmorphia either. I think I was not in touch with my body, because that has changed. But, either way, you don't have to have body dysmorphia to be trans. 

Accepting that you are trans is such a vulnerable position to be in that it's no wonder we doubt ourselves. It might be one of the worst aspects of being trans. Don't feel down if you doubt yourself. I've found it's helpful to think of myself as non-binary. It's true -- I do feel non-binary -- but it also really takes the pressure off of phrases like ""wanting to be a boy"" --- you just wanna be you.
I'm a psychology student. Don't take psychoanalysts (Freud's line of psychology) too seriously, they tend to try to explain what you're feeling from some bullshit occurrence from your past, even though it might not make any sense. There's some truth in trying to find things out from the past, but senseless speculation doesn't get it anywhere. It's always things that apparently make sense, but that can't be proved or disproved. Sure it makes logical sense (?), but that can't in a million years be taken as definitive proof to what you're feeling.

But there is also the possibility that your psychologist is just not educated enough on trans stuff, and that they didn't realize how harmful that comment could be. Maybe they didn't know that you're born trans, and tried to give it an explanation, but still totally support you as trans. In the sense that they were not trying to actually deny your trans identity
Nobody knows why people are trans, because it's not an easy topic. 

I know other people have said that the therapist is practicing bad therapy here, but let's hear the therapist out.

What if you are jealous of your brother and wanted to be a boy because of it? You are now an adult who feels happier as a man than you did as a woman.

That's the bit that's functional and meaningful to who you are. Nothing in your past invalidates who you feel like you are today. You are who you are, and you being a man makes you happy.
This bothers me on so many levels. As a trans person, it feels incredibly reductive to reduce something as complex and life-encompassing as identity to a single childhood incident. They're treating your trans identity as a trauma symptom, which is incredibly offensive.

As a trainee therapist, I hate hearing about counselors who allow their ideology to override their professional standards of care. This is the opposite of strengths-based and client-centered; they're treating your identity as a problem rather than a source of strength and telling you what to think rather than letting you take the lead. This person has no business working with queer clients if this is how they approach it.
completely regardless of your transness or lack thereof that is a major therapist red flag
If this were possible, there would be a *lot* more people mistakenly identifying as trans, which we just don’t see. 

You, sir, are almost certainly trans.
Yep, most people already said it, you should either change therapist or just not discuss this with her at all. Dysphoria isn't a requirement for being trans, if you feel like you are a man, then you are a man.
Even if that were true, and it sounds like bullshit, but even if that were, why would it effect who you are now? Regardless of the root cause, you still feel gender euphoria, you still enjoy being referred to as a boy and presenting as such. That doesnt change because your psychologist has a theory. Focus on who you are now, not who you might have been as a child. The child isnt living your life, you are
The best thing someone told me is that gender euphoria is much more important than dysphoria. Feeling good about where you are is much more important than feeling like where you’re at is wrong.

In regards to the therapist, either change or try new another one. If lots of them say the same thing, you might’ve been “jealous” of the attention, but there’s many more steps between “jealous of brother” and “I’m a trans man.” It’s not the “cause,” but it could have opened a new hidden perspective that opened your mind. Childhood memories manifest in mysterious ways. Just know that wanting to be a boy isn’t a bad thing.

At the end of the day, this is about you. Don’t shoehorn yourself into being cis or trans. It’s a long journey, and you can switch back and forth to find that perfect middle if needed.
Everyone else straight up shared my thoughts on gtfa from that psycho.  When I started seeing a therapist because I was worried I was only identifying as trans because I was having a manic episode or something she told me that only I could know that, but did tell me I just seemed happy and I did not seem to be presenting the symptoms of a manic episode.
You need a new therapist/psychologist. You definately are trans, and even if you weren't, that's just bad psychology. Your psychologist isn't you, so they should never be telling you how things made you feel
This is a tactic people have used against gay people for ages. It's the classical ""something must have gone wrong in your childhood and that's why you THINK you aren't straight"".
It's nothing less than a discriminating heteronormative (society expecting everyone to be cis and heterosexual) narrative.
Psychologists should never invalidate your feelings. Have her point you to the research that says being transgender is caused by childhood experiences. As far as I'm aware, no such research exists.
The therapist shouldn't be saying things like that; it sounds like she doesn't understand the trans perspective. I recently had this problem too when looking for a therapist and I realized that even if you aren't going to therapy for trans related issues, it can be a problem that your therapist doesn't ""get it"" for this very reason. If her comment left you saying, ""What? Huh? I feel that way? Really?"" Then it's probably not right. She may be a professional, but without that perspective, she is looking through a biased lens at your problems and offering solutions to what she perceives as a cis woman with trauma. 

At the end of the day, you know yourself the best; you're valid regardless of any opinion, professional or no. Hope you feel better soon, and I hope that this was just a professional blunder on your therapists part.
Regardless of anything, therapists aren't supposed to do that. That exact theory is so full of bullshit that I can't begin anywhere on her thing.
I'm a pre everything trans man and I have almost no disforia (I can't spell and auto correct sucks) but oh boy do I get uforic when people see me as a man. I was smiling all day after some called me brother and I'm depressed as fuck and rarely feel anything other than meh so that day solidified me being trans. Btw what your therapist said sounds like something a shitty tv therapist who was written by someone who hasn't gone to therapy. Please look for a therapist that fits you better.
The absence of dysphoria doesn’t mean you’re not trans.  Focus on the euphoria you get from gender affirmation.  Even if your feelings about your gender were shaped by this event in your early childhood (I’m not saying they were), it doesn’t invalidate the feelings.  There are many ways to look at gender identity. Some say the soul has gender and that it can differ from your physical sex, while others say that the body is simply a canvas for us to make of it what we wish.  I prefer the latter, being agnostic and preferring not to put a definition on the soul.
Your therapist is not a good therapist. You're a man because you were born a man and will stay a man. It's not like you were female and then you became a boy because of your brothers, you're a man and you are valid and you deserve a better therapist. *hugs*
Hello me from whenever I grow enough balls to ask my mom for a therapist (not because of trans things as well). I'm not in your situation yet but remember that not every trans person has body dysphoria also I don't know about you but I did some really egg like things before I found out about that I'm probably trans, to give examples of my own life: I wore dresses to school twice before finding out I'm trans (I'm transfem), in 7th grade I held a presentation about gender swapping in video games, I mostly played female characters in video games. Those examples might not apply to you but maybe you can think of something that you did in the past
that's some of the worst psychology I've ever seen
Please don't speak to that person anymore thats incredibly unprofessional. No life experience can ""cause"" you to be transgender or experience gender dysphoria. You are just trans. Thats all. That person is not only reaching for the stars but is incredibly misinformed and hurting others in the process
Your therapist is not well educated.
Trans is any discontinuity between gender assignment at birth (usually presumed by obvious sex characteristics), and how you feel inside (identity).

It is not required to be a consistent disparity through time.  It is not required to be validated nor negated by confounding or causal factors.

As to the therapist, they are supposed to guide you through your own thought discovery, and not define things for you.  A supposition, “maybe” or “could it be” is the more proper wording from them.

If they are seeking agreement from you, that would be another problem.  If disagreement is a threat to them, that would also be a problem.  You should feel empowered to advocate for yourself, but not required to do so.

In the end, a therapist is someone you can talk about your inner struggles, secrets, etc., who will help you excavate the things you may not realize, or hide from.  If this gets you thinking, then maybe it’s effective.  Questioning yourself is an important part of self discovery.

But, they should have worded this differently.  You should be able to go back and say you are not sure you agree, or even if you do agree, that you can define which parts you actually struggle with vs do not.

Just my thoughts, and not any sort of professional opinion, etc.
Your therapist is probably full of shit, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're necessarily going to benefit from transitioning either. Take a little while to reflect and talk to a different therapist, preferably who specializes in gender therapy
You don't have to have dysphoria to be trans!  I'm sure other comments mentioned that as well but it's so important to remember.  You are valid and you know yourself way better than that therapist.
Oh no freudian psychology
I can’t tell you if you’re trans or not cuz I don’t know a whole lot about you, but it based on the fact that you had no doubts before and you genuinely feel uncomfortable being misgender, it seems like you most likely are trans since the only thing that made you doubt yourself is what your therapist said.

A lot of trans people do struggle with thoughts that they’re “faking” and “just doing it for attention” so you’re definitely not alone! I’d suggest maybe talking to people who have similar thoughts and see what they may do to reassure themselves that they’re trans! 

Lastly, I wanna add that no matter if that’s the reason or not, the fact that you do feel like a boy right now is what’s important. If you do come to the conclusion that you aren’t trans, that’s fine! But for now you do feel like a boy, and as I said, that’s all that really matters!
Do you see yourself being a women in ten years? Do you want everyone to call you she? If the answer is no to those questions then you’re probably trans but just to solidify it.
 Do you want to be your brother or be his brother?
Your therapist is a human piece of shit garbage asshole. You do not need dysphoria to be trans and anyone who thinks that is scientiffically wrong. And also a transphobe. If you think you are trans. You are trans. That's not something anyone but you can decide. Even if they are a therapist. Therapy that makes you more insecure is not therapy. That's bullshit. Sorry for the anger but I genuinenly hate people like that. It just makes you feel like shit. And that's no good.
Ok I can’t tell a lot about trans stuff because I’m still figuring it out myself but one thing I can say is your feelings are NEVER invalid and if you ever need someone to talk to and don’t have anyone close to you to do so (and this goes for anyone) reach out to me
Ignore the therapist. Find a new one.

Only 1 thing determines if you are trans: Do you want to be a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth?

If yes, you are trans. Doesn't matter what else is going on socially or in family dynamics. If you answer yes, you're trans.
If you have no dysphoria of course you’re ‘coping’ with something. You even said it yourself, you thrived off the verbal attention. There isn’t anything wrong with experimenting with your identity or seeking validation.

>I swear, before this I was just a happy trans man

If you were happy, then be happy. If you are trans or not boils down to what you are happy doing. Your therapists sounds kinda transphobic tbh bc she straight up said that you’re not trans. Being trans isn’t something you can tell by looking at someone or even licensing to someone’s whole life story, it’s something only you can figure out if you are or not, if you were happy be happy.
Your psychologist is full of shit, plain and simple. It honestly almost sounds like a retread of old Freudian bullshit - fucking penis envy, for gods' sakes.

You don't want to be a boy because you're jealous of *anyone*. You want to be a boy because you ARE a boy. Dysphoria is complicated and can be hard to unravel when you've been dealing with it for so long it's become background noise that you've learned to automatically filter out. Plus gender is a complicated fuck period. Lack of body dysphoria(or inability to identify such) isn't particularly meaningful.

^((Also ""sad from being misgendered"" is a type of dysphoria, even if it's not body dysphoria.))

That ""thrived on the verbal validation of others"" thing though? That's called gender *euphoria*, the opposite of dysphoria, and it's a pretty good indicator that you are in fact trans.
what kind of freudian bullshit is that psychiatrist on?? drop that bitch as soon as you can. what shes doing is borderline conversion therapy and if you let that go on for a longer period of time you will most certainly get some scars.

and to answer your primary question, if you were happy as a transman and felt good about being reffered as a man then you are a man. not everyone feels dysphoria the same, i myself hardly feel it sometimes but someone else might feel it in a much stronger fashion. what you're experiancing is a light version of imposter thoughts, you know the ""oh i just like x because x im not trans lol"" most trans people have had them a few times in their lifetime. i've had them like twice but thats about it

edit: side note as well, a one year old does not get the thought

""oh my brother gets more love and attention than me, i should be a boy so i can get more love and attention as well""

that just does not happen. and while im not incredibly well versed in childrens psychology i am well versed in adult psychology. (been having classes for 3 years and still going) and something i do about childrens psyche is that thoughts like that are not only rare but also borderline impossible, a child would think

""why is my brother getting more love than me? did i do something wrong?""

then from that you'd be feeling guilt instead of gender insecurity like tf is that psychiatrist on?? im legit fumin babe oh my god

edit2: and now that im thinking about it even more like what the fuck??.

im guessing you're over the age of 15? making you an adult in terms of psychology, so why the fuck is you ADULT PSYCHIATRIST making statements about a CHILDS psyche. oh. my. god. this is so fucked what the hell??? im so sorry you had to go through this absolute dogshit behaviour from a psychiatrist.
That's not a therapist. I don't know what the fuck is up with therapists on the topic of genders, but what they said it's bullshit. If you feel like a trans man, you are a trans man. No changing that
Nothing wrong with being a boy with boobs, and also if that were the reason you would have wanted to be a boy at the time. Like, my kid wants to be a baby because their sibling just got born. Perfectly reasonable. If they come to me in nine years and tell me they want to be a baby, I’m pretty sure the cause would be something else. 

But also, even if that were truly a reason, so what? Wouldn’t make you any less a boy now.
I'll easily put a bet that your therapist is some kind of religious nut too. That is a ""conversion therapy"" response. If it was a sister it would have been - ""You want to be a boy because you were jealous of your sister and therefore resent women as a whole"". If you parents were divorced and you lived with your Dad it would have been because you have had a male upbringing. If you lived with your mum it would have been because you didn't have a male figure and looked to fill that role. It's ridiculous and stupid. Your therapist/psychologist is shit at their job. Tell them to get stuffed and find a better one.

That therapist is a piece of shit. Fire her as your doctor if you are able and find someone competent who doesn’t have hate in their heart.
Therapist here—

This person is not trans informed, is not sex positive, and doesn’t seem like they are trained in sex therapy.

Most people don’t realize that most therapists receive almost no training in sex therapy or LGBTQ+ issues.

You need a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues, and hopefully someone who is a certified sex therapist.

Ask your therapist for a referral to a LGBTQ+ therapist and one who is preferably sex therapist certified. She is out of her depths and needed to refer you because clearly she is not trained.

Or, you can look for one yourself! There are many out there! You can even go directly to the AASECT website (certified sex therapist website), they have a list of providers who are certified. 

Source: I am a therapist and specialize in sex therapy. Literally the first thing they teach us in sex therapy certification is that it is a myth that trauma is related to LGBTQ+ status. Just because trauma and queerness are present doesn’t mean they are the cause of each other.
That’s bad therapy my dude. Therapist arnt supposed to just mike drop things like that even if they are true. So I wouldn’t take what she is saying as super credible.
Not every trans person has dysphoria! You’re valid
Bad therapist, find a person who has experience or specializes in gender identity therapy. It's not about finding the people who will say what you want to hear. Being told what they told you is bullshit. This therapist trying to lead you into thinking that aligns with their views not yours. Therapist should never try to lead a client like this. 

My therapist never told me I was as transgender or what my identity was or why I felt the way I did. What they did was help me unpack and unclog the bullshit layers of societies expectations, fears of retaliation and rejection, and self loathing from internalize homo/transphobia until I was finally able to say with confidence who I was. They never told me I was right or wrong, they never tried to justify why I felt this way only to help me understand what I was feeling.

Get a better therapist, they are human and can't be expected to know everything. Avoid therapist who aren't specialized or focused. There are no Masters of All.
That sounds like you need a new therapist. Look for specifically trans-friendly therapists.
1. As a healthcare professional, I’m going to use the magic words…”second opinion!”

2. Unless you’ve been living in some PollyAnna world that is only inhabited by nyan cats spreading rainbows across the sky… you know what kind of attention we are most likely to get…. does the psychologist think something happened to you that was so bad that you would want the often negative attention of strangers?

3. Don’t know your grandmother. But in my family one of my afab and cis cousins was primarily raised by our grandmother. You know what? She is the one enjoying her life. Literally the happiest of all of us. She likely got more attention from grandma than we did from out parents.

4. Like physicians, and nurses, mental health professionals have specialties. This one sounds like she stuck back in DSM-3 where being trans was considered mental illness. If she claims to be a gender expert, she’s not a very good one. I would seek out a mental health professional who actually specializes in gender issues. I have one who specializes in substance abuse, gender and trauma. I don’t need the first but the second and third are fantastic for me. She helped me to make up my own mind, and then gave me her opinion, which was to validate what I decided.
Sounds like you need a new therapist ASAP. Try to find one who is allied with the trans community!
I would already be looking for another therapist, that was dismissive and unprofessional on their part.
Wow, that’s quite the leap your therapist is making. If they seriously thought you experienced some kind of unprocessed trauma and wanted to help you work through that then there are constructive ways of doing that without adding another crisis on top of whatever else you’re dealing with. 

This aside, 1) I don’t think that there’s medical consensus on the idea that being trans is necessarily a trauma response. 2) Say it is some kind of coping mechanism, does that fundamentally change things? People are trans for all kinds of reasons, some social, some physical, some political, etc. Why would the root of **your** transness invalidated that identity? Why should it make you “not really trans” when you experience similar joys and pains to countless other trans people?  3) What is her goal in trying to identify why you are trans, and why is she telling you her theory? The only thing I can think of is that she’s trying to “cure” your transness, and that’s incredibly dangerous. From here I’d imagine she is going to try to logic you out of being trans and use her position of authority and superior knowledge in the field of psychology to convince you that you’re wrong about what you know about yourself. 

This isn’t worth the headache or the heartache. I’d say to just get another therapist.
shit therapist shouldn’t have a license
Well its possible its true i would get a 2nd opinion and also discuss your ""trans confusion"" with  specialized therapist. More importantly don't stress yourself over this people are complex and trauma makes things worse and no one is even near perfect so don't beat yourself up trying to please others
Yeahh, you should get a new therapist
Transphobic therapist
I and nobody, but You can't answer if You are trans or not. Ask Yourself if You feel comfortable with Your gender, or not. No therapist can answer that for You.
I think the therapist You're seeing has some... Weird idea that people become trans, because of trauma, or something. But it's a guess, because statement like that is... Well... Weird at least. But idk think about it. Remember that therapist doesn't know You better than You know Yourself. And they might point You to directions, but ultimately it's You who's got to help Yourself.
That was completely inappropriate of your practitioner to say. Dump them, and find someone new who doesn't assume and jump to erroneous conclusions.
Yeah no your psychologist is full of shit. What they're saying sounds somewhat Freudian and Freud was full of shit too. You don't have to have gender dysphoria to be trans, you only have to have gender euphoria when identifying as a gender other than the one you were assigned at birth. If being a man gives you euphoria, congrats, you're trans!
Don’t search for gender Dysphoria  search for what makes you (gender) euphoric, because we often try to tell ourself nah thats not Dysphoria but it is. By finding stuff that make you euphoric, you get a more positive viewpoint of yourself 😇
never take the advice about who you are from anyone but yourself, you may not be trans one day and that's okay but if you right now think you are, and feel more comfortable being so then you are valid and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
If the thought of you being not trans makes you anxious, you're trans.
Many cis people have a thought, ""what if im trans?"" But if the thought of you maybe not being trans makes you anxious, you're probably trans.
Btw, it seems like you're mainly experiencing social dysphoria, which is valid. I mainly experience one aspect of body dysphoria which is my chest. Although, I've had an odd gender experience since I have PCOS. When I began to get on birth control to average out my hormones, I began experiencing dysphoria. Apologies for talking about my experiences a bit.


Which makes you most comfortable, most euphoric? Being called a guy, a girl, or a they?
My old therapist tried to say the same thing, but tried saying that since I have ptsd from stuff my cousin and a pedo did that I was probably just using being a boy as a way to keep myself feeling safe. My new therapist though has been very clear that that isn’t a cause of feeling like the opposite gender at all.
Usually, if you're worried that much about faking, you're not faking. You know better than anyone else and even if it can be hard knowing, you're the only one able to tell who you are.
Your therapist either is fake or should be immediately relieved of their therapists’ license, and quite possibly jailed.  You know yourself better than your therapist does, and therapists are literally trained to let you figure everything out on your own with a bit of professional assistance here and there, not to figure it out for you.
A therapist should never tell you how you feel.

Drop them and report them
even if that is the reason, who cares?

If you are happier to identify as a boy, then you are a trans man. no matter how it came to be.

Its not like that's how it works anyway, people don't change their identity over attention. you get far more hate and difficulty living as a openly trans person than you would being cisgender. If you understand that then you aren't faking it.

This is a bigoted psychologist (weather subconsciously or as a conscious decision) trying to invalidate your gender identity. Gender identity is complex and strange and nobody quite knows how it happens or ""how it works"" you cant explain it away with jealousy.
Hot take: so fucking what? I'm gay because my mom didn't love me enough, I'm trans because I was raised religious and women were viewed as lesser. We are all products of our environment, and this cishet bullshit concept that being ""made gay"" is invalid while they simultaneously have conversion camps that try to ""make people straight"" the *exact same way* is disingenuous horseshit. Understanding why you are the way you are doesn't *change* the way you are, nor make it any more or less valid.
This is exactly why you only talk to a therapist that’s a gender identity specialist about gender identity issues. If they don’t, they have absolutely zero credentials to say anything.

What you’re therapist SHOULD have said was they aren’t qualified to give you guidance on this particular topic and looked into places that can.
You know yourself better than anybody! You just have to ponder on yourself and keep like minded people near you! Don’t let someone who went to school a couple of years throw your whole being off. Keep grounded! If you feel your HAPPIER as a trans man, that’s all that matters! We only have one life! Do what feels right for you! She obviously picked at some old wounds for you to be doubtful but don’t worry and continue to live as your authentic self! I too have had family issues and it really hurts. I understand in my own way how that feels. I have half sisters. They got all the attention as well. That doesn’t change who I am though. It does however make me a loving mother to my two girls. Keep your head high. Keep doing you dude!
You don’t need body dysphoria to be trans I’d seek a psychiatrist that specializes with gender identity !
The human brain is dumb... it only wants what it can't have because it's greedy.  

If you want to be transgender, then it tells you otherwise because one is always contradicting the other.  

Your feelings and your brain hate each and life is a constant, never-ending war of unsatisfaction.
That that's the first thing she said after hearing about one experience... That's not therapy, that's conversion, and you need to get the hell out of there. I'm really sorry this happened to you, I understand it must be incredibly confusing. Trauma can absolutely cause gender fuckery, but it's not at all the first go-to explanation for feelings like yours and it's definitely not something a therapist should be looking for (""how can I disprove this person is trans?"")
“If people misgender me, I get sad.” That’s dysphoria.
Your psychologist is full of it.
1. your therapist is a bitch 
2. not getting dysphoria doesn’t make you any less trans. i don’t get dysphoric about my genitalia, but that doesn’t make me any less trans
Honestly, who fucking cares if you are “really” trans, or if childhood trauma “made you” trans, both of which are bullshit— but even if they were true, if being a man makes you *truly* happier. That being a man feels better than being a woman ever did, and it is who you want to be, then you are a man.
Is sad so many psichologists are really bad professionals, I had problems with one of them because she called that I'm a trans woman just by hating men in general, so in her theory I hate men and of course can't be one. (I'm married with a cisgender man and very happy with him)
One of my favorite youtubers likes to say: if you think you‘re faking it, there‘s a pretty good chance you‘re not :)
Having dysphoria doesn’t equate to being trans. It‘s also not a cis thing to like being called the opposite gender, just saying…
What if a friend of yours told you a story like that? How would you react? Would you judge them and their feelings? 

PS: I‘m in a similar situation (little to no body dysphoria, pretty pronounced social dysphoria) and you really help me work through this, thank you!
Yea dude that's kinda dumb. I'm not a therapist or phycologist but I have been around plenty of people who want attention they lacked and they usually just fallow what they're told cause they seek approval and even if that therapist was somehow in your head knowing everything going on in there it's not ok to just tell someone oh yeah the way you live is invalid cause blah blah blah. I had it happen with my parents. I don't get why but it feels as if they just don't want you to feel comfortable. And on top of all of that not every trans person experiences the same thing this includes body dysphoria. Some people just get the euphoria side of it and that doesn't make them any less of themselves so for your therapist to be making such bold claims without knowing much on the subject is pretty unprofessional (I know it's sorta hypocritical to say this while not having official knowledge of psychology but I'm just saying that is that if you're making someone mentally battle themselves instead of helping that not happen you're not doing your job right so yea that therapist may be bias against you or she just doesn't understand trans people that well) hope that you have o good rest of your day bro.
If it's okay with you, I would really like to share this with my therapist and get their perspective on it. Bc this is bullshit and you need some validation.

To be perfectly clear, if you feel more comfortable as a male then that's what you are, no one else has any say in the matter.
Nah this is a homophobic trying to talk you out of it
Report this therapist, they are completely invalidating you with their bullshit “assessment”.
That “therapist” is total garbage. You don’t need to have body dysphoria to be trans! I once heard someone describe it as, if you somewhat tolerate vanilla ice cream, but love chocolate ice cream and feel super happy when you eat it, why would you stay with vanilla? No one can tell you you’re trans except for yourself!
Phsycologists r assholes in my experience, always enjoyed my sessions with therapists over ones with psychologists
A cis person wouldn't worry about being trans or not
Being trans isnt about hating what you were born with, it's about building yourself into something you love. Whether you get dysphoria or not doesnt determine your transness- I'm willing to bet you're exactly like me (and many, many other trans people) whose experiences are more shaped by gender euphoria (joy at your gender) rather than dysphoria.

I think many people, both within and outside of the trans community, focus too much on the pain of dysphoria rather than acknowledging the beautiful joy of euphoria and shaping your life and growing in a way you control. 

The way people outright ignore gender euphoria in many places sets a warped perspective towards trans people and how we 'should' experience our lives and connection to gender rather than seeing the true rainbow of diversity that all communities contain, which, sadly, tends to steer our siblings who don't fit into the mold of 'dysphoric trans person' away from the community.

I hope you find a better therapist my dude, and I hope you grow more assured in your own identity* as you march on into the future. (*whatever it may turn out to be and however many times it may change and adjust, cause life and labels really do like to play around, lol)
No cis person has those thoughts 😃
Yeah that's dumb. And, really, the concept of whether you're ""really trans"" or not is kinda silly too - all that matters in the end is that you feel happier as a man, and you're not hurting anyone by that. Why the feelings exist is pretty much irrelevant, if you feel them they're there and they're real and that's that
What the fuckl?!?!?!? 

Im absolutely appalled 

dump them
Oh, hell no. I don’t have dysphoria, only a little before I started T, now I’m fine. I don’t experience severe dysphoria my ex has. Don’t doubt yourself. You know yourself better than anyone in the entire world does, even if you’re still navigating. That psychologist doesn’t know shit. 

My mom did the same thing; she listed things out, and I doubted myself, but I was upset, so I wasn’t thinking straight, and later my mind became clear. I KNOW I’m a male, and my mom is anti-LGBTQ+. She’s religious.
your psychologist needs to have their license revoked.
Get a new therapist ASAP!! Look for one that specializes in trans issues.  They seem to be the most helpful in the subject of gender.  My therapist said that feeling of ""what if I'm not or feeling like I might regret it is normal.  She's helped me understand that that is my anxiety speaking and helped me realize that I've had suppressed memories of me trying to express my true gender
Yeah, that therapist is wrong. Social dysphoria is just as valid as body dysphoria (in addition to the fact you don’t need dysphoria to be trans) I’d say find a different therapist.
Nah you're trans  what a shitty psychologist
OP you need a new therapist that's all I have to say
I would counter with your psychiatrist. If you give up then they are right. They are just summarizing what you said. It’s open for debate if you like, or do you just wanna leave it at that? Don’t allow the medical fearmongering on Reddit lead you astray. Remember this is your business. If you are transgender and looking for a reason why then there is your answer. However, if you are trying to resolve your dysphoria there is your answer. Just bc you have gender dysphoria doesn’t mean you are transgender. So the opposite is true, as well. This is what medicine is good at. Weeding out your internet dives and misconceived notions you’ve gathered from the internet. As someone who has to drop their knowledge at the door I have trained myself to be a patient when I’m a physician, as well. Doctors make the worse patients so when you are diagnosing yourself physicians see that, and go with that. Leading you to get to your own answers. Take each session with a grain a salt bc it won’t be fixed in one session unless you want it to.
You should report this therapist for completely invalidating you with their bullshit “assessment”.
Let's put aside the fact that no one can tell you if you're trans or not, and \*let's say\* that it would be possible to feel that way bc of trauma. Even if we do that ""You want to be a boy because you saw your brother getting all the attention and got jealous."" is the worst, weakest and the most naïve take I could ever imagine.

This is actually one of the qualms I had with Jules' special episode on euphoria, where she's in therapy. At one point the therapist just kinda makes a connection and interrupts Jules instead of just letting her talk. Like childhood experiences are important, but I think even still a lot of Freudian-esque bullshit makes its way into media representations of therapy and even some actual therapy, trying to make some sort of profound connection instead of actually trying to address the issue.
This resonates a lot with me. I've started to think of my journey as the Marie Kondo Trans Experience. You basically start out by accepting ""these things spark joy, I will do them. These other things do not spark joy, and I want them to go away."" Eventually I cleanly fit into a label, but I didn't have that clarity until I started living the parts I knew. My identity keeps getting clearer over time as I'm on HRT and presenting female, and I'm finally starting to have a picture of the future in my head that I'm actually looking forward to.
Thank you so much. This, and all the other comments, really means a lot to me.
Absolutely agree. My 3 year old nephew loves Disney/cartoons and make believe. Sometimes he changes his name to Olaf or Mario and insists everyone call him this, other times he has been Anna, Elsa, Raya and insists on those names. We let him be whatever name is flavor of the day.
That's the catch, though. At the time, I was a little over 1 year old, so I don't remember it at all. 

As for my feelings, I've started feeling 'different' when I was around 12. I think you see my problem now.
Gender euphoria really is like putting on glasses for the first time. Like ""holy shit normal people just... feel comfortable sometimes? In their own bodies?""
>But there is also the possibility that your psychologist is just not educated enough on trans stuff, and that they didn’t realize how harmful that comment could be. Maybe they didn’t know that you’re born trans, and tried to give it an explanation, but still totally support you as trans. In the sense that they were not trying to actually deny your trans identity

Sure, this is the more charitable take. But even if this is what’s going on (which is a pretty big if) the therapist has shown that they are not qualified to help OP. Look at how much her saying this fucked with the poor dude. He went from happy and confident to feeling invalidated because an authority figure told him is entire identity is, essentially, made up. That’s wildly, immorally irresponsible even if it was true, and she’s also very obviously shooting from the hip with pseudoscientific bullcrap.

It’s easy to make trans people doubt themselves - in the world we grew up in, we’re constantly erased, disrespected, questioned, gatekept and belittled.

The bottom line is that this person should not be a therapist, period. They are not qualified. OP, please don’t let this clown plant doubts in your mind. You are valid. ❤️
It's bad therapy because there's no evidence for such a thing. The whole ""looking for attention"" is transphobic propaganda. How many trans people have *actually* just been looking for attention and not really been trans?
If you wanna add it to your autocorrect, the spelling is ""dysphoria."" It's the opposite of euphoria, which should be a word most autocorrects will get right.
Please do not restrict enbies to “in the middle” or “in between” the genders accepted by the binary gender system. Yes, some non-binary peoples identities do fall into that space but there’s so much more than simply being the purple to men and women’s pink and blue. We are all the colours on the colour spectrum apart from pink and blue, from purple to green to yellow to periwinkle to ultraviolet and infrared. 

I would like to know where you think that quack was coming from when you say their words shouldn’t be discredited. How does it work for a one year old to go through something that made them want to change their gender for attention eleven years later? If you’ve been having to put up with a therapist who pulls shit like this on you and you’re just gaslighted, please know that you deserve better than a therapist talking to you like this.
This OP. It sucks to start again but I think you should browse for a new therapist and report this one for invalidating you. Im in college and gender identity is no longer a question of your “beliefs” or “politics” or “religion” . Gender  identity is becoming a part of human biology and development classes, inclusivity studies are mandatory if you want your papers in my country as a clinical psychologist. Sounds like this therapist needs to update their education.
Yeah sometimes they forget that its an individual and the book doesnt always apply 100%
I had one therapist who tried to make conclusions from just a fraction of informations and i knew that i had to change the therapist cuz their opinions and theories just didnt fit me at all and I knew they didnt even hear the full “story” of me (this wasnt gender related but still similar situation)
Exactly how it feels to me too, well said
So she says you were envious without any proof or indication thereof?
Come on, you were 1 year. You probably didn‘t even compute what happened to you, let alone have the logical capacity to conclude „Oh it‘s because of my brother!“.  

Seems a little farfetched imho.
Lol, my euphoria ranges from a shot of happiness whenever I get a haircut or addressed as my gender to a unicorn blasting rainbows out of its ass at mach 10 to fly over the moon, wagging its tail like a puppy.

I swear I'm an adult- but sometimes wearing clothes I like brings out my inner labrador, lol.
The ""looking for attention"" idea is also inherently backwards. Do those people really think ANY of us enjoy the immense and horrible backlash we get for being trans? Is that enjoyable and worth seeking if it's not necessary? If I am looking for attention, I tell jokes or climb on a table and dance. I don't put a bullseye on my back so people can trample me.

The idea also thoroughly erases the existence of stealth trans people. How would we get attention from being trans if we're stealth? It makes no fucking sense.

All we want is to be happy as our authentic selves. Fuck this tyranny.

One year olds surely do not even have a concept of gender, let alone what a brother is or jealousy.
OP said they were a happy trans man until a quack said something stupid, you think that’s questioning? Since you’re defending the stupid that was said by the therapist then explain the mechanics of how what happened to him at a year old made him want to change gender for attention eleven years later. If it “resonates” so well with you that you think that it even needs consideration then please explain why everyone with a sibling doesn’t become trans to their sibling’s assigned gender? 

It’s not about resonating or not resonating. It’s about a therapist saying something incredibly stupid and abusive.

Past me would probably ask the same exact questions in the same order: Happy? Pass? Money? Ugh lol. 

I’m playing AC rn too!
Aaww this is so cute.

Reminds me of how, a few days ago, I went to read my post when I started questioning 2 years ago. I wish I could hug past me, and just say something like ""don't worry, you are a woman and it's totally fine (and 2 years from now you have boobs!)"" She (me) was so confused back then
This made me cry also. I hope you are in a better place now OP. Sending lots of support.
This is why I love trans people so much. Y’all are just so pure and genuine. Like sorry to generalize but every trans person I’ve met has been the nicest most down to earth type.
Sorry but what type of animal crossing is that?         Awww that’s so sweet for past you,  and I hope (if you haven’t already) you get enough money for that and everything will go ok!! 🤍
This is awesome
I deleted my original island because there is no option in the game to change one’s name and because I played a lot with my siblings I used my deadname.

I miss my fully decorated goth island :(

I still play the game from time to time though.
Really cute mail :) I have to try that!
I think I'd give her a hug and say everything is going to be okay things take time so go at your own pace. 


I remember my mindset while writing this back then, was the worst year of my life
yeahhhh the 3 main struggles we all seem to be facing lol and ikr, I legit forgot about this letter until now

Ohhhh, do you play regularly? I've hardly played since the pandemic tbh even though I bought the happy home dlc ((YET to even play that part))

legit you should send your future self a message it might cheer yourself up in the future
Same😭😭😭
aw thank you so much 💕 I am now, still have my bad days but overall starting to like life more and more lol
You know, this makes it even cooler to me! It's almost feels like the past you was aware of their mindset, and may have been trying to change it. 

And now they have given you the chance to compare how you felt then versus now. 
Seems like an awfully thoughtful gift from your past self! 😁
I actually didn’t know you could pick delivery dates haha. I want to try it. I’ve only played solo so not sure if I’ve even had the opportunity to send mail 😂 Guess I didn’t even know you could mail yourself

I used to be a regular! Just deleted my original island and started fresh! Kind of daunting. 

We bought a second Switch a year or two ago and I inherited a physical copy of AC and started my own island. I played for 8ish months and had a pretty sweet setup going and my island was great. So great that all I really had left to do was the daily stuff to earn money and… got bored I guess. 

Everything on my island was designed with efficiency in mind: rocks here, trees there, flowers up there, neighborhood here, etc. I had separate fields for breeding rare flower colors and an extensive tree/veggie farm. Only like 7-8 non-fruit trees for wasps and daily item drops. 

Hoping to be a little less rigid this time lol.
You are most welcome and I’m glad you are in a better place. 💖 I can definitely understand having bad days but I’m glad to hear that you are enjoying life more! 😊
yeahhhh I know! I can't wait to see what I said last year 😭😭 gotta keep up with the tradition now lol
You can send mail to yourself and your animal villagers at the postcard rack in the airport!"	11ucezq	trans	1071	0.99	2023-03-18 02:51:47

Oh no! You uncovered my secret identity!
Trans women face many of the same issues as cis women. Plus, as a bonus we get plenty of shit just for being trans too; you need look no further than this very thread to see some example of that."	s39fqn	trans	1066	0.99	2022-01-13 20:55:40
29, mtf, almost 11 months hrt. I'm so happy with myself. I've spent the entire transition panicking that I'm gonna look stupid, that I'll never get the changes I'm looking for. I worried for nothing. And I'm no where near done.		"Omgggg

I’ve been feeling worried and I needed to see a girl my age look so good so fast🥺
1. You’re very cute!

2. The Mega Man helmet behind you makes you a total package! 😆
Frick yes, you look great! And you've given me the encouragement I needed today (30 mtf stressing quite the same)
I’m 28 and 11 months in. Seeing other girls around my age is always the best feeling. 

Looking HAWT, my friend! 💕💕
I'm 24 and starting to get worried that my time to transition was about to be too late. But since you're a few years older than me and, not gonna lie, you are really beautiful. It's given me some confidence, so thank you.   


also I like your piercings
You worried for nothing indeed! 10/10, absolutely beautiful! As a 30 MtF who is only beginning her journey I hope I come out looking 1/2 as good!
I'm 25 and was kinda worried I was on the old side, seeing this gives me a lot of confidence/hope. 
You look great! Thanks for putting this out there.
You look awesome
You are one good looking woman.  I doubt you could ever look stupid.
You are beautiful
You are super cute, also your tips are useful. I will do more yoga
Ahhh you look amazing. 💕💕
You look amazing kiss kiss 😘
You're absolutely gorgeous 😻
Your hair is so amazing
Keep being you because you are amazing
you look so much like my aunt it’s crazy, i thought you were her at first and was very confused lol, you look amazing !!
You go girl!
I’m so happy for you and I’m glad you’re gaining confidence, best wishes
Love your hair, you look awesome!

Looking great😀👍
You look absolutely beautiful. If I didn’t know that this was the trans Reddit, my first thought would be and is that you are a beautiful woman. Good luck and congrats on it so far.
You look absolutely amazing! I just started HRT and I'm excited to start feeling more and more comfortable and I'm feeling that, ""I'm afraid that I'm going to look stupid"" feeling all the time.
Those glasses are you! Love your piercings too
Only 11 months?! You look absolutely fantastic! Also gives me alot of hope, I’m 27.
Very pretty 😋
You do not look stupid at all. you are a very beautiful girl.
Keep your chin up. You look beautiful. Thank you for sharing your progress. Ah good things come with time.

I shouldn't mention it but I'd love to see you nude as well.
You are an absolutely beautiful young woman 😚💕💋
VERY beautiful!! 😍😍 Your smile and your confidence are such goals to me!! ❤❤
My gosh you're so cute! I'm hoping I look nearly as good as you do when I go on hrt ❤
You are sooooo beautiful 💋🔥💋
Beautiful
I understand for real. At the beginning I was obsessed with finding cute girls that started as late as I did. Gave me hope. 

Just take care of yourself, take your hormones seriously, get plenty to eat and plenty of cardio and femme workouts. Your changes will come with time, and you won't notice them until you aren't looking for them. <3 congrats hun.
Lol thanks hun!
I love Megaman so much. First game I ever played. <3
Just turned 28 and about to start in the coming week. That said, I still wish I had started a lot sooner, mostly so I could have started to actually like being me earlier. But, that ship sailed and at least I am starting now, right? (Also, damn covid slowed the process down by several months.)
Thanks sweety. <3 congrats on starting that journey! You're in for something truly wonderful.

There's lots of stuff you're gonna deal with mentally, so just be prepared. You're gonna get emotional. Like really emotional. Lol gonna do so much soul searching.
Starting a few months from turning 28, posts like yours give me so much hope. You're beautiful. Thank you for sharing!
Do you have any favourite workouts? I noticed the pic of your bum and I'd love any glute workouts you might have, because something is clearly working. (Bit of an insecurity for me that I've been trying to work on but eh results seem kinda iffy)
Good choice for a first game! Do you listen to the Protomen also?
exactly! you’ll always mourn the “best time to start” but the second best time to start is always right now! 

Congrats on getting that script! 
We’re all gonna be fine!
I don't. 😮 a rock band?
Oh yeah! They’ve weaved an interesting story based off the Mega Man games. Admittedly their music isn’t for everyone but it’s also the type that grows on you. Totally recommend checking them out. If you do, I’d love to hear what you think.
I will! I love music, so it would be cool to find something new!"	je09ne	trans	1053	1.0	2020-10-19 11:58:20

3rd day on HRT! Sooooo happy to finally be living my authentic self and moving towards being more comfortable in my own skin!		"Yo! I started 3 days ago as well! Congrats on your progress and never lose sight of working towards your best self!
Hi what are HRTs?
Congratulations and good luck!
Omg for a sec I thought those were big poppers Jesus I gotta get out of the city
I'm so happy for you!
Awesomesauce!  I'm thrilled every time I see a trans person getting their HRT to start.  Cheers on your journey!
Congrats love!!!!!
Day 14 here! Welcome to the party we have chips and salsa and the pizza is on the way.

Edit: went through Folx too, shocked how easy that was
Yaaay !!!! Enjoy your Pride honey !
Folx? Are you liking the service and getting started? I know that's not easy to answer on day 3 but I've seen ads and I'm curious.
I clicked on this because I thought it was a “roast me”
You look great!!
congratulations beautiful, it is a beginning and it is one of the most important, feeling comfortable improves our mood and our life...🌹
i legit cannot tell your gender. you get the **ultimate andro award**
Hey! Congrats! How you feeling so far? 

Happy to have a HRT day twin ☺️
Third day for me too! Have you felt anything yet? I expect drastic changes in at the most a week.
Hormone Replacement Therapy

Essentially a trans girl would take medicine to block her Testosterone and give her Estrogen, and a trans guy would take medicine to block his Estrogen and give him Testosterone
I have a friend that works there and it sounds like good stuff. I have really good insurance so I haven't needed to use Folx but I totally would
It’s been surprising easy and very helpful and informative. I have an hour long session with a clinician before they put me on HRT, they were super helpful in answering questions I had and making sure I was in a good headspace. 

I think they are relatively cheap as well. So far so good!
Roast away!
Nothing so far. I am using the patches and am surprised at how well they stick.
Eh, nothing crazy for me either. I do notice that I’m more hungry than usual. Haven’t had any drastic mood swings that are unusual. 

People have told me that it has calmed me down a bit? I guess I don’t realize that 🤣
Thank you!
Do you know the comparisons on prices? I'm trying to start hrt without my parents help and all I have is a part time job :( Going to college too so I'm gonna be tight on funds.
I was very curious about that, what hurdles they put in the way considering how expensive mental health care is in the US. It's good to know they arent monsters.
I'm on E, Spiro ...and progesterone at night. I'm less hungery, but food tastes better.. I'm also more relaxed and calm. I have ADHD and it calmed it down a lot
On Folx- Im on Estradiol pills and Spironolactone, Its currently costing me $139/m. It goes down after 1 year on hrt."	o7qfza	trans	1025	0.98	2021-06-25 15:52:42
happy trans visibility day! i finally feel comfortable enough wearing my binder than i can rock a mesh top, love you all ❤️		"bro that is a sick mask where did you get it
LOVE the mask. I made a few things similar with spikes, studs, safety pins and piercing jewelry!
m e s h s h i r t
Dude your hair looks fucking sick, nice mask too.
realistic transition goals? nah i want this
Outfit is cool, attitude is cooler, and I think that’s hilariously appropriate for you to wear a partially-see-through top for a “visibility” day - love it!

sincere question: why is Trans Visibility Day on April 1st (same as April fools)?
i love the fit!
Whoa i love that outfit. So cool!
You look great (:
This is the best outfit I've ever seen. I really dig your style
i made it! an old purse and a few necklaces had to die for it,, but it think it was worth it

I hate cute bitches who havent even gone on hormones yet, yall give me the biggest gender envy, you're so pretty ;-;
What- 
You look super feminine you don’t even Need it😭
You look super feminine girl
You look like someone but  I can't point my finger on who it is
Good luck on your journey! When I began, I was super excited but after a while, the journey can feel dull cus it feels like as if it takes forever but time does fly. You will reach your goal, trust me!
Yeah! Welcome to the sisterhood!
I looooove your shirt! You look amazing.
I am thrilled for you <3
Beautiful 😍😍🥰😍😍🥰🥰💞💞💕💕💞💞🥰
Congrats!!!! So happy and proud for you!
❤️
You have a right to be happy. You will now feel how you look. Which is freaking gorgeous. I want you to mark the day you start on your HRT regime as your birth day. 

I celebrate mine every year. 

And please enjoy each new feeling as the estrogen starts to erase your male body. Even if you feel really sad and feel like crying all the time (DO IT when you can!) and how proud you're going to be of your new breasts and how your body seems to magically reshape itself. 

Your breasts will ache a lot, and will be painful to touch, but you will be astounded at how you (and they) look by the end of the year. Exciting!!!

You are already a beautiful young woman; HRT will just affirm your female soul. And like I said, enjoy every second of your journey--even if you ache all over. 

Which you will.

But it'll also feel wonderful...
Congratulations and welcome, pretty girl! You look incredible! 🎉🥳💝💋🎉🥳💝💋🏆💃🏻
Rocking that collar
I think you look amazing
absolutely love your choker, earrings, makeup, smile, hair, and everything else about you

Also congrats on starting HRT!!
Oml that collar or belt? Looks awesome. Cant imagine the amount of thirsty peeps coming to your dms. But anyway. Congrats :3
Congrats
Looking good allrady, also... did u do the beard removal thing (i wanna do it but dont know how)
so beautiful, where did you get the collar/choker?
Nice
Oh my congrats love!!! And you look amazing like wow
U r so sweet and pretty
You haven't started HRT and you already pass 😗
thank you!!
I feel this, it sorta crushes my will but hey one step at a time we go sister. 💙
Yeah, I was like she looks good now, so things are going to look even better probably. And then I thought oh wait a minute maybe she’s actually a man lol OK I guess not, in which case HRT is definitely probably going to help even more!
Maybe Morena Baccarin? That the vibe I'm getting here."	py2e3j	trans	1028	0.99	2021-09-29 19:11:29
Didn't expect this interaction	"I was talking to this guy, told him my pronouns, he messed up a lot, but he corrected himself, and I told him I appreciate that he corrected himself. Then he tells me ""well, piss me off and I won't do that"". Maybe he doesn't understand that that's a threat, but it made me feel... uncomfortable. I know this is the first of many bad experiences to come. I'm just happy that this happened in a voice chat and not in person."	"Respect for who someone is should be the default and not some fucking reward for “behaving”.  That kind of behavior is extremely worrying and gross.
Big red flag
He might not have meant it as an actual threat but it does show that he does not respect your identity at all and he thinks you should 'earn' being treated with basic human respect so it's a major red flag even if it was not on purpose at all...
Uh whoever that is, I'd avoid them. I don't know what your interaction is based off of, but that isn't someone you should continue to talk to.
Interesting that he thinks your pronouns are optional and he can use them as a favor to you... Incorrect assumption on his part. Your pronouns are not optional! I'm sorry he treated you this way, please don't tolerate it from him or anyone!!
That’s definitely a bit sus
Yeah that’s weird, even ignoring the whole threat aspect of it, its still weird. Like i dont call my friends racial slurs solely because they haven’t pissed me off yet. I dont say those things because they are hurtful. 

Misgendering someone on purpose is pretty shitty thing to do and it seems like they know exactly how shitty the behavior is and are willing to do it under certain circumstances.
Ew. :-/
Nope nope nope. Run. Not the kind of thing a friend should tell you. People don’t get to be bigots conditionally. Can you imagine if that was about something else? 

“Hey so I’m deaf, I can’t hear”


“Well piss me off and I’m NOT using sign language for you. You don’t deserve respect unless I’M happy” 

It’s stupid asinine immature thinking, that person is trying to establish a sense of power over you. Don’t let them.
Major red flag
“Behave and I’ll treat you with common decency.” Run
It’s giving conditional allyship vibes. That’s a massive red flag.
yikes yikes yikes. having your identity and pronouns respected should never be conditional, it should never be something you have to earn or something that can be taken away from you because you did something “wrong”
Block him asap
And I'll bet its fucking easy to piss him off if he's already deciding his punishment. There are a lot of cis people waiting with baited breath to punish trans people more severely for smaller slights than everyone else. They're uncomfortable with us and they'd never admit their transphobia so they think they're simply following a natural instinct that we're somehow untrustworthy in a way other people don't see so when we do literally anything that reflects negatively because we're human they were right all along and they have permission to be transphobic.

Its like liberal guys who cant talk about class disparity without evoking the Kardashians and calling them bimbos or can't critique a republican politican without insulting their weight.
BLOCK HIM NOW
Lmao you should've been like ""alright, seems fair for me to do the same"" and see how he reacts to that idea. People can be so ignorant. I'd have kicked that fucker from the vc ;p
ew? lmfao
For your safety, stay the fuck away from that guy. That’s absolutely trash.
Avoid and block the same you would a 2 year old account with 1 karma following you.
Yeah, ew.  That sounds suspiciously like the last time I would talk to them.
i was like “oh that’s grea- oh no…”
ok ok i used to be closeted asf but when i said that shit it was more like trying to bring humor because I was the uncomfortable one (being closeted af / straight af etc)
Instant ghost 👻
I was told by someone who was my friend and I didn’t know they hated their first name and went by a middle name until two years after I met them, that if I called them their first name (even on accident) they would purposely deadname me so I “know how it feels”…

So I felt that
red flag.
If people say they support trans folks, but then threaten to misgender you at the slightest inconvenience, they /do not/ support trans folks. So sorry this happened to you
Without additional context this very much sounds, to me, like a guy who was trying to be an ally and tried to use humor to deflect from the awkwardness some get when complimented by a stranger.
Is it bad that I would laugh because I would read that as him making a joke about how some people respect pronouns of trans people as long as we remain complacent and docile to their opinions.
Anyone that does that, it very obviously means that they hella don’t see you as you truly are. People should use people’s pronouns because *they’re their pronouns*, not because they’re just “playing along because they like you” or whatever bs
I hate that when I experience transphobia, one of my first thoughts (of many racing thoughts and feelings) is that I need to get used to this.

I shouldn't have to get used to it :'/
Perhaps he just didn't mean it to come out like that, but it did, and he didn't know what to say after.
Probably not how he really feels. Maybe he regrets saying it.
He probably didn't mean to make you uncomfortable, or for the impression his comment gave.
Most people, when speaking in a conversation, do not have the time to think through the connotations of everything they say. And sometimes thing just come out that sound off.
That's life 🤷🏼‍♀️
Sounds like he doesn't know how to take a compliment.
This is the same with people who refuse to use preferred pronouns for shitty people or criminals. They view pronouns as a right, and not as a something that should be normalized. I hate it so much because they wouldnt do this with cis pronouns.
Whoever that guy is I’d avoid him.  Very very clear he does not respect you at all
And where is the point where they deem revoking our preferred pronouns? Tax evasion? Possession of marijuana?
I think you mean “privilege” instead of “right”.
I'm not a fan of Caitlin Jenner, for instance but I'll still use her correct pronouns.
ezra miller and chris chan were big examples that I noticed. I even saw ""leftists"" saying that those two ""dont deserve"" to be called by their preferred pronouns. yeah, both of them are shitty people, but if we allow pronouns to be treated like that then they're never gonna be normalized
yes! Im a dummy lol
Exactly! I use her and Blair White as examples of this many times
> wouldn’t do this with cis pronouns

I remember some people would actually do this years ago before we became the boogeyman of the “culture war”. I explicitly remember Alex Jones calling Glenn Beck a woman and using “she/her” for him, just to demean him, but they wouldn’t do that today because they need to own “Big Trans^TM “

Am I invalidating anyone's identity if I believe lesbians can't like trans men?	"I'm ftm and I've personally never been comfortable being pursued by any lesbians/straight guys. However, I've noticed a decently large amount of transfems identifying as lesbians while dating trans guys on trans subreddits like this and i wanted to know if and how that would be possible?

My gf is trans too *(used to identify as a transbian)* and insists she couldn't love me if she wasn't bi, but I notice a few people say that they have 'exceptions' or that trans guys fall under their lesbian sexuality?

I personally found that idea very insensitive and invalidating. Would a transbian date a cis man? Would those trans girls be willing to date an mlm guy or a straight girl? Would that not be invalidating their female identity? Could an mlm trans guy be dating a trans lesbian? I'm curious because I've never seen it go the other way around and it feels like this stems more from the lack of transmasc representation and the common view of trans men as butch lesbians rather than 'real men'. To me it feels transphobic, as though transmascs are held as a less important identity and can be regarded as female rather than admitting to attraction towards men *(even if it's exclusively trans men)*.  If someone identifying as a lesbian dates a trans man, why would they not want to change their label to something that is inclusive of masculine identities in order to validate their partner?

I really hope I didn't come off as rude or invalidating, I tried my best not to. I'm really curious to hear any differing opinions, does it apply the same or differently for trans women, if so why?

EDIT: Wanted to thank you all for the amount of responses I got, I was not expecting to hear so many people's opinions but I'm glad I did :) I also wanted to apologize to anyone who recieved any harassment in the comments, that was not my intention but I am sorry regardless.

I wanted to clarify a few things: I absolutely agree that lesbians can date enby and masc people, this was referring to (mostly/fully) binary trans men like myself, many of who find it transphobic to be grouped in non-male orientations. I am also NOT going out and telling people what labels they must use so please do not do that to people here!

That being said, I've noticed a lot of people disregarding the bisexuality of people who prefer one gender and invalidating trans men's discomfort and input in this discussion which I find upsetting. My opinion remains largely unchanged, but thank you for taking the time to engage.

Bonus EDIT: For those of you giving me advice for my relationship, sorry for the confusing wording. My gf and I are both bi and happy with our identities, this was not supposed to be about us."	"trans men are men so you are completely right
as a transfem myself, i have thought abt this recently. i do worry abt you transmascs because this is typically how society treats you guys under the LGBTQ+ umbrella and it's totally unfair. my amab bf is straight, because he does his best to look at me as a girl (context, he has admitted that i don't have to get the surgery or even transition because his attraction is far beyond skin deep, so ik he's not taking advantage of me but at the end of the day he doesn't like it up the bum). a partner should do their best to validate their partner. maybe if said transmasc person willingly keeps some of their feminine traits / styles (like maybe if they were a trans femboy, i've seen this before) then you could argue that they have an attraction to anyone with feminine qualities (because that is a thing), but you say this in a way that makes me assume that this isn't the case. i hope people start giving you the validation you deserve brother. i don't think your partner means harm if they are transbian, but try to bring this up to her. communication is key!

edit: i've never met someone who supported me as much as my bf. the first vc he hopped in with me after hearing that i'm trans, he was calling me May and using she/her/hers pronouns. he also got more comfortable with coming out abt his feelings, and trust me the feelings are mutual. we've been friends for 4 or so years, since my junior year of hs. we made the whole school think we were gay but we both apparently actually had feelings the whole time. issue with him is that he hates pp and so he only became comfortable with telling me when i made it clear i'm not keeping mine. he's typically an edgy troll so i was always scared he wouldn't accept me, so when he did respect by name and pronouns i should've known lol. wish he had told me when we were still neighbors.. wish i'd come out way sooner
Nope that is perfectly fair especially if it's a situation of you feel invalidated
Well trans men are men, if a woman is in a relationship with a man that's a straight relationship
I am fully with you generally. Lesbians and trans men historically had a lot more overlap than they do now so folks make cases for inclusion...But I (MTF) for instance dated an amab nb person who would *not* stop calling themselves ""gay"", even after I talked to them about it. It ended up being one of of the primary reasons I dumped them. 


So I get how you feel and have personally felt the same. You're a man.
How I see it, someone can identify with a particular label for their sexuality, and can date someone outside of what that label would imply, but in that case shouldn't use the label to refer to the relationship. 

i.e. someone could identify as a lesbian and date someone outside their typical preference (a man,) so could still identify with the label but shouldn't use it to describe the relationship they're currently in.
It's more invalidating to consider yourself lesbian whilst dating a trans masc imo
The literal way of seeing it is that transbians like women and transmascs are men
Trans men are men, so a girl, cis or trans, being with a trans guy, isn’t in a lesbian relationship. Thouuuuugh… some girls really want to make clear they’re not into cis men, for some reasons. There isn’t any term saying «I’m excluding cis men from my sexuality but I’m cool with everyone else». Sometimes it’s just easier to keep the lesbian term, even if sometimes it’s not really defining ourselves
So yeah, this happened to me. I'm mtf and I thought I was a lesbian. Then this guy comes into my life, I don't know why, but the first time I saw him I nearly fell to the floor. He is trans (ftm), I didn't know it at the time, I thought he was a cis guy. Well anyways, I've been conflicted with the lesbian label ever since, and then stuff started happening between us. So yeah, I'm definitely not a lesbian, at least not right now. The thing is, I've never liked a guy before, he is literally the only one. 

I'm of the opinion that sexuality fluctuates, so for example, I was a lesbian, I couldn't ever be attracted to men, then he appeared, now I'm bi, in the future, I might be still bi, go back to lesbian, or turn straight (please god no). Anyways, what I'm saying is, this are all just labels we use to try and define ourselves, and yes, dating a guy still identifying as a lesbian is invalidating, don't do it.
It certainly feels a bit peculiar to me, but there are some transmasculine people who are comfortable being associated with the phrase lesbian. Heck, technically *I'm* not a lesbian and *technically* my relationship isn't one but we use those terms for each other sometimes. 

If people are invalidating their partners' identities then yeah that's definitely an unhealthy relationship but if that's a term that they feel comfortable with and feels associated with their relationship, I'm not so bothered by it. To each their own, sexuality and gender are complicated and as a nonbinary person i completely get why someone would still feel politically aligned with a gender they don't technically belong to.
What I've heard from trans history actually FtMs are not usually an issue for lesbians and part of that is probably they are not recognize them as real men as a cis guys. But MtFs are topic for them, usually rejected all the way by lesbians . There were a lot of issues in the past and for that reason there was created festival Camp Trans. The acceptance even in LGBTQIA+ community is an issue and usually acceptance of MtFs.
I’m right there with you. I genuinely believe a lot of the “I’m gay lesbian but….” mind sets stem from compulsive heterosexuality. It’s something that’s bright up a lot in lesbian subs but rarely mentioned in trans subs.

I used to say I was 99% attracted to women. Then I started reading up on comphet and realized it described almost exactly what I was doing and thinking.

I do feel saying something like “I’m a lesbian who’s also attracted to men” is disingenuous and invalidating. This is a pretty common feeling in cis lesbian circles. Many of them say “well I’m not attracted to men at all and am a lesbian. So these two definitions of lesbian cannot co-exist because they are contradictory.”

It’s also going against the core mantra the trans community says over and over. Trans men are men, trans women are women.  If a was dating a woman that kept insisting she was straight, I would feel incredibly invalidated. Because fact is, she would be in a lesbian relationship.

I’ve had women interested in me that clearly didn’t think of me as a woman, but as a very feminine and pretty man. Like “no girl, you can’t call me ‘daddy’ would you ask a cis woman that?” Yes I’ve actually had that happen to me.

Anyways point is I feel sexuality is broad and nuanced, and we have plenty of accurate terms to where we don’t need to co-opt more widely known labels because they are more generally accepted by the hetero population.
if someone is a lesbian and says that includes trans men they clearly dont see trans men as actual men. obviously gender and sexuality can be complicated and is often more fluid than some people like to think of it as, but yeah thats just transphobic
by definition lesbians are not into men. you are a man. by trying to date you a lesbian is trying to say that she doesn't see you as a man, which. fuck that
No.

Trans men are men. Lesbians are not attracted to men.

It is both transphobic and lesbophobic to claim that lesbian identity had to include trans guys.
I'm a transbian in a relationship with a cis guy.  I'm about a 5 on the kinsey scale but I don't control whom I love

I get where you're coming from and those feelings are valid but love isn't a logical process that follows our sentiments like *I'm not supossed to love this person*
trans men are men so lesbians dating us just invalidates every trans masc to ever walk the planet.
I, a gay trans man, am in a 12 yr relationship with someone who was a lesbian for the vast majority of it. They tried to be straight for like six months. It was terrible. So, we were just a married gay and lesbian. That’s who we were. 

 The problem I think is that ppl reduce sexuality to just ‘who I fuck’ and it’s a lot more nuanced than that. My partner had 20 years of lesbian activism, culture, life behind them when we got together. Had I insisted that they id as straight or even bi *I* would be asking them to erase all that history. And that’s pretty messed up. It was half their life. So this conversation veers very close to asking ppl to deny important parts of themselves. 

Lastly, who my partner is doesn’t invalidate me in any way. Their labels don’t have anything to do with *me*. 

ETA:I’m a person in my own right. Also some spelling and formatting
You would be invalidating the identities of trans men if you thought that lesbians could.
I have a horrible suspicion some people here saying you’re forcing others to use labels don’t see trans men as men. I also feel like you’d never hear this same question asked the other way around, it’s both transphobic and lesbophobic to say lesbians can like trans men
Honestly i think youre right. Im a nonbinary transmasc and i welcome lesbians being attracted to me, but binary trans men are men. Attraction at its base might go for expression so i see how some lesbians may be *attracted* to some trans men, but once they know theyre men then they shouldnt pursue that attraction without acknowledging that theyre attracted to a man. Plus, masculine lesbians exist so its not like every lesbian has to be attracted to feminine presentation exclusively.

That said, attraction can also be very fluid and restricting people to labels can just cause distress all around when an exception is found. But if a trans man is not comfortable dating a lesbian who sees him as their exception, then just.. dont date that lesbian and let them know exactly why. You cant stop people from being attracted to you but you can let them know that nothing can come of it if they dont acknowledge your gender.
Of course not. If a lesbian likes a trans man, that's invalidating his identity as a man.
People can identify strongest with one label, but still find people attractive, or another reason they want to be together with that person, that fall outside of their orientation. If that wasn't possible, ace and aro people couldn't date anyone. Labels are more of a guideline instead of hard rules.
you are not lesbian if you like trans men, no
But a lesbian is a woman who likes women, so she can't like a guy? Trans men are men so therefore a lesbian can't like them
Yeah we’re men so it is invalidating to our existence as trans guys ❤️
as a straight female, im attracted to trans men and also cis men, and in terms of how manly they are to me it feels the same
IMO the person comes before the label. Labels should be subservient to the people that use them, not the other way around.
I don't consider you rude or invalidating. 

To me, a transfemme lesbian; anybody can date anybody they like and want to spend time with.  We may have *personal preferences* \- but ultimately, a *person*... is who we are attracted to.
I think this is an interesting question. I am in the camp of saying sexuality is a spectrum and different for everyone. Some folks have different romantic and sexual orientations too so they may use labels that reflect who they would be in a relationship with long-term versus who they might hook up with. Labels and language are supposed to help us create connections but they aren't always clean around the edges. 

As an example, I'm transmasc, but my partner has always used the world lesbian as a label before me. When we got together, my partner asked if it bothered me and I kind of shrugged and said ""so you are a lesbian with an exception."" I know she doesn't see me as a woman so it doesn't bother me. 

Now, if I were casually dating, it might feel invalidating, especially since it's hard to judge sometimes if people really do see me for ME or if they are just good about being respectful of language. 

All of that said, I guess my vague response for myself is ""it depends"" lol
I think many women who’ve been only ever attracted to one man—cis or trans—and had everyone else they’ve been attracted to be women would consider themselves lesbians still. Labels are imperfect.
In theory yes it’s easy to cast judgement and say it’s transphobic for lesbians and trans men to date but I think real life and relationships have a bit more nuance than that. If lesbians are intentionally seeking out trans men as part of their dating pool that’s gross imma just throw that out there. However there are instances when two people are in an established relationship and one comes out as trans and both partners are willing to accept the other’s identity and still love each other because they don’t see their love or relationship as being about gender. This doesn’t work for everyone and it’s okay to break up if your sexualities are no longer compatible, but each couple is different.
I'm an out and proud transbian and around a year ago I was dating a closeted trans guy. During the course of our relationship he came out and we both had an identity crisis because of it. I still really cared for him as a partner despite identifying as a lesbian, and he was questioning whether coming out and transitioning was the right thing to do (for my identity's sake) 

In the end I gave up on putting a label on how I felt about him and just enjoyed the time we had together as a straight couple. We did eventually drift apart and break up and are even better friends than we were partners, turns out he's gay too.

My advice is to not worry about labels and just enjoy the relationship that you do have. Love is beautiful and she's still with you because of who you are as a person, not who you are as an identity xx
My gf and I are both genderfluid lesbians. I'm transfem and they're transmasc and neither of us feel invalidated because neither of us are men. In your case though, it is absolutely invalidating for someone to call themself a lesbian and also be attracted to binary trans guys. If a lesbian is attracted to nonbinary transmasc people I wouldn't say that's universally invalidating but some people may still be uncomfortable with it if they're nonbinary but also identify as a man or are very heavily masc aligned. For example, my ex was a trans guy and he called himself gay even though I was still nonbinary and transfem at the time and I kept rationalizing it to myself by saying ""it's technically okay because I'm not a binary woman so he can still be attracted to me"" when in reality I felt really uncomfortable and invalidated because my identity was still very fem aligned and I felt like he saw me as a guy
People identify their sexuality by what they're primarily attracted to. But sexuality isn't a rule or a box that you have to fit yourself into, it's a manmade concept to help us understand each other. Just because someone who indentifies as lesbian likes a trans-man doesn't mean they are no longer lesbian. But I guess you could say if a woman was to date a trans man it wouldn't be a lesbian relationship but a hetero relationship.
I think people’s sexual orientation is their own business. None of the terminology is perfect — especially in a world where people are becoming more open and less closeted about their transitions and where it is more acceptable that sexuality is fluid. 

If a woman identifies as a lesbian, but falls for a trans guy, she shouldn’t have to change the label with which she has identified her whole life. She probably finds some aspects of that trans guy attractive because she is *also* attracted to women. It might be based on the shared history of having been raised with similar experiences (Girl Scouts, etc) or it might have to do with what she prefers in bed….If that bothers you, then that is totally understandable and you shouldn’t  date that woman. But there are other trans guys who it won’t bother and it doesn’t mean those guys aren’t trans guys or that that woman doesn’t *really* love them.

Totally different situation, but just to illustrate how complicated these terms can be….My trans-feminine non-binary partner has identified as heterosexual (meaning attracted to women and female presenting individuals) their whole life. Now they are taking hormones and transitioning — and are still only attracted to women. So do they call themselves a lesbian? Even though they don’t fully identify as a woman?  Calling themselves lesbian or homosexual doesn’t really fit with the part of themself that still identifies as a man. But what other (commonly-understood) word is there that represents a person who isn’t interested in men, but also is not themself either a woman nor a man?  Shrugging and saying “I’m straight” might not be all that accurate, but it is what my partner is most familiar with, so they are sticking with it for now. A lesbian who is sometimes attracted to trans guys might find that the familiarity of the label and the identity with the community might outweigh the relative inaccuracy of the descriptor. Especially since identifying as a bisexual means getting a LOT of unwanted attention from cis men.
As a lesbian, I say that you are right and ""lesbians"" that ""like"" trans men are just transphobic chasers.
Well, I am a straight girl, and dating a trans man won't change anything; it will still be a straight relationship, nothing else.
Not really no? Trans men are men and people who identify as lesbians are just attracted to women and those on the feminine spectrum.

Now if you're attracted to men/masc ppl and identify as lesbian for whatever reason then it's whatever.

But if you ONLY like women and those with femme aligned genders but decide to go after a trans man anyways you are transphobic. Major chaser energy.

I'm a transmasc demiboy, and I don't like the thought of dating lesbians or straight men. Not a preference, I just don't wanna date them cause I'm not a woman and my gender isn't femme in anyway. 

I am however a femboy, I like dressing up femme sometimes cause I like feeling pretty. 

My PRESENTATION is feminine, my GENDER is not.

So if a lesbian/straight guy knew this and still wanted to date me (without reconsidering their sexual/romantic orientation) that's transphobic cause they probably see me as a girl. 

Honestly it really depends on the person and their relationship with their partner. If they're both comfortable, then it doesn't matter. 

Lesbians who don't like men/masc ppl are valid, ppl who identify as lesbians but like men/masc ppl are valid.

Lesbians who don't like men/masc ppl at all but go after trans men/transmasc anyway are valid in their identity but they are gross and stinky and I don't like them.
I think its definitely very invalidating when attracted-to-women people are also attracted to trans guys. No doubt. At the same time, i personally (trans woman) identity as culturally lesbian, but sexually pan. I get if that would make trans guys or hell even cis guys uncomfortable but i dont know how else to describe the way i am. Idk.
My experience with dating a trans guy as a lesbian identifying trans women was difficult to say the least. He had amazing qualities but I really struggled with being attracted to him and ultimately that is why our relationship ended. Just want to point out that for the first 3ish months that I knew him I didn’t even know he was trans. He did finally come out to me at my surprise. I tried to explain to him that I was not attracted to men sexually and that definitely applied to him as I only ever saw him as a man regardless of what genitals he had. I couldn’t imagine myself dating another trans man or trans masc person because 1 I’m not in any way shape or form attracted to men or masculinity and 2 a person’s genitals or reproductive organs do not dictate their gender. So if someone claims to be a lesbian but dates outside of that then they are more than likely using the wrong identifiers or they do not see you as a man🤷‍♀️

This is definitely a conversation you should have with your partner especially if it makes you uncomfortable. Also yes many people in the community trans or not can be transphobic. It may not be intentional but it is still not okay behavior.

Edit: I just want to add that I did date him because he was incredibly nice and a very loving person to me and my children. I thought that it was something I could adapt to and I did really care about him but ultimately the two of us were trying to force something because of the fear of loneliness…..I really wish that we could have never crossed that line and just remained friends.
If someone identifying as a lesbian is dating someone who is a man in their gender (not necessarily using he/him pronouns, but seeing their gender as male), then it would be invalidating to continue identifying as a lesbian. 

As a trans man myself, I would be offended if my partner still identified as a lesbian. Because Homosexuality refers to someone liking someone of similar gender to themself. In the case of Lesbianism, that means anyone who doesn't identify as a man (so this can include nonbinary, agender, genderfluid, genderflux, etc. individuals). If someone uses He/Him pronouns, but does not identify with male as their gender, then these individuals are not men, and therefore still fall under the Lesbian label. 

I am not one of these individuals, and other trans men like me do not fall under these labels because we are **men**. 

People forget that being Bi and Pan doesn't mean you have to be exactly 50/50 on your attraction towards Male-identifying and Female-identifying individuals. You could be attracted 99 99% to women, or men, or Non-binary genders, and still have that 0.01% that likes that one specific person who's gender is different from those you're usually attracted/have a preference to. Still makes you Bi/Pan. 

To think a trans man is able to fall under a lesbian's sexuality label is very transphobic and makes me very upset. Trans Men are **Men**; just like Trans Women are Women. No if's, and's, or but's. If you don't respect that, then you need to get out of here. 😤😤😤

Know you haven't been offensive in your expression of things, OP. While there are nuances to things, there are a few things that are clean cut.

EDIT: After talking with individuals, I do have some amends to my original response to add. 

1) I think the most important thing to denote with some of these things is the intent of and the individuals involved. Some people are going to be okay with it, and that is perfectly fine. You don't have to change your labels if that is something that is what you are most comfortable with. That is something that is important to discuss with at the beginning of a relationship, or before getting into a relationship. 

2) There can be a very distinct difference between binary men, and those who are Non-binaried identifying men (such as those who are genderfluid, genderflux, bigender, etc.) Cause those individuals will have a different opinion about such things than those of us who are binary men, especially binary trans men. 

Those who are binary trans men, I feel a majority of us do not wish to date someone who identify as lesbian, as we ourselves see ourselves as not fallinf into the category of someone in that sexuality. 

Those who differ in labels otherwise are welcomed, so long as no malicious intent is involved c: I think we all just want people to feel safe and comfortable, especially with how much Transphobia and Bi/Pan/Omniphobia is out there, even within our own Queer Community.
I'm with you, though it's a complicated subject and things will differ with each perspective brought to the table.

I'm transfemme, she/they and definitely enjoy causing some gender confusion in others, but lean towards the feminine side of things. Would rather be viewed as a girl first and then share my non-binary with other queer folk who get it.

But I hate it when a cis gay or even bi guy is into me. Gay guy ends up focusing on my amab body parts, which I don't want and state and it usually still happens.... They just want my body, and for the wrong reasons, so pass. Or I get bi cis guys using the ""best of both worlds"" thing... and then I feel awful and like a fetish thing, not a lovable girl. It's frustrating, oh so frustrating. Very insensitive and invalidating for sure... For lack of better terms, they're attracted to your dead self, the parts of you that you are trying to reconfigure, let go and change... They're holding on to those qualities and I just don't think it will result in a healthy dynamic.
When I was earlier in my transition, I thought I was a lesbian. Absolutely no men for me, then my now boyfriend (ftm) kissed me and I realized I wasn’t all gay.
When I was figuring out my identity I identified as a lesbian for a short stint but mostly because I had some unresolved trauma towards cis-men. Trans-men didn’t apply to that, they were “safe” in my mind because we understand the “”female”” experience of toxic cis men. I realize now that I only identified as a lesbian so I wasn’t putting myself out there as a single fem-aligned person on the market for cis men. Now I just identify as bisexual, but I’m mostly t4t
Trans men are men, not ""women lite"", they are men. Lesbians are attracted to women, it by definition excludes men because that is the point. Lesbians cannot like men. Trying to claim otherwise is extremely lesphobic and comes of as conversion therapy rhetoric.

This whole argument is dumb as hell, no one does this shit to gay men, the world doesn't revolve around men. Women can exist without attraction to men. The fact people here are even attempting to claim otherwise is horrifying. 

Also trying to include trans men into lesbianism is insanely transphobic, trans men are real men, it would be no different than trying to say a straight man could be lesbian when that's not real and people pushing that belief are supporting corrective r*pe.
no you’re not invalidating anyone by saying that. if they like trans men they are not lesbians they are invalidating the men they’re interested in and prove they don’t see trans men as men. <3
Genital preference =/ gender preference. Basically, lesbians aren’t attracted to men. Trans men are men. 
Lesbian means non men loving non men. Enbies aren’t men, trans women aren’t men, cis women aren’t men, so all of these people can be lesbian. Same goes with gay/mlm, just for enbies and men.
Gender is a spectrum, why should sexuality not be one?
Personally I feel that labels for sexuality are just way to confining, for me I think I'm a lesbian but I can get turned on my man too. Just enjoy who you want to and pick a label that you can tell other people when they ask. At least that's what I do 😝 hope you find something that works for you guys
We make the labels for the people, not the people for the labels. 

This whole conversation feels _deeply_ confusing to me\*, because... like... they're words? ""Lesbian"", as a category, means different things to different people, to a frankly frightening degree. So does ""gay"". So does ""woman"" or ""man""! 

All of these are labels we give ourselves. They may correspond in some way to some fundamentally natural or biological _thing_, but at the end of the day, they're terms we use to describe ourselves, and if the term doesn't help us understand ourselves or help others understand who we are... The whole thing's a waste of time.

Personally, I've found that fighting over the boundaries, over where these labels start and end, is basically always a huge waste of time. They're words! They mean different things to different people, and the whole point is understanding each other. My partner has at times identified as a trans man, a butch lesbian, or both. You can say ""I don't really understand how a trans man can be a lesbian"", because that's a matter of semantics and understanding (and if he's in a good mood, he might explain how he thinks about it), but to say ""You can't be a lesbian, you're a trans man"" is to miss the point. ""Lesbian"" is not some platonic category. There is no High Council Of Elder Lesbians who are going to come down from on high and separate the self-identified lesbians into valid and invalid, as much as TERFs wish there was. It's all communication. If you're asking if it's ""possible"" for someone who identifies as male to also identify as a lesbian... Well, obviously! You started the thread because you noticed that there were people doing it! 😁

I hope any of this makes sense. If I had to summarize, I'd say the TL;DR is ""Yes, _but_ it's complicated and has to do with how you think about language"".

\* Why yes, I _am_ autistic, thank you for noticing
If you take the definitions strictly than yeah, but for me sexualities aren’t rock solid so a lesbian could have that one man they like and they could be trans. Now a lot of lesbians do this and invalidate trans men so obviously fuck that shit but sexuality is too complicated to give binary answers
I agree with you however, if a lesbian is dating closeted trans male and then, the trans male comes out to them, then the lesbian is not obligated to change their sexuallity even if they stay together.
In my opinion, the labels we use to identify sexual orientation are just descriptors, tools for who we are generally interested in. Sometimes there are exceptions to those labels and sometimes those exceptions are boundary pushers that expand someone's understanding of their sexuality. 

Just because someone is open to dating a particular trans person or because someone who is straight but their partner transitions doesn't mean they need to change the label they self prescribe or leave the relationship. It just means that the label they self prescribed doesn't fit that situation. 

A straight woman and a closeted trans woman start a relationship under the assumption the trans woman is a cis man, then the trans woman comes out and transitions. If the relationship continues to work, then that doesn't automatically make the cis woman bisexual or gay. She may not be open to initiating relationships with other women under normal circumstances, but in a particular situation the label simply just didn't work. That doesn't mean the label ""bisexual"" works either though.
trans men are men. Lesbians who like trans guys aren't lesbians!
If a lesbian likes trans guys, they’re bisexual. Trans men aren’t women so they shouldn’t be pursued as one. If she does, she sees you as a woman instead of a dude.
I agree with you 100%. Being lesbian means not being attracted to men, trans men are men, I would take offense to being sought after by a lesbian or being an “exception”.
At what point are we going to get over this need to have a word to define everything and just let love and passion rule?
Honestly, I am transfemme (mtf) and my girlfriend is straight while I identify as a lesbian. I think it mostly comes down to your preference for how you refer to yourself.
Trans men are men if she's into men she's not a lesbian
A bit. I like people that I'm not sexually attracted to. Ace folk date people too despite their not being a sexual attraction. If they can do it, why can't a lesbian?
You're... a man.... therefore a lesbian.... can't like u
As an AFAB genderqueer person, I don't take offense to any potential partner's sexuality. I think if I identified as a binary trans man (have identified as a trans guy in the past, and it's totally possible that I could feel that in the future) I would feel uncomfortable with that on the surface, and communicate that to a partner if they continued identifying as a lesbian. But as other folks have said here, my partner's sexuality is their own, and has nothing to do with me. So if they explain that they identify as a lesbian because of their experiences and how they view their own identity and sexuality and gender, that's entirely up to them, and I'm okay with that. As long as they're not telling me ""Oh well I'm still a lesbian because you're AFAB"" because that's when it becomes an issue affecting MY identity.

If I were to start dating a straight girl, and she wanted to continue using the label of straight, even though I'm non-binary and queer, that's entirely up to her. If she told me she identifies as straight BECAUSE she sees me as a man, that's when I would be like hmmm I don't like this.

My partner's sexuality is not mine to define. If I'm uncomfortable with the way they view me, or if I feel fetishized in any way, or if I suspect there's some homophobia or transphobia built into their logic, I'm just not gonna date that person. But if I communicate with them about it, and understand that it's a claiming of their own identity, and has nothing to do with my identity, who am I to assign a sexuality to them?

Edit: I read another person's comment here about being demisexual, and I think that applies to where my logic is coming from. I identify as generally queer, but also like identifying as bi, lesbian, demisexual, and a dvke, because those are all the identities I feel belong to me at this point in my life. While I mostly date lesbians, if I were to ever be in a relationship with a man (regardless of them being trans or cis) I would still identify as a dvke / lesbian, because I'm mostly attracted to women, but my demisexuality sometimes allows me to form a romantic connection with men under the right circumstances. If my sexual identity made a trans man uncomfortable, I just..... wouldn't date him. Unless he understood that it's my own identity I hold in relationship to a very personal history of my sexuality and every non-sexual aspect that goes into it, not an identity defined exclusively by my relationship to him.
you’re absolutely right
Men do not fit in that circle.Women who only find it in women are lesbians and the subsets exist there.Some trans women only find it in trans women.Some cis women only find it in cis women.Speaking from a Pan point of view my opinion.
I'm so glad to see the overwhelming response here agreeing with OP, and recognizing trans men as real men.

I'm in a number of NB/Trans facebook groups and servers which all insist that it's totally normal for lesbians to make exceptions for transmen, to be a transmasc and continue calling yourself a lesbian, etc-- I've never understood these lines of rationing tbh. feels like so much compartmentalizing to me.

I'm not going to tell anyone else how to identify, honestly, but I honestly find all of it kind of ridiculous....
It’s complicated, because “Lesbian” is both an orientation and an identity/community. It’s perfectly valid to identify as a lesbian even if you occasionally date men. 

However, if a woman in a relationship with a trans man and calls it a lesbian relationship, that’s invalidating to the man’s identity and not a great thing to do.
I feel like most people confuse sapphic and lesbian, event lesbian people sometimes. Sapphic is much broader and can include non-binary and women-aligned people, not exclusively women. Also an orientation precisely describes... An orientation! Meaning, the """" goal"""", not the journey of I may phrase it that way. In other words, an orientation refers to preferences, not to one's actual dating/sexual/etc. behaviour. You can be a lesbian, have relationships with guys and still being a lesbian because, *in general* you prefer relationships with women and/or women aligned people.
It depends. I'm a lesbian, but rarely I would consider dating a man. I don't prefer men over women, but sometimes I'm just into men y'know? That being said, liking a trans man because you consider that person a woman is definitely invalidating them...
Sexuality is a spectrum. Nobody is attracted to a person’s gender. They’re attracted to their physicality or perhaps personality. Terms like gay, straight, and bi are too absolutist for anyone, especially if you’re dating someone who’s gender queer or currently transitioning
As long as the lesbian isn't doing it in a way that invalidates the trans man's identity (eg ""you're not a real man, so it's fine""). 
But yeah I think even if you identify one way, you are able to date outside of that, and that shouldn't erase who you are.
There was a pretty good show called ""Bob and Rose"" about a gay man who ends up dating a woman. He doesn't say he's bi now. He is gay, but he loves her.
Here’s my answer: Trans men are men. Lesbians are non-men loving non-men, which then means that if you’re a lesbian who’s in love with a trans man, then you’re not a lesbian because you’re then in love with a man!
I'm a lesbian, I've always identified as a lesbian and that identity is important to me. Having said that, there have been instances when I will see men who dressed or acted femininely and I have found them attractive. I don't think this should make me not a lesbian anymore.
Yes you are, to your title, because you are pushing your own feelings on other people.

On the other hand, if you are told that you need to feel ok with being pursued by lesbians or that *your female partner needs to be bi to be attracted to you* (😳) then you are being invalidated because they are pushing their feelings into you.

Essentially, always respect other trans people's identities. 

It does not impact your identity at all if some trans men date lesbians (or even if they *identify* as lesbians, like some trans men do), just like you aren't invalidating their identities by existing is a trans man who doesn't feel that way.

Gender is super complex and everyone experiences it differently. The beauty of being trans is accepting that.
can't is a bit strong. some people may identify as say lesbian, but then might find a man attractive. identity is not an immovable object, we are not defined by our identity, we define it. that being said, i would definitely tread cautiously if someone said they were a lesbian who were attracted to a trans man. could very well be a true, good faith statement, but a weary eye is valuable in the situation
there is a strong history between the transmasc community and the lesbian community- you will find people who are transmasc and still identify as wlw/lesbian (look up “cuspers” if you’re curious). but specifically trans MEN and lesbians? i think most would find that invalidating and dysphoria-inducing
I think it depends. If someone identifies as a lesbian because they like 95% of women and 5% of men, that's perfectly valid. I wouldn't be comfortable dating a ""straight"" guy, but that doesn't mean he would have to change his identify; if anything, we should break up if his identity invalidates mine. If other people are okay with dating someone who identifies in a way that doesn't exactly nod to them, than it's totally fine too. They're all just labels.

I identify as gay, but if I met a girl who I liked and we got together, I would call myself bi because I think that would probably tip the 95/5 scale.
Nah… we have levels to the amount of masculinity and femininity that we are attracted to. That’s simply your preference and there’s nothing wrong with that.
So how I see it is, trans men are men which would make a relationship where its a lesbian and a trans man a straight presenting relationship. Of course, lesbians can still like trans men, because sexuality is a complicated thing and it may be more towards personality than appearance.
I really thought we were moving out of the rigid sexual definition matrix and started moving towards a more analog representation of identity. Everyone here seems to be satisfied with pulling out their dictionaries and drawing the lines of what it means to be a ""lesbian"" and no matter what the dictionaries say this is all going to vary dramatically at the individual level.

To answer your top level question as written, yes, I'd say you are invalidating identities if you believe that X can't Y. It doesn't matter what terms you put in there. People can choose their own labels to help communicate their preferences and needs, and they can exceed and extend those labels however they see fit.
Trans men = men so lesbian excludes them. Trans-masc people don't have to be men so defining lesbians as non-men loving non-men, they can be included, but it's best placed down to the individual whether that label fits for them or not.  
As I am not a lesbian or trans-masc, I leave the issue for defining if the label lesbian means NMLNM or WLW up to others, I more frequently hear NMLNM.  
If someone dates a trans-man because they don't see them as a man so it's ""okay,"" they are transphobic.
Well, I know some lesbians go by the definition ""having a queer attraction to women"" under which a lesbian dating a man would perfectly fine. And while I obviously can't speak for any lesbian but myself, I feel like that definition does a much better job of describing my experience with sexuality, even though the ""nmlnm"" definition still fits me.

All in all, gender and sexuality are both very complicated, and we're all just figuring them out and using whatever labels are available to describe them best.
I mean...kind of? Just because someone is a lesbian doesn't mean they're not allowed to like whoever they like. They're even allowed to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't identify as a woman if they so please. Identities aren't hard rules they're guidelines with blurry borders. People can identify as lesbian one minute, decide they feel bi then be straight and go back to being lesbian and nobody really has any say in whether they're allowed to do that. 

How you identify is a personal choice that only you yourself have any say regarding.
I think it depends on the individuals involved.  Obviously, a lot of female-attracted transmascs feel exactly like you do, and you're perfectly entitled to insist on that boundary in a relationship that you're a part of.  If a female romantic partner referring to herself as a lesbian is a no-no for you, you can express that and, if it really is a deal-breaker for both sides, well that sucks but sometimes people are just incompatible.  

On the other hand, happy, consensual relationships between lesbian-identifying women and transmascs do exist, and I don't think that's anyone else's business - so long as both participants are content.  ""Lesbian"" can mean a bunch of different things in different situations - for example, a woman who is in an open/poly marriage with a man but strictly only hooks up with women may use ""lesbian"" to indicate that she is 100% not open to dating/sexing men, despite obviously being capable of attraction to a man (her husband).  If the husband is trans rather than cis, that doesn't really change anything (unless he has a problem with it, of course).  

Or, what if two AFAB nonbinary lesbians date each other?  Just because they both go on T or get top surgery or both doesn't mean they have to give up the ""lesbian"" identity/community/label if they don't want to. 

But, to be clear, I mean this strictly in the context of mutually consenting individuals using whatever label(s) they feel comfy with for themselves, personally.  When it comes to TERFy cis lesbians objectifying/fetishizing transmascs on the basis that they see them as butch women, that's just transphobic BS.
Your personal label is the one you choose. There are gay men who are in relationships with women and vice versa. But like someone else said, calling that relationship a lesbian relationship would be misgendering someone and be a bit transphobic.
I’ve heard of bi/pan lesbians and I don’t know how that works in terms of men. About trans women, I’ve seen some gay men wrongly chasing them, not recognizing them as women. There’s probably something to say about how Grindr’s “Trans” tag is used by trans women, trans men, enbies, and cis men with a different intent.

I refer to myself as trans (woman), non-binary, and vaguely masculine nouns sometimes, and I honestly don’t think sexual orientation even works with me. You’re attracted to me in a given way to some extent or you are not. Theoretically, I would have the best success with pansexual people.

Identifying as approximately bisexual, I can theoretically be attracted to any gender, but for some reason, no matter what that gender is, the attraction always feels gay.
So, it's complicated.  

Yes, words have meanings.  But Individuals don't always fit neatly into boxes, and if an individual wants to stay in their box or fly the flag or however else they claim the label, for honest reasons, however confusing, I would call them wrong.
unless they're using the split attraction model (as in their sexual orientation is lesbian and their romantic orientation includes attraction to men), then anyone identifying as a lesbian who's attracted to a trans man is either being transphobic or is in denial about their attraction to men. trans men are men, end of story.
I’m a dude and dating trans men doesn’t make me straight…because they’re men. So I’m wondering of a lesbian dating a trans men might be moreso bi?

Edit: typo
A binary trans man? Yes. That's not right but some trans masc people identify as lesbians and are fine with lesbians because technically they aren't fully men
They can't they are men and lesbian means non-women loving non-women ( nwlnw ) so they cannot love men if they love trans men they'd be bi or any sexuality that contains liking men and women
lesbians are fem-aligned attracted to fem-aligned, along with nonbinary folk  
transmen are not fem-aligned nor nonbinary  


overall, I agree, it seems super invalidating to basically be referring to a transman as a lesbian. that's basically what we've been called all our life because we're not guys, we're just masculine lesbians! (/s) it's the cycle all over again, but with a shitty gloss of paint over it.
I think sexuality is a complicated thing. For example, I’m transmasc. I usually call myself straight now (attracted to girls & some nonbinary people). But if someone dating me called themself lesbian, I’d be totally fine with it as long as they didn’t call me their girlfriend or say we were wlw or anything. I think being comfortable with it comes down to personal preference, but overall saying you’re lesbian and then being attracted to women, nonbinary people, and trans men but no cis men honestly just says “I don’t see you as really being a guy”. A trans man being a lesbian’s “exception” is fine, or if that lesbian is also attracted to cis men it’s fine, but if it’s just trans men, that’s pretty iffy.
(Sorry this was kinda rambling and repetitive! I just wanted to share my thoughts)
If sexuality is a broad spectrum, then I believe they can identify as one thing and cartainly act outside that identity in ways some might feel doesn't fit the definition of that label.

And as a trans woman married to a gay identifying man I feel I'm certainly not invalidated, you can't help who you love 💕

Though it certainly doesn't feel validating for people (especially those within the LGBTQ+ community) to knitpick words, labels and definitions.
Labels aren't always absolute, straight people can like the occasional person of the same gender, gay people can like the occasional person of the opposite gender. There are probably instances where this does happen due to transphobia but there are also going to be instances that aren't transphobic. Some lesbians might not like any men, some might like one or two specific men. Trying to define someone else's sexuality for them generally doesn't go over well.

tldr: sexuality is complex and no two people are identical. Let people define their sexuality for themselves no matter how they do so.
I think it's fair to be uncomfortable with that personally but lots of trans men / trans mascs have talked abt how those identities intersect. I'm trans masc (present like a man in a lot of my life also) and my gf is a lesbian. It comes down to what gender means to you imo
""Am I invalidating anyone's identity if I believe lesbians can't like **me**?""

There's no reason to put your beliefs into a generalization. If you don't want to be pursued by a lesbian, cool. Tell your pursuers no, then adjust your internal view.

If someone identified as lesbian and wanted to date ftm, don't worry about it; you've already set your boundary.

What you've written is just waiting to hurt someone's day for no good reason, *even if you're right.*

Have a good day.

Sexuality and gender are fluid. Many women identify as lesbian when they are bisexual because their preference for women is strongest. 

If it bothers you personally, talk to your partner about it.

If this is pertaining to other people's relationships... It's between them and their partner or love interest. 

I used to know a genderqueer lesbian, who at one point fully transitioned and once identified as trans man, then half detransitioned. She now dates a gnc trans man, and neither are bothered by the label lesbian.
I don’t care what label someone uses and who they are attracted to. Why impose your opinion on someone’s life/identity?
By being trans men, we aren't cis, so we are therefore inherently queer. Labels are the best term that fits at the time and people evolve. Lesbians also fall under the general queer umbrella. People are allowed to be attracted to anyone they want. No one is bound by a label that they placed on themselves. I will never understand gatekeeping when it keeps out people who are legitimately interested in being with you as a human.
Forcing everyone to accommodate to the same labels serves no purpose and is inevitably ostracizing to somebody. If somebody is a woman who dates women and being a lesbian is an important part of their self identity, it's kind of ridiculous for someone who isn't involved in the situation to insist that that woman drop the identity of ""lesbian"" because they're dating a trans man. Just leave them alone. It doesn't hurt anything. isn't that what we're always telling the right wing crazies? ""Just shut up and let me live my life. I'd you don't like it you can leave."" Why would you not practice the same tolerance you expect from others?
trans MEN or transMASCS? bc you can identify as a lesbian and like a transmasc, but you cant if you like trans men
(bc lesbian is nonmen loving nonmen)
Are you lesbian? 


If not how do you know if they can like trans men or not? Your answers really simple here. Stop over thinking things and focus on your own business
I think some trans mascs use it to signify that while they’re men they want a lesbian sorta relationship. I couldn’t tell ya the differences off the top of my head but there’s def a different vibe between a sapphic and a Hetero relationship for the most part
Technically, they can love men, but not feel romantic and/or sexual attraction toward them.

But yeah, in that context, it's invalidating, it's like saying ""transmen are butches"" or ""transgirls are femboys"".

There's a nuance to make for enbies, but I think most of transmasc enbies aren't willing to be called butches.
Idk. I'm non binary, and for a long time I thought of myself as a lesbian. Because, you know, girls.

Then I got a crush on someone I didn't know all that much about, asked around, and found out he was a trans dude. 

I spent a good while thinking about what this meant. Because I still liked him. I didn't think of him as anything other than a cute guy with great hair. But I never thought of myself as bisexual. I don't know. 

We're dating now, and I still don't know. I've never really told anyone I was a lesbian in the first place, so now my official position is that my sexuality is unlabeled. I like most girls, I like some guys, and fuck if I don't like non binary folk. No labels, no worries.
Trans men are men. So even if they're pre transition and a lesbian, not knowing theyre a man, has a physical attraction, when they realize the person is male, they should understand he will look more and more male over time and that he wouldnt want to be treated like a girl.
this isnt real, you are living in an echo chamber, no one in the real world cares, just fuck who u want
I identify as a lesbian because I am exclusively attracted to romantic relationships with women. I am also in a romantic relationship with two men. One is cis, one is ftm. 

Because I identify as NB, my partners and I usually just use the term “queer” relationship. I think that is the MOST appropriate when genders are blended. The way you identify isn’t changed based on who you are with—the identity of the relationship changes based on who you are with.

So calling myself a lesbian (something I realized after being married nine years and with my girlfriend who is now a man), is still correct. But the fact that they are both men excludes me from saying I’m in a wlw relationship.
To the best of my understanding, their are trans men that identify as butch/masc lesbians and trans women who identify as gay femboys/twinks, but that often wades into the realm of Blanchard and other transphobic gatekeepers.  Their “logic” is that trans people we recognize as straight are homosexuals that are transitioning due to external and/or internal homophobia.

I’d recommend being a little weary of anyone using these terms.  You’re gf probably has other reasons, but the trans people that agree with Blanchard almost always have lots of internalized transphobia and typically only except binary trans folks.

Transition changes or reveals many people’s sexualities.  You’re gf is probably working out what labels work for her or not.  I’m in a similar spot.  Being a lesbian always made sense to me, but now I’m questioning if I might be pan or something else.
Someone may perceive you as a woman/female, but that doesn’t have to invalidate your own self-perception.
[deleted]
Some people are hung up on genitalia some aren't. It's complicated, personally more trans lesbian woman but also ex cis het. More attracted to femme guys/trans women and trans men. Some trans men are attractive to me since there is some feminity left. Have a aversion to hair but not phased by more masc trans men in some cases.

Like super close to a stereotypical Dyke at work and out. Sexuality is complicated and not binary for me.
They could in the sense of QPRs (queer platonic relationship). They could also be homosexual while also being biromantic
It stems from the different ways we are misgendered.

To the transphobic world, a trans woman is a ""man"" trying to be a fox in the hen house. They generally ignore straight or non-monosexual individuals in opposite gender relationships, or just write them off as gay men trying to trick straight men.

For trans men, they are women who went to claim male privilege, or they are tom boys who are confused.

So, based on those stereotypes, it is less likely to be overtly considered for MLM relationships for a trans woman, because trans women are seen as sexual predators, out to invade women's spaces or trick men into gay sex.

Where as, because in TERF logic, trans men are just confused women, many TERF lesbians will fight that trans men are lesbians, because it continues their own rhetoric. (They often forget that some trans men are gay, because two dudes dating doesn't help their argument.)
I struggle with this. I'm mtf, and I've always felt extremely uncomfortable around men. From my own family to classmates, just...never felt safe around them. But I don't get that sense of danger from trans men. I don't know entirely why but I feel safe and comfortable and can usually pick up on a trans guy because of that. If I were to date a trans guy I would definitely say I'm straight, but otherwise I'm only attracted to women, and I wouldn't likely date a trans man for that reason.
 This entire problem (it’s not your problem you are completely correct) comes from people not understanding how labels work. You don’t just say you are one thing if you don’t fit the criteria for that. I can’t say I’m bisexual if I ONLY like one sex? Same way I can’t say I’m homosexual and then like two sexes
read the title. answer: No.

edit: read the body text. answer: its something ive seen as well, and i hate it. to keep this brief, whats happening is an overimportance on genitalia when relating to gender. thats simply transphobic. youre right, lesbians want women, think of a vagina as inherently female, and only date trans men (in these particular scenarios) because they *might* have one. thats a horrible reason to make an 'exception'. its not invalidating to say that op. its only the respectful thing to do if youre truly attracted to your partner to identify yourself at least a bit more fluidly in order to include that partner. the invalidation is coming from the other side.
I think it’s straight, your a guy so I don’t see why it wouldn’t.

And this is coming from another bi trans woman
There's this idea of heteroflexible/homoflexible. The idea there exists a spectrum of sexualities from fully being attracted only the opposite gender to fully being attracted to the same gender. this 'flexible' thing would be when you're on the verge of being fully straight or fully gay.   
On the  hand, this idea seems valid in my opinion. There are reported cases of cis wlw dating cis gay men once on a blue moon and dating the expected gender the rest of the time, so this could theorically extend to transpeople. On the other hand, not even mentioning the binarism of the whole thing, there is something iffy to me, because lot of those hetero/homoflexible stuff I heard were stories about cis lesbians or straight dude dating or having sex with a trans dude. And I do see in what way this could feel invalidating for transmen. This contribute also to my own insecurities as a trans fem lesbian because this is part of the trend of cis lesbians willing to date transmen and not willing to date transwomen.  
I'm not sure those lesbians should drop the label because they partook in this trend once or twice, but i definitely think that if you keep doing it you should have a good think.
I’ve just kinda dropped the lesbian label at all. I’m just pan. I let my relationships excitedly define and we discuss. I’m a relationship anarchist so they each are significantly individually that relationship. Many of mine are asexual and we feel close. 

I put more emphasis on being a feminist than a lesbian. I’m into people who are into feminism and things that don’t uphold patriarchal exceptionalism. I feel like so many lesbians aren’t “gold star” and feel separate from gold stars since sex labels get very focused around genitals, and for some reason people think your hangy thing makes your gender, not your consciousness. 

So your man might feel affirmed in a feminist relationship. Many of us I feel are connected to the feminism part of lesbianism but don’t count ourselves because of it’s politically/bodily exclusive nature.
Maybe that person's sexuality needs a better term.

For example I was born male, but I consider myself to be non-binary/gender fluid/post-genderist. I'm mostly attracted to femininity. So I like women and trans women. 

But let's be real. Some femme men look just as feminine as trans women, both gay and straight. And I can't deny that physically I'm still attracted to that.

Some might consider me straight because I'm attracted to femininity. But maybe some would consider me to have lesbian tendencies if they consider me to be a woman.

The same goes for men. If they consider me a man then I guess me being attracted to femme guys makes me a bit gay.

So if she's lesbian because she's attracted to a woman with masculine qualities...maybe it's not so weird/wrong/paradoxical. She could like a butch lesbian but not particularly care for boobs or vagina. Does this make sense?

It's all a spectrum. And tbh, I'm not an expert. I had my gender/sexuality crisis at the turn of the new year. I'm new. But this is what makes sense to me.
Eh. Sexuality is fluid and messy. I've had lesbian friends want to have sex with men every so often, and they still consider themselves lesbian.

I'd be very very hesitant to invalidate someone's own identity, if they've told me what it is.
trans men are men, so probably not
Bruh. I’m chill with that. Trans men are men. All the t4t girls I know that date trans men are masc attracted and consider themselves straight. They date trans men and cis men.

But like t4t is just a higher form of love. Where you love someone for how hot their body is.
If she wouldn’t gizzly globble on a cis dick, she ain’t gizzly globbling on mine.
Before anything else, trans men are men, and lesbian saying something like “as a lesbian I am attracted to all AFAB people” comes across as transphobic. That having been said, there is nuance in these terms. 

There are circumstances in which a lesbian might date or have sex with a trans dude. If we’re using the split model of attraction someone can be sexually attracted to certain groups but romantically attracted to other groups. Would it be inappropriate for someone who is sexually attracted to women but romantically attracted to others or vice versa to refer to themselves as a lesbian? I don’t think so. 

Rigid labels aren’t particularly helpful. Ultimately what I want out of these labels is for them to serve people. By holding ourselves to overly strict definitions we make communication difficult. I could say “I’m a homoflexible panromantic abrosexual non-binary woman who is almost exclusively attracted to other women even when my sexuality shifts to include other genders and is open to dating anyone but is only ever seeking women because that’s where my primary interests lie and dating someone who I may stop being sexually attracted to adds complexity to the relationship.” Or, because that requires a lot of explantation to express a fairly simple idea, I can just say “I’m a lesbian,” and my non-binary partner can be fine with that because they understand that there’s nuance and flexibility in the language that we use. I refer to myself as queer, but there was a time that I called myself a lesbian and despite all those caveats a couple sentences ago the term was a pretty accurate description of how I navigated the world.

My personal experience is pretty specific, but there are plenty of cases of like lesbians who realized they’re trans men or non-binary who are now faced with this issue of losing their entire community. Rather than leaving them out in the cold we could just say, “if you want to keep being a lesbian you can do that. You’re welcome here.” 

There are too many potential edge cases for us to say, hardline, that people from X group must be/do this or that. It would be more useful for us to say that, at the core, [group] are people who [thing], and then treat it as a gradient that radiates in all directions and commingles with other identities’ gradients. This preserves the sort of quintessential image of the group while being inclusive enough to encompass all those who want/need inclusion in the group.
I kinda want to weigh in here, when I had met my ex they where none binary but after month and a bit they said that they where transgender. That never really bothered me because I had loved them either way... sadly it didn't work out in the end, but that's the way life is sometimes
You clearly have a point. For my case, I identify as a transbian, because I'm attracted almost exclusively by women, but it still can be exception. One of my partners is a cis man, so I probably more of a bisexual/homoflexible, but for some reason I hardly identify with that label and I am way more comfortable with the transbian one.

>why would they not want to change their label to something that is inclusive of masculine identities

This sentence you said clearly give me something to think. Maybe identifying as transbian can be bad for my male partner ?

I have already thank about this : does this feeling come from ""internalised heterophobia"" (internalised homophobia as I grew up male but reversed because as trans I'm female) or something like ""compulsive homosexuality"" (same principle) ?

So I don't know how to say that when speaking, but for the writing part maybe something as TransBIan (or Trans-Bi-an would be a more inclusive variations ?

I would like to have people opinions about that :)
This is such a complicated series of discussions, in my opinion, because labels are subjective and not objective. People are free to use whatever label they like and define it as they wish for themselves, but they must also realize that not everyone else will jive with their definition of the label. 
I’m a trans guy in a relationship with a once hard-core lesbian. The thing is, even before me, my afab nb partner was sexually more expansive than “lesbian” would suggest. My transition has been difficult on my partner, not from an attraction perspective, but from an identity perspective. They have had to reconsider their self label because it made me feel invalidated. 
Ultimately, someone’s label is theirs to define, but it can still feel invalidating to their partner. If they refuse to consider your feelings, then I see that as problematic from a relationship perspective. If their label is more important than the relationship, then people will end up hurt. 
Open to different interpretations and perspectives! Hopefully I got my thoughts across somewhat coherently.
If a lesbian woman, as in not a bisexual woman with a preference, is seriously interested in a binary trans man post hormones, then she is likely fetishizing at best and transphobic at worst.

I will say humans don't control their attraction, so a pre hormone trans man may be attractive to a lesbian, but that doesnt mean it doesn't then become an issue if she finds out he is trans and decides to pursue a lesbian relationship with him, especially if she then pressures him into delaying a transition for the sake of her attraction. If she says OK maybe I am bisexual and respects his identity as a man in pursuing a relationship that's different.

Gender and sexuality are fluid so it's hard to definitively say any lesbian identified woman attracted to any trans identified man is wrong, but when the binary is established and it becomes a woman only attracted to women being attracted to a trans man because of his vagina and her perception of vaginas=womanhood thats a problem.
I know some trans men and some nb masc people are okay with it, but me personally? I would NOT date a lesbian, I'd actually be insulted if a lesbian tried to date me.
A lot of these terms are used as umbrella terms which is why when you break down into the nuance behind it it can get confusing. Before anyone reads further I would like to reiterate this is just my interpretation and understanding of these terms through the language and history that surrounds the LGBTQ community. Trans men and trans masc fall under the same umbrella but they carry slightly different connotations and blend with other identities in their own unique ways. We all know that the trans umbrella also holds the non-binary umbrella in the non-binary umbrella holds trans masc as well. There's binary trans umbrella (trans men/trans women) and the non-binary trans umbrella (trans masc/trans fem).
Lesbianism is a very interesting especially through the historical perspective because historically the gender concept of what a woman was was directly linked to what a man was. So a lot of lesbians didn't feel like an actual woman because how the gender woman was defined by society was in relation to men when lesbians didn't want any relation to men. This is why the non-woman loving non-woman label applies here historically. The term lesbian has changed in its definition and interpretation through society many times. A lesbian icon for example is Sappho and now there's a new developing sexuality label called sapphic because the modern interpretation of the word lesbian was heavily altered after the terf invasion around/during the 70's. Sapphic is a new reclamation of the original interpretation of the word lesbian (non-man loving non-man). 
So if a non-binary trans masc individual was comfortable being in a relationship with a lesbian through the interpretation of the non-man (still masc) loving non-man it'd be fine. If a binary trans man was in a relationship and the person wanted to continue to refer to them as a lesbian they would be wrong and an asshole. A lot of these conversations rest on the fact that when you're with a person you need to establish what language is and isn't okay with each other as individuals. 
Once again this is just my interpretation of these umbrella labels and individual preferences are unique to the individual because everybody's gender and sexuality has added nuance unique to them that can't easily be contained/commincated with that one umbrella label.
This entire conversation has me wondering what do you call a non-binary person loving non-binary person (nblnb or enbylenby)?
Related Question for other trans men in the comments, do you think feeling dysphoria from someone who identifies as lesbian dating you could be a signifier that you're transmasculine/ trans man? Context: I have been unsure if I'm NB or Trans Masculine for a while now but I feel a bit uncomfortable when I am approached on dating sites etc by people with 'lesbian' as their sexuality or with things like 'women only' in their bio. Do any NB people feel this way or is it mainly Trans Men?
I'm a female (Cis) who has dated a trans female (mtf) and I was strait prior. However I fell in love and had announced a change in my sexuality as Pan. Me dating someone who hasn't had genital surgery isn't saying I'm strait. As I didn't love them for their body. I would still love them if they got surgery or not.
I think it's disregarding of an actual person to date someone based on their biological gender. If your only into females and date a trans male, you are disrespecting their identity and are only seeing their body as their biological gender.

Sadly, trans often get used for kinks, for their body, and so on. It's a common issue and leads for distrust when it comes to dating. I can only dream of how painful it must be to think someone accepts your real identity, but in reality only used you for a kink.
Well, there's a difference between homosexual and homoromantic though
I am all for people identifying however is most comfortable to them, but I do believe that arguing about it is arbitrary and often just ends up being transphobic. I personally believe that lesbian means non-men dating and being attracted to eachother. Trans men do not fit in that definition, and therefore can technically not be lesbians or in lesbian relationships. However, again, I support people labelling themselves however they feel most comfortable. I'm not going to tell a trans man who labels themselves as a lesbian they're wrong. The topic is pretty nuanced and difficult to not offend someone because it's as sensitive as people's identity.
Trans men are men - I'm a transbian and have trans guy friends and don't feel attracted to them.  Great friends, though.
on a simple level, i wouldn't say that's an inherently bad view, but it becomes more complicated when you apply it to people who transition while in lesbian relationships and remain in said relationship and both partners are still attracted to each other.
[deleted]
The thing is... is just like there are people who only dated straight but are actually bi, there are people who date only gay but are actually bi. I think it comes to how society is. A man is seen by a woman dating gay as so unlikely to have those traits like sensitivity, openness, acceptance due to how society feels to be for her, that she just forfeits that playground all together. So its not really invalidation of identity, its more like they arent going to identify as bi if they arent going to date cis men due to their perceptions, even though in a non-gendered society anything would be on the table. I think you get where I am getting at with a transman... she sees them as much safer option which is can firmly confess she will give a chance to as they are perceived to be much more likely to be able to sympathise with womanly issues and be open as people who are seen as born as the sex that is allowed to be sensitive.

These are obviously all stereotypes, but they are most likely subconcious and people just don't realise it...
They can it depends what they like. If a trans man has a vagina it could still be attractive. I know of a lesbian transmasc relationship where she still identifies as lesbian. As well my friends that are straight aren’t into anything other than a 
Natal penis so trans masc doesn’t work. But I think it’s ok to have our own preferences even if it might seem invalidating. You do you and find those that are cool with you the way you are. No one is ever going to please everyone.
It would bother me. 

I’m also a trans man. I would be really bothered if my partner identified as a straight man, or a lesbian woman. Because I am not a woman. And I believe, if they are using those labels then they are lumping me in with women. 

I recognize Butch female identities. Those are perfectly valid and if they are a he/ him lesbian then that is perfectly fine. 

But I personally am not. 

I would hope my partner would be inclusive of me in the same way I would want my identity to be inclusive of them.
I don't have the same standards as you. People are complicated, they're identities are complex and people don't always expect who will make them horny. I just want to be desired by someone decent who doesn't mind that my desires aren't exactly innocent either.

I don't mind a self identifying lesbian lusting after me. I might just like them back.
No, you're not invalidating anyone by saying that. As an ftm guy, I'm sick of the ""it's not transphobic if trans it's towards trans *men.* It's only transphobic if it's towards the IMPORTANT trans people"" mentality. It fucking *stings.* I agree, we're not your quirky masc girlfriend. Part of the reason I don't date is because I would *hate* to be called someone's ""girlfriend.""

If you identify as a lesbian and have an exception, that I would consider different. Most people use a binary sexuality label, but I think sexuality is fluid/a spectrum, and I think a lot of heterosexual/homosexual people might find there are a few people they'd make an exception for, but that group is so small that they don't change their label for them, if that makes sense. But that's a different can of worms, and I think if you identified as a lesbian then met a trans man you were attracted to you *could* date him, however at the point where you actually started dating him you two would need to have a discussion about what labels he's okay with. I'm at a point where I'm not secure enough in my masculinity to be a lesbian's ""exception"" without feeling invalidated, but I think I could date a bi girl with a preference for women.
I'm a transwoman and actually see myself as bisexual, but I feel attracted more often to women, until I perceive that I'm bi, I felt like lesbian, because until that moment, I only get attracted to women, but then came my first boyfriend, he was a transman (was, because he regret transicioning and identifies as a cis woman now), and changed my label to bi, because I was atracted by him, a man, but we broke up and she told me that she felt like a girl, that being trans was a fase, I don't know, she cheated me so I don't pay any attention to her problems on that moment, and started to think, if she was a girl and just pretend to be a man, what by her words was an error, so I still lesbian and my attraction to her was of two women? And I still on this doubt, until my husband get on the scene, a cis man, and I felt attracted to him, so I perceived, yeah, I'm bi.

So, with this long story, if someone don't make any effort to change their label to include your gender, this person isn't worth your time.
this is basically just the age-old ""I'm not into trans women because I'm not gay"" argument on their part, and is just as invalidating.
As a bi person, I feel like self-bi erasure also might be at play when people identify as lesbians and date trans guys.
Trans men are men and at the same time identity is personal, nuanced, and valid. 

In general terms, no, lesbians aren't into men. 

There are, however, people who identify as lesbians who are or have been attracted to one or more men or group if men.

Both of these things are true.
i feel that it is up to the individual how they want to identify and it's a conversation that should be had between partners. defining anything as objective fact removes the purpose of the freeing nature of the queer community - and if anyone disagrees with me that is fine too.
I agree. Trans men are men.
Personally, my girlfriend identities as a lesbian and I’m a fairly masc trans guy - I’m not binary but the non-binary part isn’t like, fem leaning. But I really don’t mind because I know her attraction is like… 85fem/15masc and it’s easier and gives her a space in her specific community for her to just say lesbian. It’s not just a description of attraction it’s also an important community place and personal identifier.

We also refer to our relationship as a queer and as a gay relationship comfortable even though she’s a girl and I’m a guy because that’s what fits our relationship.

Personal identity is very YMMV. I know she’s not invalidating my gender. But if another lesbian I didn’t know as well situationally approached me I’d be like uhhhhhhh……………

So… Yeah, it’s situational and personal. Everyone’s life and personal identity and relationships and the words they used to describe them are different.
So here's the thing: both lesbian and gay are terms that can be used as a standalone sexuality, and part of a sexuality.

I had a friend who was pansexual, but homoromantic. She was sexually attracted to anyone, including men, but she was not romantically interested in anyone but women. So she'd also refer to herself as a lesbian. Another friend of mine was omnisexual, but 90% of her attraction was towards women, so she'd refer to herself as a lesbian all the time, even being married to a man. The way I see it, lesbian can be used the same way we use ""gay"" -- as an alternative to queer, to say ""I am not straight"". Personally, I prefer using ""queer"" because I don't like people assuming I'm only into men, because I'm not. I'm pan, so I'm attracted to anyone within my age group (or older; I have a thing for men in their 40s like whyyyyyy 😭).

My line is drawn when you don't identify under an mspec sexuality, but JUST ""lesbian"", and ESPECIALLY if you specify ""I am not attracted to men"". If you're not attracted to cis men but you're attracted to trans men, then you're just transphobic. I've straight up called cis people out on their ""I date trans men but not cis men"" bullshit and blocked them, because we are NOT a separate category. I am a man. Being trans is only a part of the descriptor.

Anyone that claims to not be attracted to men but dates trans men is a transphobic chaser. Anyone who's bi/poly/pan/omni, also identifies under the lesbian label, and is attracted to men is fine. If you're feminine-leaning and you want to make it clear to the world that you're not a straight fem and you don't want to use the term queer? You're fine with me. But the moment you have ""no men / men DNI / I hate men / etc."" and you try and hit on me, a trans MAN? Get fucked.

EDIT//
I do want to say, I hold an exception to the ""not attracted to cis men but attracted to trans men"" rule, which is if you're also trans. If you say you're not attracted to men at ALL then that's not gonna fly, but T4T specifically makes sense to me, because a lot of us trans folks have issues trusting cis people in general and feeling safe around them privately due to the rampant amount of violence against us. T4T isn't transphobic, it's a safety measure. Cis people only being attracted to trans men but not cis men, or trans women but not cis women, are transphobic and can eat shit.
Another reason why sexuality labels are very limiting and not fit for purpose most the time. It’s entirely personal your sexuality and how it interacts with your gender and others gender. I’m transmasc and my girlfriend is transfem we are both queer but our relationship feels more like a lesbian relationship more than anything else but neither of us are ‘women’ 😆
It depends.

I identify as a lesbian, because like 99 times out of 100, I am only into women.

But like, I'm not willing to fully rule out being attracted to men (or other genders for that matter) because... it happens.

I could say I'm a Abrosexual Demisexual Demiromantric demipan-lesbian and confuse people, or I can say I'm a lesbian, which gets me 99% of the way there.

If you don't like someone indentifying as a lesbian dating you because they view you as being ""Man-Lite"" that's hella understandable, because that's garbage.

But like, I'd still consider myself a lesbian if I were. And if a partner wasn't okay with that, then we're not compatible romantically, and I would not date them.
bi lesbians arent real and trans men are men you are right
Could be. but why share a marginalizing opinion. live and let live. You do you
[deleted]
Hey, trans femboy here, I would absolutely take offense if a lesbian were to approach me to date without immidiately changing their label or showing willigness to do so. Much less actually be in a relationship with a person who still identified as lesbian, I would absolutely not agree to that.

 I feel like most trans femboys would feel the same, most of us went through a lot of trouble to sort out our gender and our alignment with femininity, and still consider ourselves just as much a man, as any cis femboy or non-femboy cis man would. 

I personally think lesbian means attracted to females and female alinged genders. 

Sexuality is complicated of course, and I arrived at this conclusion about lesbians: Most lesbians who are attracted to butch lesbians still think of butches as fully female.And find masculinity their masculinity attractive spesifically because they are women. But there might be a smaller group that have a more complicted relationship with masculinity and their attaction to it, and might actually be closeted bi, pan etc. Leading to some less considerate or insecure ppl disripecting their partners identity in the effort to finding their own sexuality. At least that's my take on it.
Yes, but they could identify as Bi. Just because you are in a straight presenting relationship, doesn't mean you aren't bi still. 

Same with like beinf aro/ace. Still aro and/or ace even if you're in a straight presenting relationship. 

Combos of these can also exist (like biromantic lesbians, or 

The issue comes when someone identifies as purely a lesbian and nothing else, and then yet is in a relationship with someone who is a man, like trans men. Then that seems like an issue of the person not validating their partner's gender.
I believe nb is always gay
I somewhat understand but would it not be invalidating to a trans man dating a lesbian to hear them call themselves a lesbian in every way outside of their relationship? Being seen as an exception would personally make me feel not wanted or like their attraction to me was a mistake.
this is how i feel! i (AFAB) was dating a gay guy for a while. sometimes relationships transcend gender and sexuality.
So basically they just…aren’t using the right labels
lesbians like non men. being a trans masc does not necessarily mean you are a man. you cannot conflate trans mascs with only trans men because there are non-binary trans mascs and people who are trans masc with no other added label. 

just like how gay ppl can be trans femme, lesbians can be trans masc.
[deleted]
Yeah i was considering that, though wouldn't someone who specifically doesn't date only cis men still fall under the bisexual umrella?
Tbh I personally wouldn't date someone who thinks I'm super different from a cis man somehow. The only exception is people who are *specifically* only T4T. But yeah, I would certainly never date a cis person who wouldn't date cis men. I would probably assume they're transphobic, at least towards trans men.
yeah, not recognizing trans guys as guys and having problems with dating trans women is 100% a terf thing to do.
I'm glad someone said it. It seems to come down to the fact that some people don't see trans men as men and trans women as women. I think it is as simple as that.
Yeah, research into this still shows a very large majority of cisgender lesbians willing to date trans men, with only a small minority who would consider dating a trans woman.
Exactly how I see it. It never occurred to me that this would even happen, and it makes me really sad to think some self identified lesbians would consider dating trans men without changing their label. 

A good point someone else said though is that being trans masculine is a whole other deal and you can identify as trans masc without identifying as a man, although I still feel this would be a very rare exeption, you'd have to be non-binary and/or AFAB I feel to just barely still fit into the lesbian umbrella. Which I personally at least see as: attracted to female or female (Feminine?) alinged genders. 

Being attracted to trans men and women would still fall under bisexual, and in my opinion trans masculine and women also, just like non-binary and women would. Although I think there's a spesific label for being attracted to those two only as well.
you don't get to define other peoples sexuality
op isnt saying it has to include trans guys.
gatekeeping sexualities
This is a perfect take IMO. Your labels are yours, their labels are theirs, and as long as they don't project their labels onto you it literally doesn't matter.

Are you attracted to them? Do you like them? Is the same true in reverse? Life's too short to worry about anything else.

And as you say, there are lots of non-romantic reasons to have various labels and identities. Gender and sexuality are complicated 😂
Thank you for this comment. I've always been of the same opinion as OP, but your comment is making me rethink my position. You bring up a good point. How long someone has identified as a specific label and their role in activism are definitely factors I hadn't considered before
🥺 this made me happy
Yep. Many trans men and transmasculine people identify as lesbians, even though they arent women. There is a long story for the word ""lesbian"" and many texts written about how they identify as butch lesbians, but not as women. Labels are as complex as the people using them.

However I understand OP has a point, one might feel invalidated by their partner's sexuality. It's an important dialogue we should have.
So much this. Not to minimize how big a part of someone's identity being able to acknowledge their sexuality can be, but like so many thing in life, straight/gay/lesbian/bi are an attempt to put into discreet 'buckets' something that actually exists on a (or on several, really) spectrums. There's plenty of 'straight' people who aren't a perfect 0 on the Kinsley scale. At the end of the day, the only determining factor as to if one consenting adult is 'allowed' to be attracted to another is... if said adult is attracted to other adult.
 It is, and in my opinion is exactly why using the label of lesbian while in a relationship with a trans man even more inconsiderate and offensive, since there are so many different labels you could use to identify your sexuality that includes your current partners identity.
For some people, but not everyone, and if someone is attracted to only women and says as much, then they shouldnt be invalidating a trans man by trying to hook up w or date them
Lol that's kinda the point of linguistics... like let people keep labels if they want, but dont just throw out the whole dictionary rofl
I think your definition of sapphic is actually what lesbian means, at least the modern, generally accepted definition.

Sapphic is an umbrella term that includes lesbians and bi/pan/omni women/nonbinary people, of course if they want it to. A bisexual woman who is attracted to binary men may choose to id as sapphic to emphasize their attraction to women, or they may use bisexual as their main label but still feel included in sapphic spaces. I believe, historically, lesbian meant this too but over time it evolved to strictly exclude men.

I love your take on this though. I feel like people place too much importance on rigidly staying within the ""official"" definition of a label.
I personally disagree with this, as it does and could invalidate a lot of minorities identities, and also simply I feel isn't truthful. And is and could be deceiving for other people as well, leading to the erasure of other sexualities and gender identities. Especially as a bi trans man, if my attraction women was very small, and I was only attracted to trans women, AND had datedb only men, I would still consider myself bi, spesifically because I am still attracted to trans women. And I would be erasing my attraction to transwomen, and invalidating the existence and identity of transwomen. As well as possibly making people think transwomen aren't real women, among other things.

Basically the same but opposite scenario as what we're discussing.

 Labels for sexuality encompass all of our sexuality, not just parts of it or only spesific parts of it that are a minority you're comfortable invaliding because of bigorty.
“Nobody is attracted to a person’s gender” 🤨
Hey could you maybe put a tw or use a different word when talking about your sexuality. F** is a slur and has been used to hurt people, and while it is ok in private, private ly not the best idea to use it publicly with strangers
Because it’s transphobic?
But what about the trans man? She's either not seeing him as a man, because as she says, shes only attracted to women, or she is attracted to men. It's not fair to insult a trans man that way and insinuate they're a girl.  And the reason we have labels is because we have language and we wanted something to describe ourselves and use those words to navigate the world and find similar people.  It's cool if someone doesn't want to label themselves, , but we should respect the labels others have and not try to rewrite them.
but If they’re using it to imply they think your a woman and it makes you uncomfortable then that’s a dick move
>my girlfriend who is now a man

I'm sorry but that sounds very transphobic and is very invalidating to trans men, even if you are referring to their past self.
I don’t think you’re a lesbian dude
Umm. No.
>Some trans men are attractive to me since there is some feminity left.

Please don't say this to anybody, it's invalidating and offensive.

>More attracted to femme guys/trans women

Also this. Not remotely the same category. 

It might be no big deal for you but it won't hurt to be more thoughtful with what you're saying.
Hey, somewhat stereotypical dyke looking transman here. Don't ever include me under the lesbian label. I am a man, and the lesbian label spesifically exludes men. Don't be transphobic. Please and thank you.
psst your wording makes it sounds like bi people can't love trans people, and that is invalidating bi people and making them seem like bad people. You might want to rephrase so you don't hurt bi people.
I’m really confused, isn’t being a lesbian being solely attracted to women? I’m sorry if this is offensive but from what I know being bi and being lesbian are different things
Bisexual lesbians? I’m pretty sure that doesn’t make any sense does it? I’m a non man loving exclusively women but I like all genders…
Bestie what. Bisexual lesbians don’t exist 😭
Genuinely confused about this. How can someone be bisexual and a lesbian? Like I can understand aro lesbians or ace trans bisexuals, but isn’t bisexual and lesbian a mutually exclusive group? Like you can’t be a gay straight person or a cis trans person? Not trying to be offensive just confused.
BISEXUAL LESBIANS ??? loll
I think where this is an exception to things is that they may be like... say Bi romantic, but homosexual in the wlw/ wlnb way (or visa versa). This is then fine and not invalidating of a trans man's gender, because they are then still identifying as bi (romantically or sexually in this case). You don't have to be sexually attracted to someone to be in a relationship with them. Same with sexual attraction. You don't have to be romantically attracted to someone to be in a relationship with them. 

It is a rare case to see someone who isn't sexually or romantically interested in someone and don't fall somewhere on the ace/aro spectrum.... 

And I know for certain that I would be pretty upset if my partner still identified as a lesbian, and purely a lesbian, while in a relationship with me (a trans man).
This is wrong. Bisexuals are not lesbians. I am wlw, but I also like men
oh no! i meant there are sexualities specific to liking feminine traits. i wasn't saying it's acceptable for a lesbian to like a femboy. i hope that clears things up. i can also understand if that still offends you, just let me know!
Another trans femboy here, and i agree 100%!
Trans non-binary femboy lesbian here 👋 you're perfectly valid in feeling invalidated by the idea of dating lesbians, it makes sense for binary men to feel very uncomfortable with that. Especially binary trans men, who would often feel dysphoric in that situation. 

I will add that being a lesbian isn't just about loving femme aligning folks, there are plenty of masc lesbians and even transmasc lesbians as well. I'd encourage anyone confused by the idea of transmasc lesbians (I am one myself and would be happy to answer any questions) to check out r/butchlesbians . It has an amazing community of lesbians all over the gender spectrum! 

I myself am attracted to some masc folks; I'm not attracted to binary men (cis or trans,) but I am attracted to non-binary men in a very queer way, and while internally I'm much more boyish than girlish, my lesbian identity is still important to me and just...feels the most correct, really, is what it comes down to. I love in a queer and sapphic way.
Agreed. Being invalidated by your own partner would be horrible.
What?
The way I see it is that lesbians are more than welcome to be into non-men, but as a transmasc person dating someone who is lesbian-identified makes me dysphoric. That’s a me problem, not a them problem, so it is MY preference, not theirs.
Many trans men feel that way; I certainly do. But that's not an argument for not believing that someone can identify as a lesbian and also like trans men. People exist who fit that description, so saying you don't believe it's possible is kinda silly. What you can do though is:

* not date them (I don't)

* when you encounter them and it comes up, talk to them about it, and bring up what you said here. Sometimes they have more complex reasoning behind how they navigate their identity, and sometimes it's just weird invalidating crap, and sometimes you can talk them through that crap into either renavigating how they communicate their identity, or how they see trans men. Starting out the gate by telling them they aren't lesbian generally just results in defensiveness, and they're likely to just associate anyone invalidating their lesbian identity as the same homophobia all over again, even though obviously it isn't.
I'm a trans man and I literally don't care. Someone's identity does not invalidate mine.
One person identifying themselves as something cannot invalidate what another person identifies as. Also let's not get radicalized here...
I guess one question is, would a cis man feel invalidated by being the partner of a lesbian, and being their ""one exception""? Heck, a cis dude might even feel flattered by it! 

I know it is more complicated here, but I would argue that being secure in your gender is important. Hard to achieve (I haven't) but a good goal. 

Your partner in the other hand is explicitly invalidating your gender by stating that a person would *have to* be into women to want to be with you. That's a very different thing, and she is being an asshole.
I think sexuality is more fluid and imprecise than can necessarily be exclusively and immutably described by any single label, so if someone identifies with one label and they're not using it in the improper context (such as it would be improper to call a relationship with a man a lesbian relationship) I think it doesn't help much to gatekeep what people call themselves.
I disagree on that definition of lesbian. Lesbians are WLW... however I also see the complicated case where you are coming from where Enby's often times need to be lumped into one group or the other.

I personally would imagine it rather invalidating to be a masc enby, and be told that I am a lesbian if I like other enbys or women... it implies that I would still be a woman.

That being said, I very much am a woman, so I am only guessing how I would feel.
not everything is about men dude. I've never heard gay be described as 'non women loving non women'. If you wanna be a guy and call yourself a lesbian, don't be surprised if women into women are turned off by that.

Also, attraction/orientation tends to be physical. If you're an enby presenting fem, people into fem people will likely be attracted to you. Vice versa for masc enbies.

Well sadly it sounds more opened to cis men. I’m one of those girls myself, and while i could totally fall in love with a trans guy if i bond with them and feel like our journey is similar and brings us closer… that would never happen with a cis man. So yeah finding the right term is hard, people just should make sure they don’t hurt anyone in the process
Yes
I’m not a cis person ? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Yeah, I'm personally trans woman Butch lesbian and I cannot really imagine I'm dating cis guy or trans guy omg even I'm preferring females more on masculine spectrum rather than girly girls.
Believe or not, I'm living in that kind of relationship with my cis hetero wife. I'm out to her more than a year and I'm also almost a year on HRT, she doesn't see me as woman, I'm not passing at all and this is probably also one of the reasons she's still with me. If I would go high femme in presentation our relationship would not survive, that's for sure. That's it.
Could an amab trans woman who's also butch not be considered trans masc?
/i/ do not. dictionary definitions, on the other hand, have nothing to do with me labelling other people and everything to do with, you know. human language. words having meanings et cetera
I’m not saying he is.

The “no” is to his question of whether he’s gatekeeping. The explanation that follows is why he’s not.
What do you mean by “gatekeeping”?

Because lesbians are attracted to women and some non-binary people, not to men. That’s not gatekeeping.
Are you stupid?
I understand OP's position and honestly I could see myself feeling the same way. It would depend tho. 

If a heterosexual woman wanted to date me and said ""I still consider myself het, but I am attracted to you"" then I'd be fine with it. If she said ""I still consider myself het because you're a man who I'm attracted to"" then I wouldn't be.
It's possible to date someone outside what you're orientation is, or else ace and aro people couldn't date anyone.
I never said you are not free to use the label you feel the most confortable with ? The thing is that labels are, by essence, changing deping on many factors. One of them is, simply, culture. That's why you cannot say : this label means X and only X, because while that might be true for you, it might not be the same for others. Labels are fluid, so are identities.
It's the same thing with bi and pan. They may describe the exact same thing for some people, and not at all for others. But, who cares? Use the label you feel most confortable with, you can even change depending on your environment or feelings or really anything, and that's not up to anyone to force you to use something else just because ""iT doeSnT meAn tHat"".
Also, no identity invalidates others. Some identities that may seem, and may be, very similar can co-exist. Once again, it's more a matter of feeling and others things such as cultural background, and its totally valid to have two labels for the same things, and to prefer one over the other. However, that doesn't not allow anyone to say they know better, and you should use X label instead of Y because they know more than you and your are X, even if you know you are X or feel more confortable with :) be who you are, that's always better than being anyone else
Oh shit yes of course!! So sorry
Accepting identities doesn’t mean accepting transphobia. I’m saying that someone shouldn’t feel justified in having an opinion about someone else’s labels or identity. 

I don’t care if your LGBTQ+… don’t spend your time trying to gatekeep who can do what with who while identifying as whatever. Let’s get past that. 

If it wasn’t clear, fuck transphobes.
It's between those two people, not strangers judging from a distance. Are you really going to walk up to one of those peoples' trans masc partners and be like ""Hey, did you know your partner doesn't respect your gender identity?"" I mean it's absurd.

I am a trans woman. I have a long time partner who is cis female and entered into a relationship with me before I came out as myself. She identifies as straight. Shes not with me because she is a lesbian, she is with me because I am her partner and she chose not to leave me because I transitioned. She sees herself as a more or less a straight woman. If someone tried to tell her she was a lesbian in the face of her insistence to the contrary, that person and I would have a problem.

TL;DR you have no right to tell anyone else what their identity is. Thats literally the entire point of the queer rights movement.
u/gethenmostad apparently this is transphobic to state that you were my girlfriend.
I share an account with my partner. I’m AFAB but identify as NB femme.
What gives you the right to tell other people their sexuality is invalid?
I would encourage you to check out r/butchlesbians . There are plenty of transmasc, non-binary, and cis butches out there, and this extends to other ways of presentation within the lesbian community as well. 

I'm a trans non-binary lesbian myself, and I play around with all kinds of presentation, but internally I'm much more boyish than girlish. I feel best being feminine in the way that feminine men are, that's just who I am. I'm a lesbian because it best describes how I love: I love queer people who aren't binary men (cis or trans) in a queer way. 

If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer any - even if you think they could be seen as rude or insensitive, my DMs are open as well. Just want to help educate with compassion.
Oh my bad
I’m not sure what they said, but a lesbian is a non man attracted to a non man, non binary people fit into the label as well

I don't know what exactly the person you're responding to is referring to, but I know personally that I am a pansexual lesbian which, for me, means that I am attracted to any gender sexually, and attracted romantically to people who aren't exclusively men.

That does clear things up, thank you. I do think it's debatable whether or not, and how much if, feminine/masculine traits play a part in sexuality. 

Personally I think sexuality should only be used to refer to what gender/genders one is attracted to. 

Of course there probably are exeptions in everything, but since feminine men are still men, and masculine women are still women, I'd say feminine genders is more accurate than feminine traits.
Yay! Trans femboy solidarity brother! 🏳️‍⚧️🫂
I'm confused by your use of Non-binary men. If they are non-binary: they're non-binary, regardless of if they are AFAB or AMAB. Do you mean gendefluid,genderflux, and/or bigender individuals identity as men? 

Cause I think at that point that the person's gender isn't male/ strictly male, and therefore would still fall under the definition of homosexuality as a whole where it is ""genders similar aligning to or the same as one's own gender"". But if you are seeing AMAB Nonbinary folk as ""Men"", then that is kind of invalidating of their gender, even if you aren't intending to. 

I'm not trying to be offensive or anything or call you transphobic if you aren't. I'm just trying to understand, and maybe bringing to light something not considered before.
They're referring to a sentiment that a lot of nonbinary people hold which basically says ""any and every relationship with me is gay regardless of the gender of my partner.""  I'm not saying this is what your partner meant/ that they weren't being invalidating, but as a afab genderfluid enby; I would call my relationship gay even if I was dating a straight cisgendered guy. I'm a boy and a girl and neither so to me everything is gay. 

For example: If I'm dating a trans girl: it's wlw which = gay. If I'm dating a trans guy: I identify as part dude and use he/him pronouns so it's basically mlm = gay. If I'm dating an enby we are definitely going to be gay af together😁. This all applies to cis people too.

Ultimately it's up to the people in the relationship to choose how to describe their relationship and to make sure both parties feel comfortable and validated with whatever label(s) they choose to use or to not use. Sounds like your partner was uncompromising about this issue and it's perfectly fine for that to be a deal breaker. Some of us just view it differently so if I were to use the term gay to describe my relationship with a trans man, I wouldn't be doing it to invalidate him/ to imply I still saw him as a girl.

Small note I'd like to add too: if my hypothetical trans  man partner found it invalidating for me to call our relationship gay we would not only have to talk about how his identity was being invalidated, but also how his reaction can be rooted in his own prejudice towards me. (Just stay with me for a second) What I mean is we'd need to breakdown the fact that he doesn't find it appropriate/accurate for me to identify with the mlm community/use the word gay to describe out mlm-ish relationship even though I am genderfluid and identify with being a guy (kind of). Basically, there's layers to this stuff and it goes both ways.
Why would it be a you problem? If they are dating you and calling themselves a lesbian, then they are calling you a woman.. which is a them problem :/
You explained this better than I could. Thank you.
Ofc but there ARE improper uses of things, sexuality is 100% fluid but you cannot be homosexual, then have “exceptions”
I’d like to say, you can be a woman and be non-binary tho. just like trans men can be non-binary or trans women can be non-binary . 

I don’t think that you have to force masc non-binary people to be lesbians, but there ARE masc non-binary people who are lesbians. It’s not our place to decide who identifies as what.

I’m curious your definition of ‘gay’ then ?? because historically there has been a lot of amab individuals who are trans femme who are gay, and from what I’ve seen the community generally accepts them more. but if a person is afab, trans masc and a lesbian - oh no it’s a crime

because it falls under the same double standards of - ‘oh that person can be a she/her gay, but that other person can’t be a he/him lesbian’
You’re free to disagree but there are a lot of non-binary lesbians who use the term in that way
Enbys are not women-light, so I can't imagine how they are included in the term any more than men.
[deleted]
Oh yes, I absolutely wouldn't mind dating someone who doesn't date cis men, I personally don't either but i still identify as bi to include trans men. I just wish they didn't use the label lesbian since is feels pretty invalidating to me personally, but a more specific label would definitely be welcome!
mm kinda understand what you say (lik I see it more like a t4t thing, like why would someone date a cis), as long as you consider yourself at least bisexual (liking trans men is liking men, they're not less men than the cis ones) I think it's okay, excluding cises because you don't have the same experiences as them it's something normal and makes a lot of sense. the problem would be saying you're a lesbian bc of that (lesbian would include nb people and transmasc lesbians but NOT trans guys).
Didn't say you were? I was talking generally

ETA: I do think you can be transphobic without being cis though. It's pretty common for people in the trans community to believe trans women are real women, and trans men... Well, they're *trans* men.
Yikes. I am sorry you are going through that. My opinion is probably based on an experience I saw between my friend and their ex. He transitioned and his ex said that it is okay essentially because they still have the same genitalia and completely disregarded that my friend identifies as a trans man. It was definitely invalidating for my friend, that's for sure.


 I don't know. I'm a grey pan, so I could definitely be missing something. 


I hope things get better for you and that you keep following the path that allows you to be true to yourself.
Trans masc / trans fem is usually about identity rather than presentation, I think. Maybe if you label yourself according to your presentation then that makes sense. Honestly the terms trans masc / trans fem can be confusing for this reason.
I woudn't say so because her identity is a trans woman, so she would be female, but gender non-conforming.   
A trans man who likes wearing feminine things isn't trans femme, he's feminine, the difference is identity vs. presentation.
butch =/= transmasc though
I think you could, and pretty much fits perfectly to my example of an exeption.
That's more so with the problem of using transmasc/fem as an umbrella term, because not all trans men are masculine and not all trans women are feminine. 
People say transmasc/fem to mean ""something something feminine/masculine spectrum"" but it ignores gnc people who arent traditionally masc or fem, but still male or female. 

So while you're right in getting confused, transmasc usually means ""afab trans person transitioning socially and/or medically to a more male appearance""
Great example.
Those orientations have nothing to do with gender though? So they can't exlude any? It has no relation what so ever to our current topic?
I see your point in a sense, but labels do have a general meaning as to what they apply to or they wouldn't be labels. And you can make labels too, and in this case that would probably be a good solution. 

And yes I can in fact say you can't use X because it doesn't correlate to the label, and because it actively harms another minority. And I can take it personally me being apart of that minority. 

The lesbian label exludes men spesifically, and saying you're a lesbian when you're attracted to trans men or even an indivual trans man, especially if you're in a relationship with them, is transphobic. And gives yet another chance for bigots to harm us, and give innocent people are wrongful idea of the label itself, as well as transmen as a whole.
 I really appreciate your willingness to correct and apologize!  I personally am mostly ok with that word (but I do have some pretty homophobic family who use it) , but I know it can be triggering for lots of people.
Obviously I'm not going to interrogate people! But if someone identifies as a lesbian and goes up to a trans MAN and asks him out, that's invalidating to the man. Yeah she may be physically attracted to his afab traits , but if she is sexually attracted to male traits, lesbian may not be correct, and if she is treating a trans man as his agab, female, he is being invalidated. 
There are always cases of romance where there is deviation from the bounds of a term due to a partner transitioning and the other partner still feeling love for the person, but that is not a reason to  reduce a trans person to their genitals and not respect their gender.  Tldr: love is flexible, but we have words to describe what traits our bodies react to, and even if your body reacts to a person's natal genitals, it's not ok to follow up on that and invalidate their gender.
While I appreciate the attempt to defend me, my partner met me when I was still presenting female and didn’t even realize I might be trans. 

We began dating while I was still identifying as female. To them, when we began dating, I was their girlfriend, and I’m okay with that. 

That doesn’t invalidate me now, and they has never, not once since I began exploring my gender identity, seen me as anything other than a man. 

They are the most supportive, accepting person I’ve ever known, and transphobic is the absolute last thing I would ever call them. 

I think this interaction shows a huge problem within our community. We always want to jump to someone else’s defense without bothering to dig deeper or to find out if the person we’re defending even wants or needs it. 

I get that we are a marginalized community, but we’re alienating our own by invalidating each other’s desires and needs. 

My relationship is as unique as my identity. Your post was a request to help you be more inclusive and validating if there was a need for it, yet you came into your comments to attack a true ally and to invalidate my own experiences without ever stopping to think. 

Please do better. We have enough enemies from outside the community without tearing down our own and those who support us.

***Edited because I previously used “husband” which is not an accurate representation of our relationship dynamic. Because they are NB, we use husband, wife, and partner interchangeably, but partner is the most accurate to our overall situation.
If definitions can be used to mean anything, it makes them redundant. 

Fact is, a man can never be a lesbian. Wlw explicitly excludes men. Can't believe anyone would disagree with that.
People who are lesbian are attracted to women, and women only. That is THE literal definition of a lesbian.

I’m not saying trans women aren’t women-I’m trans myself. I was just confused about the labeling they used, I’m sorry if I said something offensive I really didn’t mean it but yeah fuck terfs
Cringe
All for bi lesbians, but men being lesbians? Isn't that like trans girls identifying with gay men?
you understand that you’re fucking stupid right? stop drinking the koolaid and just love who you love dude
>there's been a terf-adjacent movement in modern history to make it mean exclusively loving women

could you please give a source for there being an actual deliberate ""terf-adjacent movement"" to change the meaning of the word lesbian, rather than just.... natural changing of a word's meaning over time?
I think maybe the term sapphic encapsulates what you’re talking about.
The term lesbian originated in the 1800s, not Ancient Greece, so you may want to update your copy pasta.
[deleted]
That’s fair!
Well, you can be ace and not aro. I’m sure there are people who are _romantically_ attracted to all genders but not _sexually_. There’s def a difference between who you want to fuck and who you want to date, hence ace (but not aro) bisexual. But it’s my understanding that lesbians are attracted to women and bisexuals are attracted to men and women and nb ppl and the terms are mutually exclusive. Lesbians don’t want to fuck men and bisexuals do. Idk I’m not gonna tell anyone how to describe their sexuality I just don’t understand how someone can be bi and lesbian…like I said you can’t be gay and straight or cis and trans, they’re mutually exclusive.
“Become trans” 🚩

Trans men cannot be lesbians. I cannot believe I have to say that and it’s unbelievably transphobic to think so
No, in Sappho's era, Lesbian meant ""someone living in Lesbos""
Gay heterosexual
Ace doesn’t exclude an orientation. Ace is a status of how sexual attraction is felt or not felt. Who you can be attracted to isn’t exclusive to whether or not you don’t feel sexual attraction.
[deleted]
That’s different tho
i appreciate your feedback and pov. we all have our views in these things so it's good to talk abt these things
That's what I generally define sexuality as too. I think the whole of this comment section is the community not knowing how to define it. For me I'd say sexuality is gender preference and people can have genital preferences, but that shouldn't be how they define their sexuality because it could invalidate their partner.
My use of non-binary men refers to non-binary people who also identify with manhood; this could mean your examples, yes, and beyond that. I just mean any non-binary person who self identifies as partially a man as well, I hope that makes sense. I'm never ever ascribing this label to a person because of AGAB or presentation, it's entirely up to each individual. 

My attraction as a lesbian is as a bigender non-binary person who loves any queer person who isn't exclusively a man. I love in a queer way, and in a sapphic way, so it's the best term for me.
oh. I get that I have seen it on Tiktok but really mostly in the context of afab nbs dating cishet  men.  I always viewed it as a cheeky way to cope with gross straight men not viewing you as anything other than women to be frank.


I also think it's situation dependent and as my ex was very masc, nearly always used he/him, was not very GNC, and largely swung in MLM circles it did not feel like he was describing it in the way you are.  .


I think you articulated this well and have a fair point but I also think nb folk can't just use ""Im nb and thus it's always gay"" as some trump card to use gay always, I wouldn't use lesbian to describe our amab mtf+amab nb relationship, it's reasonable to ask he/they not use gay.  IMO. in your equivalent trans man scenario it would be more like a lesbian using the term to describe a relationship with you, whether or not you'd find that uncomfortable.


tl;dr the word y'all are looking for is queer.
As a lot of other commenters have mentioned, some people who use the lesbian label define it as not being attracted to binary men. Dictating other people’s identities is gatekeepy as hell, so I’m not here to tell them their label is wrong. They know what’s in their own heart better than I ever will.
No, they’re not. I call myself a gay man because I basically am, but every now and then I come across a woman that I find just as attractive as I find other men. That doesn’t mean I think she’s a man- she’s just an exception
There are a decent number of non-binary lesbians so being with a lesbian or being a lesbian doesn’t automatically mean “woman”. It’s non men being attracted to non men
But. They aren't calling them a women. 

They're calling themselves a lesbian.
You do realize like ….being fem doesn’t immediately mean trans-fem…
Also lesbian is a WOMAN who likes women
I do respect that, I just really dont understand it.
Sorry if i sound ignorant but what if two people like eachother but one is not comfortable dating a lesbian as the label makes them personally uncofortable? Is their discomfort invalid in that case?
[removed]
Totally agree with you. CiMET for Cisgender Man Exclusionary Transgender ? Oh hell it sounds so terfy 😄
Well if someday i fall in love with a guy, of course i won’t say I’m a lesbian. I mean where would be the logic doing this 🤷🏻‍♀️ though so far it didn’t happen and my preference is still going to femininity, even if doors aren’t closed
Perhaps you can help me parse this, because I'm thoroughly confused. I'm clearly mixed up somewhere, but I'm not sure where.

I think of presentation as an outward expression, and to me it's quite similar to style, fashion, or aesthetic. So, for example, I'm a closeted trans woman so most commonly (outside of the house) I present as a man. My clothes, mannerisms, speech patterns, etc. are all essentially window dressing, where my gender is quite a bit more feminine than my typical presentation.

So where I think I get tripped up is that I see gender as being a circle that encompasses an area over the masculine - feminine spectrum, and I see those circles overlapping. So what I mean by that is that one's gender identity is in a place on the feminine - masculine spectrum and could easily be categorized as one (or more) of multiple genders.

So I would say that, and presuming that their gender identity is accurately reflected in their gender expression, I would consider Michelle Rodriguez to be more masculine than Michale Cera. I see them as their gender identity existing (again, given the before presumption) in that overlap area.

But as a thought experiment, let's pretend a universe where nothing else changes but their natal gender, making them both trans. Michelle is now amab, but still a girl and has the same gender identity/presentation, and Michael Cera is now afab at birth with everything else the same.

So in that make-believe universe, and not to imply that she's butch, Michelle Rodriguez is a trans woman but saying she's trans feminine feels off.

(And of course I don't claim to know any of their's gender, natal gender, what anatomy they were born with, yada yada yada. Also, i'm only working off of their roles as actors, and haven't seen but 3 movies in the past decade so my conception of them is quite dated. So like, resident evil + super bad if that helps. I'm just looking for something a bit more concrete to make conversation easier)
It does sometimes, there are some transmasc butches as well as cis butches.

Edit: y'all I'm not saying that transmasc folks are equal to butches, that would be absurd and transphobic. I'm saying that SOME transmasc folks are butch and identify with that label, and it's important to remember that they exist since they are so often erased.
I don't think you understand it. Ace and aro people have to deal with the same issue that op is describing, where the partner can feel invalidated by the label used. There are multiple forms of attraction, so someone could still be attracted to a person without that person aligning with the label they use.
It doesn't harm anyone if you make a personal usage of a label. Nothing compels you to force other people in your definitions of labels. You can be a lesbian in a heterosexual relationship because your relationship statut doesn't define your orientation. Such as, when you are a bi person in a heterosexual relationship, you stay a bi person.
 Relationships ≠ orientation, and that works for any orientation and kind of relationship. Or do you mean it works for *some* orientations and *some* relationships but not all? Wouldn't that be hypocritical? Or maybe, big revelation, your personal views on how relationships should define orientations only concerns you?
 As an example that might be less controversial for you: asexuality. Asexuality is a spectrum, meaning that some asexual people will have sexual relations, and even enjoy it, while some will not. However, they are all asexual, and valid as such, because *they* know they are, while other people are not able to tell that just be observing their behaviour. Same with every other label. 
  Of you want, orientation is such a personal feeling that no word will ever be perfect to encompass all of it. We have to settle on some words to understand each other, but it will always mean something at leat a little bit different for everyone, as everyone's sensibility and experience they link to this label is different. What I put behind the labels I use is very personal and only works for me because my experience as a human being is mine and mine only, and no one will ever be able to understand the depth of my whole experience, making them unable to understand a label the way I do, at least never fully.
Ah shit I’m so sorry about your family <3 my dms are open if you ever need to vent
I'm not even sure you know what point you're trying to make.
I love you so much.

Lesbians are non-men loving non-men, the intersection of gender-queer folks and lesbians has been a huge part of lesbian culture for centuries. 

Recently, a lot of TERFs have lead to a sudden enforcement of cis-women-only lesbian spaces, but those are NOT the majority of lesbian circles - and the definition of lesbian rejects this ideology as well, trans lesbians in any shape or form (weather binary or not) have always and will continue to be welcome. 

We've had transmasc and non-binary lesbians for most of time - I highly recommend you look more into lesbian history to help understand the importance of trans and non-binary presence as lesbians. 

I know that the assertion that lesbians are only women loving women has been very prominent in the past few decades, so I understand why that would be your impression, but it's incorrect and is a definition asserted on us often by transphobic cis straight women who are trying to erase trans people from women's spaces in some strange twisted version of exclusionary feminism.
That is not the definition for lesbian, nor has it ever been. And unless if you are a lesbian, it's not up to you to decide the definition. As it is currently, in the majority of inclusive lesbian spaces, lesbians include trans women and some non-binary people, if they identify with it. Often this is because a part of them is a woman, i.e. bigender non-binary folks such as myself.

Why is that a red flag? Some trans people experience always being trans, but most of the trans ppl I know myself included became trans later in life.

And yes, trans men can be whatever they want. Gatekeeping identities of trans people is what's transphobic.

Wouldn't that be panromantic then?
she didn't specify if it was homosexual or homoromantic though
That's... That's the point...
I think so too! And I appreciate yours. I personally super enjoy conversing about deep topics, and don't get the chance to as often as I would like. :)
Yes exactly! Same goes for fashion & body type.
Ahhhh~! Okay! That makes sense. And again, I think that would fall under Lesbianism in the same way that Homosexuality as a whole can be defined as ""being attracted to similarly aligned and same aligned genders""! Causs it is exclusively Not-Men-Only identity in which you're attracted too!
>it would be more like a lesbian using the term to describe a relationship with you, whether or not you'd find that uncomfortable.

I wouldn't find them identifying as a lesbian uncomfortable for me. It's more like, would I be able to find someone who identified as a lesbian, wanted to date me, and would also use he/him pronouns and masculine words to talk about me? To be totally fair, I don't believe that's likely, but if such a person existed, I'd be fine with their label. That's still just me though and I'm sure other people in my position would have different views.

>tl;dr the word y'all are looking for is queer.

Yes and no. Would queer fit these scenarios? Yes. Is it therefore incorrect to use gay for these scenarios? No. It really is just up to the people in a relationship to dictate what terms are comfortable for them to refer to their relationship as. I'm comfortable calling my relationships gay because for me gay is a broad term. I get your point, using queer is more ambiguous/ less likely to be misunderstood, but I don't think it's wrong to use gay if someone is more comfortable with it (given that all parties in the relationship agree to it).
Like you said,
>it's situation dependent

I honestly think that's the underlying conclusion
You're bi my dude ;)

And the lesbian with a trans-masc BF is also bi, unless they are choosing to believe their partner is a butch-lesbian instead of a guy which is pretty scummy!
That…that means you are bi or pan or Omni…
:( what about us non-binary lesbians?
If it isn’t your identity then you don’t have to understand it, you know? Please don’t speak for masc enby’s if it isn’t your place
That sounds more like a compatibility issue. You discomfort is a you problem but it should generally feel good to date someone. If you won’t/can’t work through that you shouldn’t date someone you would resent being with.
Because throwing around the r-slur is a great way to make people feel that you're sound of mind.

I think it sounds terfy because of the implication that you can tell. It sounds like (not saying it is) an assumption that - as GCs put it - you “always know” whether a guy is cis or trans. If you accept that you won’t always know, it’s difficult to say you’d never be attracted to a cis guy.   
Or, perhaps more importantly, it sounds like maybe you think a trans guy is “different” from a cis guy on a fundamental level (other than basic biology), which again is a GC talking point ie that a trans man is not “really” a man, they are a third gender of some kind. Out of interest, what is it about cis guys that you don’t like, that you think is ok about trans guys? If it’s genital preference then I think that’s absolutely fine (and would obv also exclude some trans girls) but otherwise I wonder if there is some internalised prejudice that makes you think trans men are in some way “different”.
It's ok, I appreciate the offer though. I've cut those family members out of my life and it's been probably 7 years since I've seen any of them!
My point is dont be like ""lol I am exclusively attracted to women! But you, trans guy, I am attracted to you!""  Because trans men are men and should be respected!
You don't need to identify with a label to still interact with that community who does identify with that label.
Absolutely not. It’s NOT about feminism. It’s about common sense. A lesbian is a woman who loves another woman. This is just ridiculous at this point. I don’t care if they’re cis or not. I trans female IS a female. They have the absolute right to call themselves a lesbian, as they are female.
I said a lesbian is a female who is interested in other females. Trans females are included??? Like idk why you mentioned that in your statement, as that heavily implies you do not see trans women as real women.
Your argument relies entirely on the idea that trans women aren’t women though, lesbians are women who like women, trans women are women, therefore lesbians can be trans women and lesbians can be attracted to trans women. The main thing that spectated terf ideology from that of a non-bigot is hatefulness and prejudice, it’s not transphobic just because you’ve heard transphobes say it. It’s a perfectly reasonable assertion, and like any reasonable assertion can be twisted by the dumb/hateful.
You spreading disinformation
It also doesn't take that much common sense to know that the label lesbian conflicts with the bi label.

The erasure is twofold and you go from saying this is backed by history to ""I actually don't know, it doesn't matter"", even though your trying to enlighten us all.
That’s fair. If someone said they were ace biromantic or ace bisexual I think I would understand what they’re talking about either way. Regardless, that only further deepens my confusion over “bisexual lesbians”. Biromantic lesbians, sure, but I’m still not understanding bisexual lesbian, unless maybe you’re a person who is sexually attracted to both genders but romantically only women? Like bisexual, femromantic, if that’s a thing? Idk like I said I’m not trying to be offensive just confused is all.
Being bigender doesn’t make you cis and trans at the same time.
Ur very rude lol
If you became trans you're genderfluid
cis itf
Yeah, that person was silly
Asexual and aromantic aren’t exclusive
OHH 💀💀 LMAOO IM SORRY 🧍
Exactly! That's how I see it for myself. 

Labels are very personal and individual, and there's no one right or wrong way to be gay, lesbian, queer, etc. Unless if someone is being blatantly transphobic, ofc, I do really feel for the trans men who have had awful experiences with lesbian TERFs trying to defend their transphobic attraction.
No, I’m not. How dare you try and dictate my sexuality to me? As a rule, I don’t see myself with a woman. I don’t think being able to see myself with a grand total of less than 5 women in my life is enough to redefine my sexuality. 

People don’t have to redefine their entire identity just because they happened to fall in love with one person that they “shouldn’t” according to their sexuality.
Yep i used to identify as a gay man until i realised im a bi man who just HEAVILY leans towards gay, then i realised im a bi woman (but now i heavily lean towards straight i guess) if you can find both genders sexually attractive yhen youre some flavour of bisexual or pansexual, if its just a romantic thing then you coukd always be homosexual biromatic?
No it doesn’t. Who are you to dictate my sexuality to me? I don’t think finding a woman once in a blue moon attractive makes me anything at all- it’s called exceptions. As a rule, I don’t see myself with a woman.
Isn’t that trixic?
Excuse me? I wasn't speaking for anyone but myself. I guessed how I would feel, I stated it is my opinion... never once did I proclaim any form of universal truth. I get that in these circles, we are often fighting hard to defend and define our identity. 

I don't want to invalidate anyone, but also I struggle myself sometimes. To me, being able to call myself Lesbian is hugely affirming. It is a key part of who I am, and when I am told, as I often get told now, that the definition I knew of the word includes masc people who are not women, it is tough for me to process. It hits at a core of my identity, and I have to try and resist the knee jerk response to gatekeep.

I have always known lesbian to mean women loving women. I do get that enby people have preferences in gender as well, and so they cross circles, it is kind of built into an identity outside of the binary that binary identities become muddled and complex.

So I do struggle with it. I don't know how well I fit in a community, one that I will add is not always the most inviting in the first place to people like me, anymore, because what I grew up understanding, what I have been a part of for so long, is being transformed at its core. This isn't a situation of more being tacked on, or nuance shifting. This is the core nature of Lesbians being reshaped. 

I am allowed to be confused. I am allowed to voice that confusion, and I am even allowed to not like it. So please, don't tell me what is my place or not. You are stepping into a circle which I am a part of, and asking me to accept a massive culture shift. I am allowed to say something. I am allowed to voice my concerns, my confusions.

There's a lot fundimentally different between trans and cis men in terms of life experience at least. As a trans guy myself, though i can find any gender attractive, I will only ever date other trans people as I feel like they are the only people who I feel can truly understand me and my stuggles.

Ofc that doesn't mean I don't find cis people attractive since I can't ever 'tell' who is trans or not, I just choose not to date them.
Oh yeah. I was waiting for that reverse comment slap. Not genital preference, i date trans girls more than cis girls. My partner is a transfem enby like me. The answer to your question is, well i already wrote it. The journey. That is the difference, and i said i would first need to know him from before even thinking about anything romantic to feel a bond and start feeling something. Because of the journey. That is the difference. Plus, i hate that «bro manly man» shitty way of thinking cis men have been educated with, and i know something about it, believe me. Masculinism, misogyny, are not things that make me fall for someone and all the cis men in my life were made of it, while i never met any trans guy like this. What’s so different between trans guys and cis guys you ask? Trans guys are rarely violent, rapists, gaslighters. But i guess it was easier to believe i was full of transphobia myself, right ?..
Yeah imo it sounds TERFy because it *is* TERFy. Or TERTy? (Transfem exclusive radical transphobe)
Ah I’m glad <3 sending lots of love & good vibes homie!
I don't even think it's accurate to say that the definition of a lesbian is ""someone who is exclusively attracted to women."" Most homosexual people I know have had some amount of heterosexual experiences. Also, you yourself had to allow that my partner is not necessarily a lesbian, so clearly there's a lot of gray area. Maybe it's best to not just idly sit on Reddit and assume you can define what the term ""lesbian"" means to the millions and millions of lesbians that exist in the world. Which, again, is my whole point. Assuming you can define other people based on your own standards is a bigoted frame of mine, no matter who holds it.
Sure, but going to lesbian bars and community events and stuff kind of has the prerequisite that you're a lesbian. And the bottom line is, if someone feels it's who they are, are you really going to tell them to go fuck themself, and that you understand their identity better than they do?
Apologies for the wrong assumption about your intent, most people who use the word female to describe women are either incels or TERFs who are trying to exclude people based off of AGAB. 

But by insisting that only binary women can be lesbians, you are actively excluding trans non-binary people and women from being lesbians. I am sorry, but it does seem as if you are willing to engage in education and understand from a point of compassion and curiosity, so I will not be engaging with you further because you seem very young and stuck in TERF rhetoric about lesbians. 

Your one incorrect outsider opinion does not change the reality of lesbian spaces. They have always been inclusive of all women of all gender identities.
If you are born female and identify as male and female... How are you not simultaneously trans and cis?

mtf transphobic
What
No problem lol
Yes, and I think that's where the biggest issue of it all comes into play. Between the Transphobia and Bi/Pan/Omniphobia, it gets really rough for people out her sometimes, and it especially hurts when if comes from within the community. 

Having these discussions is the most important thing, and it opens up the discussion for more nich sexualities to talk and explain things as well, while also making sure people can define what could cross the line for some. Safe spaces for everyone!
I mean we are literally talking about our identities, it’s how you define yourself. You’re perfectly valid being a gay man, I don’t find myself as attracted to some people as others and I don’t think gender comes into it much so I’m pansexual. My wife feels very different attraction to men and woman so she’s bisexual.
Because sexuality isn’t something you choose mate, it’s a scientific thing. You are not exclusively homosexual, bi sexual can be 1% liking the same sex, it still bisexual. 

And to everyone downvoting, science is science, you can’t just “ choose” your sexuality
Some of us use that word, yes, but I'm not exclusively attracted to women and femininity so it's not something I identify with. 

I love folks who aren't exclusively men in a very sapphic way, and that's how I experience lesbian attraction.
As soon as someone starts throwing slurs around, I immediately stop listening to their opinion on anyone else's self-identity.
It is possible. There's a difference between sexual and romantic preferences. Someone could be a lesbian in dating women but also like having sex with men, which is homoromantic bisexual. Or the other way around with dating both and having sex with women, biromantic homosexual. So yes, it is possible.
Yeah, I get what you’re saying, I just feel like we might be on dangerous ground when we accept for example the GC assumption that trans (primarily) women don’t “count” because they have been “socialised as men” or have a different lived experience to some cisgender women. The differences in lived experience between, say, super-rich women vs women who have lived on the poverty line is probably greater than the difference between men and women in each group, so I just wonder if we are creating a division that doesn’t necessarily need to be defined? Honestly not saying I’m right, just that it makes me a bit uncomfortable.
>There's a lot fundimentally different between trans and cis men in terms of life experience at least.

That may be true for you but certainly isn't universal.
Right back at ya! ♡
No and yes, I would consider myself to have a better and more accurate understanding of the label itself and who it applies to, as well as having the right to represent my minorities collective values as a trans man myself,  and informing the indivual of the harmful impact using that label incorrectly is and how it hurts me personally. 

Again, you don't NEED to be a lesbian to go to such event and participate in those communities, especialky if you already had a tight bond in those communities I would imagine they accept you with open arms. And do in subreddits as well. I'm still in the egg_irl community even though I've fully realized my gender and the community happily accepts me.
💀
Because cis isn’t defined by identifying with your agab. It’s defined by identifying with *only* your agab as it was given to you. Bigender people are not half cis anymore than bisexual people are half straight.
1) you’re not stating “facts” just your interpretation of the matter, 2) you can state facts _and_ still be an asshole, and 3) you’re not even addressing anything I said. I specifically talked about sexual vs romantic interest. Being bisexual is *not* being gay and straight. I have a bisexual wife who has been told that and takes great offense to that. She’s not half gay and half straight, she’s 100% bisexual, ya dingus.
And trans is when your gender DOESN'T change
That definitely exists lmao, my turn.   

Non binary girl.
Exactly, thank you. I just don’t think my very rare attraction to women is a notable part of my identity at all. I can count on one hand with a couple of fingers missing the number of women I’ve met and could genuinely see myself with. Maybe there’ll be more in the future, I don’t know and I’m open to it, but I’m gay
Huh that’s…hmmmm
[removed]
I can definitely see how that could be taken to some unpleasant places. For me personally it's not about sexual attraction (in that regard i am bisexual). My very strong prefrence for trans people is more emotional, since the way things are right now, I only feel truly safe and loved around them.
I suppose so but i find that dating someone I know understands what being trans is like rather than just being accepting is a lot more desirable to me, and that sort of understaning is something i could never get from any cis person.
Okay. Duly noted. 

By your logic, lesbians are unable to be attracted to nonbinary people. Because being a lesbian means only being attracted to women. And nonbinary people are not women, that's a transphobic idea that is erasing of androgynous identities.
This is splitting hairs over a common statement people make when talking about gender and transition. Saying “I became trans” isn’t accurate but it conveys a message that is easily understood and can carry the meaning intended.
Lmao WHAT.
Straight lesbian boy
I'm a non-binary transmasc lesbian and I'm a bit nervous to comment in this whole thread, because I am also attracted to some men (cis or trans.) Men who express themselves in femme ways are wonderful to me, and non-binary men especially are attractive, regardless of presentation - I do make my lesbian identity known to any partner, because I wouldn't want any man to be invalidated by my identity. 

My lesbian identity means that I'm attracted to people who aren't binary men, but even then there's a few GNC binary men who I have been attracted to and would date.
Okay, totally get your stance of how you feel about your sexuality. In many ways I refer to myself as gay, even though I'm actually demipansexual, and honestly could just fall more under being Queer in my sexuality.

I think more of what people are trying to point out is that a lot of people will have similar opinions and use this in a harmful way towards those who are Bi/Pan/Omni. 

A lot of people tend to forget that you don't have to have a strictly 50/50 attraction to binary men and women. You can be 99.99% attracted to one gender, and have a 0.01% attraction to another, and you can still be Bi/Pan/Omni. 

Because of this, I think this is why people are bringing this up, because there are a lot of individuals who have felt pressured to be strictly Straight or strictly Gay. There is a surprisingly amount of Bi, Pan, and Omniphobia, even in the Queer community itself. 

Your choice in label is something that is completely valid, but I also think it is an important thing to discuss with your partner(s), in order to determine what is right for you and your partner, especially when it comes to those who are trans and may have issues with it. That way you're all on the same page! Communicate is key to any relationship after all~!
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have to help educate with compassion! My DMs are open if you're worried about asking something that could be considered uninformed or ignorant. 

I also highly recommend you check out r/butchlesbians and r/nonbinarylesbians to hear more about transmasc, non-binary, and cis GNC lesbian experiences!
The irony of you calling some of us 'dick cutters' and throwing around slurs while posting ""Be kind to others""  https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/tg8lrx/what_should_i_say_when_i_dont_believe_in_my/i10f1xz
I asked for an open and civil discussion, not for a bunch of kids to start throwing around insults just cause they don't agree with someone :/
As a ""r....."", I can assure you this is not ""r.....ed"" because most of us don't think that.

I mean, I'd have to poll the group but people with my flavor of ""r.....ation"" tend to take things very literally so lesbian means lesbian. To suggest otherwise implies lesbians can be ""converted"" by the right guy. Which is shitty.

Edit: reddit does not like asterisks.
Yes, fair enough. I don’t have a well formed view on this tbh and as you say, it’s how unpleasant people would interpret it that perhaps raised a flag for me. I can just imagine a GC picking up this thread and saying “see! Even trans people don’t think they are the same” which I know is not what you’re saying. But then GCs will twist everything so perhaps that’s not the greatest benchmark!
I love the way you think
I think there's a huge difference between being T4T and being someone who'll date anyone but a cis man. 

T4T person is interested in me and wouldn't date a cis man? Very cool, shared experiences and all that. 

Someone who'd date cis women but not cis men is interested in me? That feels icky.
No, that is not what it means. I also find it odd that you’ve claimed every person you’ve argued with in this thread is transphobic at one point or another.
Aroace het
I’m not going to pretend I understand exactly how being a transmasc lesbian works but equally I’m not going to tell you you’re wrong like some other arseholes here have done to me. It’s disgusting that other queer people (especially fellow trans people) can come in and start telling people who they are. Next they’ll be telling me I’m not really a man unless I have phalloplasty!
Hey you’re valid as hell. My personal hang ups on a word are NOT YOUR FAULT and you have every right to be yourself without fear
Well, maybe a better label you can use for general public is Queer! Since you are queer, no matter how you roll it c: 

Your choice in the more specific of labels are yours to have and know, and no one else has to know what those labels are other than those who you want to know (like say your partner!) That is an important discussion to have, and anyone else doesn't matter than.
Of course it doesn’t have to be 50/50, but I don’t identify with that because I don’t see myself ending up with anyone other than a man.

It’s not that people are bringing it up- they’re telling me what I am and that’s not on. They’re not suggesting, they’re dictating, as if I haven’t spent many years mulling it over myself. It’s ignorant, it’s disrespectful, and I don’t tolerate it.

I’ve tried various labels and up to now have identified as bi for longer than I have as gay. As I understood my gender better, I understood my sexuality better too. Once upon a time I thought I was a lesbian!

Being trans, I am very much sick to the back teeth of people telling me what I am and am not. Very hurtful and disappointing when it comes from members of your own community- you don’t expect it here.

Your identity is yours- not your partners. Hopefully you have a relationship where your partner doesn’t feel that your identity invalidates theirs and viceversa. If not, there’s some work to do. I’ve been with straight guys who totally didn’t see me as a guy- I understand what it feels like. You just have to make sure you have a partner that you trust respects your identity- that’s all that matters in the end
I haven't called anyone transphobic in this thread. You are talking out your ass. 

I didn't even say you were transphobic. You got mad and assumed that yourself.

I said a lesbian who was attracted to nonbinary people would hypothetically be transphobic because nonbinary people aren't women.
The easiest way a lot of folks understand it is to look more into butch culture. There's a lot of transmasc butches alongside cis butches, and that can extend to other gender presentations as well. Generally, I consider myself to be bigender, so I'm both a man and a woman and I love in a queer way so I prefer to keep the lesbian label because it's the most accurate descriptor of how I love. 

Thank you, labels are very personal and I've had to fight to keep this lesbian one in a way that others deem valid. But honestly, I just know it's right for me, so sometimes I can forget about what other folks think and be happy and certain with my identity. It took a lot to get here, lol. You know how that is.
Some of us don't like to use the label queer. It makes me deeply uncomfortable because it was used a slur for me in my youth.
Some of us don't like to use the label queer. It makes me deeply uncomfortable because it was used a slur for me in my youth.
I appreciate your sentiment, but I am a lesbian. Im also queer, but I love in a sapphic way. I also make sure to let any potential partner know that, so if being with a lesbian would make them feel invalidated (which makes sense for some folks) they can know that we're not compatible and make that choice.
I can understand this, as a trans man myself. Again, I think people are saying that it sounds like being bi/pan/omni to them, and that they are confused by it. 

It is annoying, very much so, that it they are telling you what your label should be: your Anger is valid. I would like to hope that they are not trying to be malicious about it though. Just concerned because of the issues of TERFS being within the LBGTQ+ Community (I'm certain you have dealt with the issue of the LGB Drop the T group). 

I think that's just where people are worried. They most certainly could and should have said it in a nicer way, or in a more open minded way, instead of dictating your sexuality for you. Just remember people likely don't know how much time you've had to think about things, and that they may be trying to be helpful for those who are closeted (even if what they say really doesn't help and just ends up being annoying).

And Yes, your identity is yours: but that also means your partner's identity is there. I think we both understand that, and understand the importance of discussing that prior to starting a relationship. 

For me, I personally can't date someone who insists on identify as straight or lesbian, even though they're dating me: because I've done that, and it ended up being very distressing, especially since the person I was dating kept trying to challenge my trans identity. I just don't want to deal with that grief and trauma, and honestly, it makes me hesitant to even date anyone who is cisgender because of that trauma. 

And you are completely right about having a partner who you can trust. Hence why is it so important to discuss with a person prior hand, and why it is okay to not continue a relationship if those ideas clash with one another. Not every relationship is going to work out. It just is also important to make an effort to talk about these things and work through them, especially in the case where someone comes out as trans during the middle of an already pre-established relationship.  Compromising where one can, and accepting when a compromise can't be made, and also accepting no one is the villian for being honest and true to themself: these are all things that are signs of a healthy and mature relationship.
You called other people’s ideas transphobic. Same difference. Also non-binary people can definitely be women.

And it is you, sir, who are mad. HOOOHAAH 🤺
Fair, it was just an idea though. For some it can be empowering to take back words that were once used in a negative fashion, or to take back current slurs. It's definitely not for everyone.
Not a problem! I just know you mentioned you were worried about it, and thought maybe just using queer in a public space would make you feel more comfortable and safe c: 

If Lesbian is what you are comfortable with, then that's what you're xomfortable with, and it is really good you talk to your partners about it before getting into things! Communication is Key, and if your partner doesn't care, then they don't care, and it doesn't matter. 

Just is a tricky of a topic, since it, well....has it's issues, and in the end, there probably isn't a good answer for a general answer. Especially with the issues that people face with discrimination both outside and inside the community.
> I think people are saying that it sounds like being bi/pan/omni to them, and that they are confused by it.

No, they're not- They're telling me that's what I am: 

""That…that means you are bi or pan or Omni…""

""You're bi my dude ;)""

>They most certainly could and should have said it in a nicer way

Said what? That they think they know who I am better than I do? 

>but that also means your partner's identity is there.

Of course, and it would be highly unreasonable for me to expect them to change how they identify on my account. If I were to have a partner say they're only attracted to women but I'm an exception and I trust they do see me as a man, I'm not going to expect them to suddenly identify as bi. It's only a problem when it feels like they don't see me as a man.

There is no compromising when it comes to identities so if your partner's identity makes you uncomfortable, then they're simply not the one for you. 

>especially in the case where someone comes out as trans during the middle of an already pre-established relationship.

This really is a difficult situation and I cannot imagine what it must be like for either party. In theory, nothing should change as the people are both still fundamentally themselves, but in practice it very much can change things.
They can be, they aren't inherently. My point still stands that it would be transphobic for lesbians to be attracted to nonbinary people, because nonbinary people are not inherently women. 

And no, I didn't. If I did please show me. 

I told one person they were inching into TERF rhetoric, and I also specified I didn't think they were transphobic. Just that terfs would use that opinion of 'lesbians only like women' to boost their own transphobia.
Okay, addressing the last bit because that's the only part I feel I can confidently express myself on it without getting aggravated myself. I don't want to make anyone angry, I'm just trying to make this a place where things can be explained non-aggressively and have some optimism over the shittiness of people. 

In practice, it very much changes things, and I have seen time and time and time again individuals who have come out to their partner, and their partner then deciding that it isn't a relationship they want to be in. I also see a lot of other trans folx who get very hurt and blame their partner for their attraction disappearing and their choice to leave that relationship. It sucks, but you can't change how people feel, and no one is to blame in those situations. I have also seen the reverse, where people have stayed with their partner, who still identifies as straight or lesbian or gay, which is then paired with the questioning and challenging of the trans folx's tranness. 

When it comes down to things, you have three options: potentially come to terms that the label you were once using might not encompass all that you thought yourself to be; decide that the labels don't matter and that all party members involved are unaffected by the labels; or choose to end the relationship because of a lack in compatibility. That's what I mean by ""Compromise"". 

Not only that, but the sad reality of things is that there are far too many people who fetishize things like being trans and take advantage of people and do some serious ass emotional harm. It is because of this fact and my own personal experience with things that I have found that I just can't hold the same sentiments as you, friend. I'm glad it works out for you, and again, I'm sorry that people have been shitty about how they spoke to you about your sexuality, but it most certainly has not worked out for me, and several others as well. It's why we are very, very cautious about such things, and why it is important for a majority of us to be cautious."	tg8jvq	trans	1013	0.95	2022-03-17 11:59:30
Came out to work last week and when I got to work this morning after my days off I found this. I was at a point where going stealth wasn’t much of an option anymore. I have had to relearn my job and Iwas having a hard time with Dysphoria. I’m so happy right now and needed to share this with someone.		"Omg this is so heartwarming to see! ❤️
I’m so glad your workplace is so accepting and I wish you love and happiness op
very cool!
Lucky! I come out a few months ago and I've been using the women's restroom and it's p clear that people aren't comfortable. I asked my old boss about it and he said there were 6 employees complaining and ""they need to get the fuck over it"" (his words) I think a neutral bathroom would be great. I don't feel comfortable sharing the room with men, but I'm sure the women I work with don't want to share their bathroom with a ""man"" and I get that... I'm really not trying to make anyone uncomfortable but I'm on spiro and here for 12 hours at a time. I need to pee!
i love everything about this
Now that's what I call having an influence!  😁🥰  Lilli~
That's a wonderful statement on their part. I'm glad you work someplace where you're being supported during what I assume is an incredibly challenging, stressful, and frightening time in your life
It brings so much joy when I see the Gender neutral sign! I can only imagine the pain our community goes through when we don't associate with the cisgender binary. I rarely see those I'm workplaces. Hope this brightened your week and got your weekend off to a good start.
I cried happy tears for the first time in a while.
So cool!!!
The other employees “oh shit oh shit we gotta make sure OP is safe! Fuck it, masking tape will work!”

Seriously though that’s so sweet.
Yay
Ender Neutra
Good for you . The problem is your work doesn’t have a choice because if they don’t embrace your transition  they are bigots and will get cancelled and loose everything they have . This is the problem with cancel culture it is ruining people free thought
Fuck yeah!  People are awesome when they aren't occupied with sucking!
It took me too long to figure out what this was talking about
Thank you so much, have to admit this was totally unexpected for me. I feel so happy
On top of coming out to my bosses at work I also came out to the people at HR. It wasn’t till I did that that these changes took place. Maybe that is something you could try.
Yeah so true
Totally has become a challenge and it was super scary coming out to work but thanks to all of he other posts I see up, it gave me courage
Totally brightened my weekend for sure. I hope you have an amazing weekend also.
I held my tears back for as long as I could
Lol 😂
Oh I'm out to HR. Tldr I came out to a former friend at work and he told a bunch of people and went to HR. There was a company wide sensitivity training that the company's lawyer came into teach. Very obviously because of me and that encounter. Fun meeting not at all awkward.
I'm weak so I couldn't.
Oh dang I mean that’s great they had a meeting but dang.
Yeah, the past couple of weeks have been wild. There's even a few people that I used to be on good terms with who won't even look at or talk to me since I've come out"	pm9fna	trans	1000	1.0	2021-09-11 15:28:57

You are killing it!
So pretty 😍 love your smile
You are Super Gorgeous🔥🔥💐💐💐
Nice colour lipstick 💄
You remind me of Stevie Nicks .😌Shes beautiful too
Thank you, I’ve gone green since I took this picture. Grey hair so hard to manage 😊
Thank you 😊💜🖤
I was grey last year and you’re definitely right about the upkeep. I just saw your green hair. I love it!
Aw man and I was thinkin about dyin mine grey. Idk it was between that and platinum blonde
It’s worth it when it works but it’s products on top of dyes on top of toners 😬
Thank you, always wanted to go green and have finally had the confidence 💜🖤
It’s great when it’s done properly. If your able go to a professional hair dresser that’s best as they’ll know best what will work with your hair. To get a grey/platinum colour your going to need max levels of lift from bleach, the right toner and purple shampoo.
Oh yeah I had my hair dyed platinum blonde before in preparation for pink dye and I loved the look of it. Honestly I shoulda kept it cause the pink was not the color it was supposed to be (bubble gum pink but it came out magenta)
That’s a shame it came out a different colour. Would pasteliser tone down the magenta to a lighter pink?
Maybe idk. All Ik is I got out the shower and it was the wrong color"	w1xif0	trans	985	0.99	2022-07-18 11:57:16
My kid told me she wants to be transgender.	"My kid is 10 and finishing up 5th grade. Will start middle school next year. She told her mom and I that she would like to transition over the summer. We are supportive of all of it and have told her so since she was two when she would say she wished she were a boy. 
My biggest concern right now is I want to make sure she is doing this because it is what she wants versus because it is a thing with her friend group right now. One of her best friends has come out as pansexual. Her other friends have spent the better part of a year discussing gender identity. I just want to be sure that she is feeling this way because of who she truly is and not because of peer pressure. 
My wife is a psychologist and I asked her if she thinks therapy with a child psychologist who specializes in gender identity would be beneficial. My wife and I want our kid to be happy and feel comfortable in their skin and with who they are. 
Does anyone in this community have any words of wisdom or advice they would like to share? Anything is appreciated. Thank you for time."	"Good on you for listening to your kid. If they’ve been saying they are/wish they were a boy from 2-10, even if intermittently, sounds like not a fad/peer pressure thing. Have you asked them if they’d like to try out using he/him pronouns? In terms of a therapist, I would explain the benefits and emphasize that it’s totally confidential, and then if they’re interested let them help pick someone if possible - you don’t want to push them into a situation that makes them even less comfortable talking about it.
Your child is 10 so transition just entails social transition, so nothing permanent or even semi permanent.  Also  this has been going on for 8 years so I don't see how this is due to peer pressure
I would allow them to socially transition. Also if someone has expressed questioning or has state their gender identity, don't continue to misgender them.
Since she is 10 (saw the comment about her being ok with she/her) you can just start socially transitioning her. Seeing if she wants a hair cut, get new clothes, see if she wants to try other pronouns. You absolutely do not have to do any medical transitions until she is ready. 

I don't have much more advice but I am happy you are a supportive and good parent. A good amount of trans kids don't have that, good luck and lots of love to you and your family!
Who cares if it's what they really want or if it's because of influence? The kid is 10. Worst outcome is that they decide they don't like the social transition-which is all that will happen until they're much further into puberty and certain parts would have to wait until age 16 at least-and ends up sticking with their AGAB. The best thing that you're doing is supporting them *experimenting*, because plenty of people experiment with their gender and presentation, and being safely allowed to do that is going to give them a healthier relationship with gender in the future.
Queer kids find each other. My hs group was completely straight laced but in college 3/4 of us were some kind of trans. I don’t think it’s peer pressure, I think it’s gaydar
let her experiment. the best test is to let her try new hair, clothing, pronouns, and name, and see what makes her the happiest. Too young for permanent stuff, but if you start social transition now, by the time puberty blockers would come into question she should be reasonably confident in her gender identity. Maybe she's trans. Maybe not. Gendefluid is an option. It might be best not to let it bee too big of a deal, if you get what I mean. Let it be a natural part of self-discovery and creative expression.
Well you said it yourself that he wanted to be a boy at 2 before he even had any friends that could peer pressure him. Have a chat with your kid and talk about him socially transitioning. Nothing is permanent with that and later down the road if your child changes their mind then you could do that easily.
Listen to your kid. You have a son. Start now. Learn and grow. [Pflag](https://pflag.org) has good literature for supportive parents. [Trans bodies, trans selves](https://bookshop.org/books/trans-bodies-trans-selves-a-resource-by-and-for-transgender-communities/9780190092726) is a great book full of real information that can be trusted.

It’s not a trend. I was Ten when I told my parents I wanted to be a girl. They said verbatim “too bad. you’re not so get over it.” I repressed for 22 years because they were authoritarian parents. I nearly killed my self when I was 16 and how I made it to 32 without walking in front of a bus I’ll never know but my life was awful. I was dissociating, depersonalizing and derealizing. I’d been in so much emotional pain for decades hiding/repressing who I was. 

I’ve been in therapy once a week for 5 years. Started hrt 4.5 years ago. I’ve been happier than ever but I could have been this happy for 27 years instead. I’ve lost most of my entire life to a hellish nightmare that doesn’t even feel real now looking back.

Listen to your kid. They know more about themselves than you do. Even this early. Be better than my parents.
Everyone in the comments is already giving good advice, but I want to recommend r/CisParentTransKid !
Respect your child's identity. Social transition, even if it's temporary, is still important. Like when someone chooses to be called a nickname or to stop being called a nickname as they mature. And if your child hasn't gone through puberty yet, you can get your kid on puberty blockers. They're not permanent like HRT, they just postpone puberty until a child can make a more secure decision.

But seriously, just use their name and pronouns. And if they tell you that they're actually not trans in a few years, than that's fine. People experiment; it's a part of life. It's just important to support your child through this.
I highly recommend seeking out a therapist specializing in gender identity or at the very least lgbt friendly. A decent therapist can help your child make sense of what they are feeling and, maybe just as importantly, provide guidance on the best ways to move forward.

 
As one who does not have supportive parents, I will say the best thing you two can do as parents is provide a safe and loving environment where your child can be who they are and have the freedom to walk on this journey.
It’s funny how we tend to gravitate to people who are like us without really realizing it.

In fact, many of the friends I used to have before I came out have all come out at queer in some way now.

I guess like attracts like.
Queer kids tend to clump together even before they come out. Having friends who are openly not cis or not straight also makes it much easier to actually talk about being trans. I knew when I was a kid and didn't tell anyone, mainly because I didn't know how my friends would react.


Food for thought. The ""social contagion"" theory of transness often comes from people with an agenda, and that agenda is usually ""fewer trans people"".
A gender identity therapist is never a bad idea. From a non related therapist of course. Not even someone friendly with any of the family to avoid any bias,either way. If this is what he wants, be supportive of the exploration and take small steps together. Use the preferred pronouns and maybe discuss names. Shop for shop clothes. If he truly isn't trans,with the proper path that will be more apparent. If he is,he knows he's got a support team in his family and THAT is everything. You seem really understanding and willing to accept whatever is true but remember, even when things get tense or esp difficult, never be disparaging even in a heated moment. That can scar forever. I wish my daughter understood better who she was when she was younger,because the earlier they know (for sure,with guidance) the better for them in the long run. Best best best wishes and love from another parent X
I mean for a start you could try to call them by he/him, and also say that they are trans rather than want to be. You need to support them as a parent, even if it’s a hard change to make, they won’t be going on hormone and they won’t be getting surgery at this point. So the most important thing is for you to support them whether they are trans or not, and support the identity that they want to present as.
The phenomena of several people in a friend group all coming out as trans/nb is a result of queer people tending to become friends with other like-minded queer people. It's a matter of feeling safer, more comfortable, and accepted amongst people who have a similar perspective, vibe, and experience to you which becomes a foundation for a supportive friend group. Then when one person starts coming out to the others and everyone sees that theyre not being ostracized or discriminated against, then the others feel safe to start coming out as well. It's social coalescence and mutual support, not a social contagion. It sounds like your kid has a great support structure around them and you should feel proud that they trust you enough to share this part of themselves. I knew I was genderqueer/trans from about the same age but didn't feel comfortable sharing it with my family and socially transitioning till I was 30. The intervening years were hell and full of self-destructive behaviour. You and your kid are doing great. Congrats!
You might want to talk to a specialist about puberty blockers. They don’t do anything harmful, all they do is delay puberty and buy some time for your child before the commit to a particularly gendered puberty. It would honestly be an amazing thing to be able to do for your child, few people get to have the option to go through the puberty of their choosing.
You cannot be influenced to ""become"" transgender. This concept was scientifically disproven in 2017, to ease your worry.

Nothing your child decides on has to be permanent, they cannot have surgeries or get on hormones until 18, so let them experiment now and potentially save them from years, or decades of suffering.
I appreciate that you’re trying to support your kid. And I can appreciate that you would have concerns about what your kid might experience as part of their transition. But I need to point out that you stated your biggest concern about it being a trend or some form of peer pressure in the sentence after you said that your kid has expressed some version of the idea that they were or wanted to be a boy since they were two years old. 

Even assuming that the friend group is a factor in your kid wanting to transition now, I would tend to think any influence is more about feeling safe enough with those friends start taking steps towards their transition, rather than being talked into something that they wouldn’t otherwise want to do. 

I’ve purposefully used they/they pronouns and not used gendered words like ‘son’ and ‘daughter’ to refer to your kid, because it sounds like either you’ve not being using the appropriate pronouns for them, or haven’t spoken to them about what they want on this. It’d be reasonable to assume that if they want to transition and present as a boy that he/him pronouns would be correct, but not every person is the same. I don’t think I’d ever recommend against speaking with a reputable, quality mental health professional, but a first step in showing support to your kid would be to talk about these sorts of simple elements. Ask them things like “what pronouns should we use for you here at home, and should we always use them for you or use something else in certain circumstances?” They might want to use he/him pronouns most of the time, but in some situations, say with certain parts of the family or officially at school with teachers, may want to stick with she/her. Likewise, whether they’ve come up with one they want to use or not, they may want to use a different name, especially if their birth name is particularly gendered. 

Let your kid take the lead on this. Be clear in listening to what they’re telling you, and back that up with your actions.
Sounds like they’ve known for as long as they’ve been able to communicate in words and concepts, so I can’t imagine you would be doing anything except being great parents by letting them transition and getting them all the best resources
since they've been saying this since they were 2, i'm pretty sure this is entirely their choice.

obviously, they're only 10, so any transitioning for the moment is purely social. there's nothing they can do permanently at this age, so there's no harm in it. in year or two, you can look at getting them puberty blockers, and that should give them a few more years to be sure about anything more permanent.

also, with the peer pressure thing - though i certainly hadn't made these friends by 10 years old, in secondary school i managed to accidentally gravitate to fellow queer people. me and a couple of close friends both started coming out at similar times, though none of us were out when we met. it's actually pretty common for queer kids to accidentally end up all friends with each other, before even knowing it.
it could be a case of one of her friends came out which made her comfortable as that happened with my friend group. i came out and then 2 of my friends (both girls) said they had been dating for a few years so maybe its that?
I’d recommend a social transition first. There are real benefits in starting hormones early so if the social transition goes well, at like 15-16 (up to you’re preference), it might make sense to start considering them.

The first step, I think, is to start calling him by his preferred pronouns. See how he reacts. For me, it feels so affirming for people to get my pronouns correct. If you mess up, just correct yourself. 

I see a therapist that specializes in the LBGTQ+ community. I’d highly recommend that too.
it’s probably not peer pressure. if i knew friends who were talking about gender identity when i was 10, i probably would’ve figured out im trans a lot sooner. there’s no harm to social transition. plus i think if a child wasn’t trans and did a social transition, they would discover quite quickly that they aren’t trans. the gender therapy and psychologist will certainly help.
Allow kids to play with gender. It's good for everyone, cis or trans. I would have lived with so much less pain if I could have. 

Also, it's possible she picked these queer friends **because** they understand her. It might have not even been conscious. I'm 33 and many of my old friends are coming out as trans. We're too OLD to follow trends. Our hearts just found someone who understood us. It took our brains a while to figure out why. 

I am so glad your kid has friends and family who support them. So many of us don't have that. Thank you
If your child hasn’t gone through puberty and isn’t already on blockers I would try to put them on it. Blockers have no side effects but Essentially just halt puberty which makes it a lot easier to medically transition later on. Because of their age I agree with everyone else and say let them socially transition first and then maybe have a discussion in a year or two about where they want to go from there. You both sound like amazing parents.
Even if this is a thing with the friend group, the worst thing that happens if you let your kid socially transition and they change their mind later is that they know you will support them in their exploration of themselves.
If they started this at two and is sticking with it all the way to ten I think its a pretty safe bet that its not just because of their friend group. I'd recommend letting them transition socially and sticking to it until they're a bit older to see how they wear it. I think hormone blockers may help too! I wish you the best of luck and send lots of love!
Let your child experiment. Nothing permanent needs to be done, but experimenting with names, pronouns, and clothing does no lasting harm. If this turns out to be a phase, then your child knows they can talk to you about things and will feel safe coming to your about how they feel. If this is who they are, then they will be glad you were supportive.
My kid said it when they were 3. Then brought it up again a few years later. Just because it wasn’t a daily occurrence at the time, doesn’t mean it wasn’t still the truth. Kids don’t always have the words to say everything they feel. Our kid sees a gender therapist and there is a diagnostic checklist for the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. They interviewed me and my child separately and before they gave a diagnosis. They also talk with my child regularly and we are monitoring for signs of puberty and when to start blockers. Support your child by letting them socially transition. They can change their hair and clothes, name and pronouns, but you don’t have to do anything permanent yet. Get a gender counselor and see what they think after talking with your child. If you child decides they don’t want to present a certain way anymore, then they can just change their hair, clothes, name and pronouns back. It really is no permanent risk at this age. Even if they start blockers, those are temporary as well. Show your child your really do support them for who they are, no matter what. Not supporting them will cause more permanent damage than anything else.
>We are supportive of all of it and have told her so since she was two when she would say she wished she were a boy.

This right here, you claim to be supportive yet your child has told you they where a boy since they where 2 and now you are thinking they are only wanting to transition due to others and peer pressure
Puberty blockers and social transition, then if she feels like it when she can medically transition later. Also therapy is always good.
There's no harm to let them socially transition. That's the great thing in young years. It's the best way to discover yourself. A (affirmative and progressive) gender therapist for children would also be great. Accept your kids identity and let them discover themselves. I wish I had that opportunity as a child.

I'm absolutely stunned that children of 10 years discuss gender identity so much. Sadly since I've seen some stories I believe that parents can be too pushy about it. It's best to just be supportive and let your kid find themselves. Don't make them some social media figure or expose them. Just let your kid be a kid. Let them be who they are. 

At the age of 10 there's usually Still some time too discover left before needing to think about puberty blockers but just have in the back of your mind that they exist and would be an option to buy more time.
Wait, if I'm reading this correctly, he wants to be a guy? If that's so, politely stop the misgendering lol

Second, as other people said. Let him socially transition and see if he wants to start hrt or if he wants to go back to their AGAB (I don't know words, that probably sounds offensive to someone lol) 

Finally, support him in other ways if you can. Something small, like clothes I guess would be a start
u/pwrof3 please do not think that having gender dysphoria is a ""trend"". This is a really dangerous right wing/terf trope. Your kid will be desperate to be who they really are.
It’s very important to note that it’s never just a fad or thing among friends.

It seems like there are so many sexualities, genders, pronouns now and as though all the influx of people coming out is some kind of fashionable trend, I can understand that perspective.

But people who come out very rarely ever go back in. This is an era of people being true to themselves, questioning what they like / feel rather than being told by the generation before them what they’re supposed to like / feel.

Just food for thought. :)
There are 110 comments at the time of me writing this, but hey it sounds like I was in a very similar situation to your child when I was their age (I came out and transitioned from female to male under similar circumstances), so here’s some context for what things were like for me back then:

1) I came out as bisexual when I was fourteen, on the same night one of my friends did. Turns out I was pansexual, actually, but that took me a couple of years to figure out (close enough, right?) Anyway, with a few LGBT+ friends in our group, we assumed we were the ‘gay friend group’ at our school, but by the time we were 18 and graduating, it had turned out that *all* of the cliques at our school were like that. 1/10 people being LGBT is now considered to be a conservative estimate by some accounts, so the odds of your child being the only queer person in their circle of friends were never high.

2) I’m 22 now. I came out to my friends as non-binary at sixteen (didn’t tell my parents for almost a year, didn’t think they’d believe me - I was right, they didn’t) and then I came out as a transgender man at seventeen. It’s been five years. My memory of being a teenager is mostly just scraps of stress and the paralysing fear that I’d never be able to access the resources to transition because my parents would never agree to help me. Your kid doesn’t understand that you genuinely don’t know how being trans works, because your kid has always had access to all the scientific and academic information they could possibly ask for because the Internet exists. It took me years to understand that my parents weren’t being wilfully ignorant - they just hadn’t done the couple of hundred hours of medical research that I’d done by the time I came out at seventeen. Your child’s friends have probably been discussing this for a long time in part because your kid will have been doing their homework about this for a *long time* to be sure about their feelings before coming to you about it. They probably even already know about the whole ‘parents of trans kids almost always assume it’s down to peer pressure for the first few years’ thing, because it’s such a common experience that it’s been a running joke for at least a decade.

3) I’d heard other people voice the same concerns that my parents voiced (and that you’re voicing now), dozens of times anecdotally online or in my research, well before my parents ever said them. Usually word-for-word. Genuinely I have no idea who’s passing this identical script around to every trans kid’s parents but just know that your kid has thought about their current feelings more carefully than you could ever ask them to, and has already seriously considered a lot of the concerns that they knew you were going to have.

4) Sometimes people come out as non-binary, realise they’re actually transgender a year later, and then stick with that second realisation for the rest of their life. That’s what I did. (Hi again.) Generally the way people identify changes in small ways over time, and there’s nothing to say that your child won’t discover a more nuanced understanding of how they feel over time that leads them to a different label, but that’s not a *problem* , because I promise you there are no negative repercussions to experimentation. There are some serious repercussions to your kid deciding they need to hide their feelings from you, though. Your child will figure it all out eventually, no matter what anyone around them says or does. The important thing is that they shouldn’t be suffering while they’re figuring it out, and god knows I was suffering being addressed as a girl for years when I’d privately figured out by fifteen years old that whatever else I was, I definitely wasn’t a girl.
At that age social transition is really the most you can do. None of that is permanent. Let him have a haircut (if they change their mind later it’s just hair it grows back). Try out he/him pronouns. Buy a few new outfits. Let your child explore their gender. It doesn’t have to be a lot just a little bit of recognition. If it doesn’t fit they’ll know and let them know it’s safe if they try something and it doesn’t fit. It’s always ok to go back or try something else

Many have already told you great things. I do believe a childrens therapist would a good call. It certainly doesn’t harm! And yes, support him, gender him correctly, use the name he wants and get him boy clothes. If he’s still happy that way in three years consider hormones blockers, but that’s still a long way. And if he ever changes his mind at any point whatsoever, that’s also fine!
I definitely reccomend therapy sessions to help work through every thing. that said, at 10, let them transition socially. theres literally no harm in doing so and if it's a fad, they'll want to stop soon enough. this will give you and your child time to figure out if anything more is neccessary. If possible, I would get in contact with a pediatric endocrinologist if possible to begin discussing the potential(after years of living socially as the desired gender) of puberty blockers but you have a couple years still before thay'll be needed.

main thing to know is you're already doing a great job just by asking advice and not dismissing it outright. it can be scary but trans kids with accepting homes are much more likely to become happy, well adjusted adults.
First of all, don’t misgender your child respect them and their pronouns. Second of all the only type of transition they can have is social, which isn’t permanent or semi permanent it can be changed instantly and doesn’t have an effect despite letting your kid figure out who they are. If this has been a before mentioned thing since they where two then it’s almost definitely not a phase and isn’t peer pressure. If your kid hits puberty soon the only other transition would be puberty blockers which stops one of the worst experiences in a young trans person life, puberty blockers aren’t permanent either. Even if this does end up being a ‘phase’ let it be, let them explore themselves and figure out who they are in a safe environment, other wise your relationships will crumble under the restrictions of identity. 

This is coming from a trans guy who was refused the safe place to be trans and different, and has been fighting for the right of self expression since 7, just be supportive that’s all they need.
Imo, therapy never hurts. And social transition won't hurt anything, and even if you're worried about that whole social contagion thing people are putting forward, keep talking to your kid. If you're worried, you're the parent so therapy can be a safer place to raise those concerns, but don't let yourself out it in your own head without talking to your mini-person about it.
Y'all need to stop assuming that wanting to be a boy = he/him. Guys can use pronouns other than he/him, and gals can use ones other than she/her. Pronouns don't have gender.
I transitioned young. Questioning at 10, sure at 11, and began social transition at 12.

I told my parents I was trans in the hospital when everyone thought I was dying (I lived, obviously). I was tiny and 12 and sick. When they allowed me to transition, it gave me hope that drove me to get better. After I got out of the hospital months later, I began truly transitioning and getting better. 

Had my parents turned me away, I might not have made it. My parents' acceptance was EVERYTHING to me. After they accepted me as trans, I thought they'd accept me for anything, which they did. I'm open and honest with my parents. I tell them when I make a mistake. I tell them about when I break the rules and ask for forgiveness. I don't keep secrets.

In short, your acceptance means EVERYTHING to that child. Whether or not they are truly trans or if it is a phase, stand with them. If they change their mind, be there. If they decide to spend the rest of their life as a man, be there. Don't shame them. Love them either way. It could save your child's life.
Little correction, nobody ""wants"" to be transgender, however people ""are"" transgender, it is a big difference because it's never a choice to be transgender, be careful next time ^^
And for your kid I think puberty blockers would be the best, if they actually change their mind they can just stop taking them ans have a normal but late puberty
As the mom of a kid who transitioned at 14, medically at 16, just follow your kids lead, speak to an endocrinologist, follow through with the therapist, and have your own therapist so your own stuff doesn't get mixed up in everything your kid is figuring out and so you are strong enough to support them. My nb kid never verbally expressed their gender identity until age 14 but also never had iron clad notions of what has to be ""boy"" and what has to be ""girl.""
You really have nothing to worry about,  my kid came out at 11 and socially transitioned. Started on blockers at like 14 at 15 he went on T. After 2 years he decided that T wasn't really for him and is now non binary. At 19 he is going they/them/he ,has no regrets and is comfortable with how their body is.
Your kid is 10. Let me explore what's up, at 10 transition is social. Clothes, maybe hair if you feel like it, name and pronoun changes. This is nothing you need to worry about being influenced by someone else, because none of it is permanent.
people aren't trans because of being pressured into it. nobody ever is
There is NO social contagion. I repeat NO social contagion. It doesn’t happen. Not for being trans. This is a lie being told by people who don’t want trans kids (specifically trans boys/men) to exist. 

It’s called learning and trying to figure themselves out. 

They feel safe in their groups. Social transition harms no one. 

You need to find a gender supporting therapist. Work with them so your child can have independent sessions and sessions for you and whomever else in your family that needs to learn about being trans. 

IF it ever gets to the point of hormones, that takes years to get to. No doctor will just give out hormones to underage people. Doesn’t happen.

Since 10 is so young, I’d say send the child to a psychologist specialised in trans people. And I guess just sit down with your child, talk to them and understand their intentions.
She has been telling you since she was *two.* It is ***clearly*** not a new thing or a peer pressure thing. I won't even argue the rest. This has been going on for eight years, you said it yourself. To consider it peer pressure is reductive at best.  
Edited for pronouns since she isn't using he/him.
I want to emphasize nobody “wants” to be transgender. Nobody wants to be misgendered and feel uncomfortable in their own skin. Nobody wants to be harassed and shamed and threatened, or worse. Nobody wants to be afraid of their rights to live being taken away. Nobody NOBODY “wants that”. 

Edit: also, if your kid is expressing that they’d like to be addressed/treated as a boy, the least you could do is respect his pronouns.
Sorry I can't offer any words of wisdom but I will say that you guys are absolutely amazing and wonderful parents for being so supportive and trying to understand the situation ❤️
let ur child socially transition and therapy as well with a trans friendly therapist will also benefit bc it’s not like at this age ur child can do anything other than socially transition. but therapy will help ur kid navigate these feelings and learn to cope with them. 

and if it turns out ur kid isn’t trans that’s okay but atleast in the end they will know no matter what their parents have their back and that can lead to a hugely healthy relationship between all of you.

right now the changes are just clothes, hair, pronouns and maybe even a name who knows this is the discovery portion nothing more.
I didn’t figure out I was transgender until I was in my late twenties. My parents were shocked, still have trouble remembering to use my pronouns.
Let them explore, maybe they'll be happier as a boy, maybe they'll decide that they would rather be a girl or neither. But what will matter will be that you supported them and gave them space to figure out who they are. 

A counselor who specalizes in children and gender wouldn't hurt. Just so they have someone to discuss this with who could provide answers that you might not have.
Probably she gravitated towards LGBT+ kids because they have similar experiences that affect how they act towards others, in the case she could be doing this to fit in it's just a matter of making sure she knows her identity is always up to her, there are no wrong answers and she can always change her mind or go back. Gender is about what makes you feel the most comfortable, and letting her experiment with how she presents socially, helping her try out pronouns and names, letting her choose her hairstyle, etc is the best way to make sure she has all the resources to know what she's most comfortable with! Thanks to you and your wife for being good parents.
Nothing permanent is involved in transition at 10. Let them socially transition if that is what they want, as nothing irreversible is happening I don’t think worrying about whether this is best for them in this situation is necessary. It could be an important part of them learning who they are whether or not they are trans.
I’m going to be honest I knew I was trans from about age 8/9.  It’s definitely not the case for everyone but I’d recommend doing basic social transitioning first for him. But also start seeking out a therapist that can help explore/ help them understand their feelings.
the journey of being transgender is not easy. you both need to do what you can to make this less stressful since gender dysphoria is categorized as a stress disorder.

1. don't call your child ""she"" or ""a girl"" anymore. that only makes the person feel like they aren't doing enough. it could lead him to not wanting a relationship with either of you in the future because he will only feel invalidated around you.

2. take him into therapy immediately. as I said before it's not easy. you shouldn't try to do it alone. also being a child experiencing that means it will be 10x more difficult.

3. start with social transition over summer as he wishes. don't let him go towards medical transition for 6 more years unless it is an urgent situation. for example, if he was going to harm himself because of his body then do let him medically transition as soon as possible.

remember it's valid for you, as the parent, to be feeling like you lost your little girl throughout the transition so care for yourself too. even if you don't feel that at this moment, you might feel like that at some point.
I applaud you as a parent. Thank you for being one of the good ones. Therapy is obviously a great idea. 

I guess that while I do understand your concern, you need to remember two things: first, queer people often find each other, even before they come out or even acknowledge their queerness to themselves. So your kid's gender identity may have led to that friend group, rather than the other way around. Second, gender isn't so important that it can't be played with. If your child thinks ""I'm a boy"" and takes on that identity for a bit, only to realize that it is kind of shitty and she'd rather be a girl, you'd accept that, right? And the child who spent a little time on the other side of the fence is going to be a better person at the end of the day anyway. Letting your kid use a different name and pronouns and dress differently isn't going to hurt anyone permanently. Even puberty blockers are meant to delay puberty. It's not like you're going to be pumping him full of testosterone.

Hope that helps.
As someone whose parents thought I was being influenced by my friends when in reality I knew before any of them, and as someone whose parents thought they were doing the right thing by waiting to support me in case I was wrong: that can be incredibly damaging to your child’s trust in you, in your relationship and in their ability to trust anyone in general. Respect the social transition, and if your kid changes his mind later, that’s okay. But he knows who he is better than anyone else. He is most likely not going to change his mind. You don’t have to medically transition him yet, not by any means. But let him socially transition and let him feel comfortable coming to you. My parents didn’t do that for years and they wished they did in the long run because of how damaging that was to me as a young kid, and though they’re better now, that trauma still affects me as an adult. Give your kid support, that’s all he wants.
okay first thing, if your kid comes out as  trans you don’t continue to misgender them and call them your daughter. also, i understand thinking kids are “pressured” to be trans or gay but 90% of the time its not. when your kid is friends with other lgbt people its not because its popular among them, but because we feel safe and respected among other people like us, not because its trending. besides, if your kid said they wanted to be a boy for YEARS, its definitely not new.
I think if he’s been expressing this since a young age, it likely has nothing to do with friends. But even if this was due to some sort of confusion, what harm could it do?
let your kid transition, try to understand. not saying you have to give them hormones right now, but just mainly, talk to your kid. socially transitioning won't do anything permanent. even then if your kid somehow decided that they changed their mind, social transitions can be reversed. please don't misgender them though. just in short, listen and talk to your kid and make them feel safe.
You kid probably just found friend like him. And feels safe expressing his wish now. Even if it turned out he is wrong he won't figure that out without trying to socially transition. Be supportive try to see and treat him as your son. Allow him to buy boy clothing if he wants. Maybe change his room to be more boy-ish.
Let them test the water and help get him(your son now basically) a therapist to talk about it.  Therapist is actually critical for future stuff IE puberty blockers and such if I remember. Otherwise more importantly they will be able to talk him through it and give him an outlet for his emotions and such.  Personally just give them space and allow them to express themselves.

Honestly I think I had ideas of being transgender maybe since I was 10 or maybe even 8?  It was 20 years ago since I was 8 so not easy to remember.  But, the point is that it common for trans people to notice when they are young.
get hormone blockers as fast as possible and then when you have all the time you want to think about transitioning because cross sex hormones arent allowed before the age of sixteen and cross sex operation arent allowed before eighteen and hormone blockers only pause the making process of your own hormones and you can always stop taking rhem if you find out you are not transgender
but please immediately sign up for a transitioning clinic or something dont go to a psychiatrist with your child or something or therapy those are all in the clinic and maybe after a year or something or a year anda half or two theyll give you hormone blockers
it seems a little long but youre kid is very young and hormone blockers at the age of twelve is like every trans person wished they had that 
it will save so much potential sadness of your kid and it will make the rest so much easier
As pretty much everyone says let them social transition, get a trans affirming psychologist that is not family and therapist to help guide them with there feelings, you usually one doesn’t question gender especially from like 2 unless they are trans but for now social transition is till it is time for puberty blockers but even those aren’t permanent they just buy your child time to start hrt when they are ready if they ever are so they dont haft to go through the wrong puberty
Even if they were being peer pressured into this, what’s the worst that can happen? They spend some time exploring their identity before realizing it doesn’t fit them? That sounds like a great growing experience that everyone should have some time during their life. I think the psychologist might be a bit much. You might come off as unsupportive if you make them start seeing a psych while they are figuring these totally natural things out. I would let it play out and if it seems like they are struggling or need help through support that you can’t provide as a parent, then I would explore the therapeutic route.
I would be careful with concerns about whether or not your kid's trans identity is a product of peer pressure. I'm not saying there are never times and places to be concerned just that I've seen people make this assumption without good evidence. Not to imply anything about you in particular, but if there was ever a time to be extremely honest with yourself about how much you know about your kid's interests and friends it would be now. I've seen people assume that their kid is trans because that's what their friends are doing without knowing anything about their kid's friends. Even if it's true it's not fair to expect someone to take you seriously if you don't actually know what's going on.

Next, write some dates down. When did they talk to you? What did they say. Time passes differently for adults. It's good to have empirical measures of time. I've been transitioning for about six years now but I know to my parents it still feels like a ""new thing"" sometimes. It's good to have some account of what happened when, how long it's been.

Therapy is not a bad idea but it is important to remember it is not designed to be a trans test. It's a very real possibility they go to therapy for a while and they still want to transition and you're still concerned that it might be because of something else and it just feels like the same position you are in now just months or years later. Therapy is just guided introspection. There is no guarantee that it goes anywhere and there is even less guarantee that a person will come out of it looking from the outside like they've put more thought into their decisions.

At least for my parents, there was a big fear that they might be letting me make a big mistake. If that's you, it's worth putting effort into routinely deciding how much of that fear is reasonable and knowing what to do if it's not. For my parents I think a lot of the unreasonable fears can from the idea that being trans was an all consuming identity, that I was giving up who I was, and that nothing would ever be the same again. Seeing me do the things that I do but as a man really helped them. There are several parts there. You have to let them to some degree (starting small is great)  be a boy, do boy things but also try to see them as a boy and you have to be present for that. If you don't let them do anything or if you only let them do things when you aren't watching them it's going to be hard to trust that it works for them because you won't know. If you never see them as a boy from time to time, even if you let them do things it can be easy to view all the things they've done as ""not really transitioning"" so anything new can look like a big step.

This is the advice I would have given my parents so it might not be for you, but good luck.
One of my favorite podcasts is Science vs. The Science of Being Transgender. Take a look at it as well so you can learn a bit more about what it entails and means: [link](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6Ft9HunKBhXgRdLkdO4QLq?si=JmrmfjDGSHC8AOlBWwLwTg)
its a kid so they cant medically transition yet, but i think that letting them express themselves in a safe enviroment, and taking them to a therapist would be beneficial. at the end of the day, most of us were experimenting with our gender expression to find what feels the best for us and its common to do for kids/adolescents even if they are cis and hetero. at this age, socially transitioning and buying a lunchbox or a tshirt with a superhero instaed of a princess wont do harm to anyone, and if they decide they dont like it afterall, its all  good, if they decide it feels better to be treated as a boy, its also good
These no harm in letting them explore their identity as long as you support them and let them know that right behind them as they go forward regardless of whether they trans or not
Let them know you want the best for them and that they are the only one who truly knows how they feel 
Seeing a trans person probably just gave them the vocabulary to explain themselves 

I knew i was trans at like 4-5
I knew when I was 7, I tried coming out at 14 but was shot down due to fear, my family often thought I was gay etc due to my friendship group, and I understand just because it wasn’t the case for me doesn’t mean it is for your child, but this could be who they truly are. 

If you are worried this is for social reason maybe talk to your child and compromise, I recommend slow transition for anyone in the sense of social transition first, see how he feels using his preferred pronouns, having his preferred hair cut and clothes. You sound like you want to be supportive. Start by saying son/he/him (this isn’t a dig, genuine suggestion without hate) if he begins feeling euphoric, and happy take it from there. Definitely get him a gender specialist therapist, not to change him or convince him otherwise, just someone who can listen without judgement and understands the situation. 

You sound like you love you kid no matter who they are, which is nice to see. The world needs more supportive parents.

Sorry for the essay, others may disagree with me, this is just my opinion.
I have never understood why people find it so difficult to support a kiss in socially transitioning. it's like the lowest bar ever, to go back if he changes his mind, so are hormone blockers. Hell, even hrt is easily reversible within the first couple of weeks. The only thing I can say to you is support your son. if he says this is what he wants, it is.

Edit: also, your kid doesn't WANT to be trans, he IS trans.
Perhaps hormone blockers would be appropriate for now. They can go on T when they have confirmed their identity and decide to go ahead. To go on T in the early teens could be very harmful bc T mutilates forever with hair growth and voice changes and general masculinisation especially skeletal. So, in summary, block hormone effects until later on and sure, socially transition as a boy for now. I wish you all the very best of outcomes.
Give them the time to fully understand the aspects.
If they want to try being a boy, they can do that quite easily by adopting a more masculine name/nickname, dressing more boyish, and going by he/him pronouns for a while. If they love it, congrats, its a boy! If not, then they’re not a boy. 

Social transition is a two-way street: you can go back if you want to. Your child probably just needs a chance to try it out, to see if it’s for them. If they really are trans then allowing them to experiment now in a safe environment will save them YEARS of heartache. If they aren’t trans, then this will just be that funny year where they thought they might be a boy. No harm done.
It's definitely a good idea to get em in with a therapist to talk about it and make sure it's what they definitely want
around the same time was when i started thinking about queer identity a lot harder, along with my friends. I’m 15 atm, and we happen to be the queer group at school. Likely it turns out that your kid and their friends happen to be in a similar group, some phenomenon of queer kids not knowing they’re queer becoming friends is what I’ve noticed—theres probably not that much science backing that up, but i can tell you from experience, its not peer pressure or wanting to be like their friends. It’s a genuine feeling.
Gender therapy is always a good idea and I know you're trying to do right by your kid, but I worry about this line of thinking you're following. You said yourself that your child has been expressing this since she was 2. Plus, even if she didn't express it back then, the idea that his friends might be ""turning her trans"" is a non-starter. Nobody can turn a cis kid trans just like nobody can turn a trans kid cis. It doesn't work like that. If it did, almost none of us would be here right now. Now, sure, hearing about different gender identities might make someone wonder for a moment, but if it sticks, it means a genuine discovery has been made.

I also saw in another comment that she hadn't expressed this since she was 2 but is expressing it again now that she is around kids like him. To me, that says she now has the words to describe what she's been feeling the entire time, which is...my God, it's great. So many of us wish we had the words when we were younger and the fact that kids generally do today is amazing.

The best thing you can do is call her by whatever she wishes to be called, get her a good gender therapist who will work with her, and give her the chance to express himself through different hobbies, toys, hairstyles, age-appropriate styles of dress, and so on. Trans kids, more than anything, need love and room to breathe and be who they are, whoever that is. And I'm sure she'll be twice as delightful and happy once she realizes she can find her own way and be true to herself 😊

(For the other commenters who might see this and get concerned that I and her parent are using the wrong pronouns here, she said herself that she still wants to go by ""she/her"" for the time being.)
Socially transitioning and maybe puberty blockers when the time comes in 4-5 years. You all still have a lot of time to figure things out. Take it slow and listen to your child's feelings.
Psychiatrist first. Always.
The idea that transgender people are always actively aware that they are transgender is a dangerous myth.  While many of us can look back and see patterns of behavior and a history of recurring ideas, that does not mean that we understood the significance at the time.  Indeed one of the most common stories that trans people tell is how it is rather absurd that it took them however long it did to realize that they were transgender!  Many of us receive our first concrete signs as we approach the threshold of puberty.  Until then, boys and girls look more alike than not, and the primary difference in terms of identity is performative.

Beyond that myth is something a bit more practical:  the world gives transgender people plenty of reasons to keep their mouths shut even when they *do* figure it out.  From a very young age, little boys treat being called a little girl an insult, and little girls treat being called a little boy an insult.  Even as children, we are taught that being trans is a *bad thing to be*.  This lesson only becomes more decisive as time marches on.  We, like anyone else who might use the phrase ""in the closet"" to describe a part of their identity, did not choose to hide who we are because it seemed like a good idea, we do it because it seems like the less bad option.  Coming out is treated as an act of courage for a reason.

The questions that you are asking are good ones, and you are driven by good motivations.  You, no doubt, are aware adds difficulty, complexity, and danger to life.  You very naturally would want your child to be sure and to not do anything rash.  Something that is very important to understand is that these motivations can just as easily lead to great and terrible harm as anything good.  

And so that brings me to the first and most important thing you can do:  listen to your child, talk to them, and believe what they say.  It is important that they understand that you are a person who can be trusted without question.  The right kind of therapist can be a powerful ally for a host of reasons, but keep that first and most important thing in mind.  If your child doesn't like or trust their therapist, try to understand why and be prepared to go through a few before you find one that fits.  Finally, you need to allow them to express their identity as best they can.  At the moment this means going out into the world and presenting as a boy.  You may notice that they sometimes do or like ""girl things"".  If you do, *don't* treat them as signs that they're actually cisgender.  But even as you allow them to be themselves and support them, don't push them either as that can threaten that position of trust.  This is important because *identity is tricky*.  The second decade of human life is tumultuous and confusing for everyone, which means that it is entirely likely that your child's understanding of their identity will change over time.  If you push too strongly, you are in effect building a new closet for them to get lost in, and teaching them - however subtly - that perhaps there are some things best left unsaid for the time being.

Anything beyond that are questions for another day.  Be present, trust what they say, and let them explore their identity even if you think it might be a mistake.  Be the person in their corner and their place of safety.  Understand that wanting to keep them safe and happy is a noble thing, but that it is a thing that can lead to great harm as well.
Kids that are awkward or have a non standard identity often seek out friends with the same issues. So you might be mistaking the effect for the cause.
This is around the time I started exploring ideas I'd bender identity and being myself, transitioning with meditation and even getting to talk to a professional took a long time for me. 
In part, it's because I lived in a nowhere town. But it still takes some time to get in contact with doctors. 

For me at that time, I would talk with the school counselor a fair bit. The one I talked to help me get in touch with a doctor and organization that was willing to help me with stuff. Such as getting me to add from the doctor or professional therapist meetings and eventually the cost of meds. 

But even without seeing a doctor, therapist or even the counselor, people can explore themselves and the idea if gender identity without it. The kinds of clothes they wear and present themselves, how they want people to refer to them as and treat them. 

That's what I and a lot of others did say before seeing a doctor and starting HRT, dressing how we felt and referring to ourselves that way. Sometimes people are wrong about how they feel and there seems to be this idea transitioning happens over night, but it doesn't. Letting your kid take it slow and understand themselves while also treating them with respect should help you and then understand a lot more.
Ask her how her life would have been different if she had been born a boy. Get to the root of what she thinks gender is about. That might help clarify things.
I get that this might be a bit of a shock coming to you all at once, but I would recommend that you do your best to accept your kid as transgender and be supportive of them.
Talking with a psychologist would be good, and even if you don't as a minor they won't receive any permanent transitions so they have a long time to figure themselves out!
*nobody is trans because of peer pressure.*
if your kid came out as trans, he would probably be shamed, not celebrated.

your kid’s friends gave him the support he needed to realize he was trans, thats all!
nobody is peer pressuring anyone:)
You should do everything you can to support your child - I've seen what happens to kids when their parents try to suppress their true selves. Any ""transition"" at your child's age would be purely social, and no part of it would be permanent in the least, so I wouldn't worry about them doing it because of peer pressure - it really doesn't work like that, but even if it is the case, it won't matter because social transitions are fully reversible.

All you need to do is reassure your kid, make sure they know you love them and accept them in whatever shape or form they may come in.
at the age of 10 there isn´t much stuff to do (atleast nothing involving medicalization). A psychologist may be good, but u have to be sure that isn´t gonna hurt the kid. Respect to their friends, i think it´s completly normal to come out if the enviroment is friendly. So i wouldn´t get worry about it. U should assure ur kid that it´s gona be safe and supported no matter who they are or how they identify as.
I think talking to a counselor who specializes in gender identity is great! Talk to the therapist first to find out their approach.  There are counselors with bias in this field, like any other. Make sure they are neutral about the path your child should take. They should BP either encourage nor inhibit your child. The process should be one of discovery. Your child may be more comfortable talking to a stranger than they would be with you, so don’t feel bad about that. Being trans comes with a lot of emotional baggage, particularly the negative emotions foisted on us by society about ourselves. 

Realize that you really can’t influence what your child chooses in the long run; you can only help them feel better about themself and avoid the crippling feelings of self loathing many of us (me) have had to overcome. That you are asking these questions puts you way above most parents. Thanks for your sincere efforts on behalf of your child!
Everyone else is bringing up good points, so my bit is that if the kids have been discussing gender identity for the better part of a year, as you said, and the little one has gone thru that thinking phase and decided to bring it up to you, her parent, that she wants to maybe try socially transitioning and eventually maybe new pronouns and stuff, then doesn't that speak to a level of consideration beyond peer pressure?

Also, if you and your spouse want to bring in a psych/therapist, please do choose someone who specializes in gender/lgbtq+ issues. Therapists who aren't trained on such matters might not handle delicate issues like this as well as they could, since they may have never received training or done the proper research on the lgbtq+ community to give valid advice.
Yeah let them socially change certain things but give them room to change their mind if they want to. If they say they’re one thing one day and another thing another, just go along with it. Something will eventually stick and then support them in whatever eventual conclusion they give! Wouldn’t go down the medical route rn, things may be permanent and if they changed their mind, that wouldn’t be the best.
You should get your son on puberty blockers. They are safe and completely reversible.
At this age the best you can do to support your child is respect any new name they want to go by, pronouns and let them dress/look the way they want. Haircuts and boy clothes.
I definitely think that this is more because they feel safe to come out in their current friend group than because of peer pressure.
I don't know your kid but the best thing will probably be to let them socially transition and make it clear that you'd be accepting even if they ended up wanting to go back to their AGAB.
Gender counseling is an excellent idea.
Take your kid to a gender therapist. At his age it would only be a social transition so if it is because of peer pressure (which is extremely unlikely) he will be able to detransition whenever.
A lot of folks here have offered some really good advice. Rather than repeat what’s been said, I just want to say that I think you sound like a great parent. It’s totally understandable to feel confused/concerned, but you really seem to have your child’s best interests at heart. I wish more parents were like you💕
If she has seriously been considering this and honestly wants to transition than before puberty kicks in is probably the best time. It doesn't sound like a whim or peer pressure since she's said this since she's been a toddler. Best wishes and make sure before permanent changes are made she still feels and knows she needs to transition. Probably hormone blockers would be good for now to delay puberty than when ready she can pube as she wishes as male because that's what she wants or as female should she change her mind.
Queer kids generally group together even if subconsciously- I wouldn’t be worried about “peer pressure”. I came out before a lot of my friends and a lot of them followed suit weather it be sexuality or gender, but we’re all so much happier being able to express ourselves- especially around each other.
Gender psychiatrists are an amazing idea especially with a child so young
My 11 year old son(ftm) came to me and told me he wanted to be called Tommy and for us to use he/him pronouns. It’s really not a big deal to buy him some boy clothes and use his preferred pronouns even if he changes his mind next year because it’s just showing support. It’s not medically at his age so I don’t really see the harm and it makes him SO HAPPY. Whatever comes down the line we will be supportive then as well. I think for our kids the most important thing we can do as they grow and try to discover themselves is show them we love them no matter what and accept them for who they want to be. I’m so glad to hear your son has such great supportive parents and I wish you well for your journey together :)
something that tends to happen in friend groups, is if one person comes out, then the rest will likely come out shortly after. its less of a peer pressure thing or doing it cus its cool, it is moreso that they feel more comfortable in their small circle of friends to be themselves. most queer people tend to stick together, even before they come out.

i appreciate you taking the time to learn about this rather than immediately shut them down. its a long journey but the best you can do is to just be a support for your son and listen to their experiences and what they want from you. physically transitioning isn't something kids can do, at least depending on the state, so social transitioning is all that means, which is 100% reversible if they do realize one day that they arent trans. you got this!!
advice from a trans kid here. I would say be very open and treat her like an adult with the way you talk to her. Tell her you are willing but take it slow, that way she knows you are with her but want to make sure she is comfortable with herself. Communication is VERY important, especially at her age. :)

edit: I’d like to say the summer transition is also a good benefit for everyone. It lets the person get used to their new presentation on their own before opening up to the (usually unwanted) judgement of others. The same way that you would want to learn to hit a baseball before you join a team. Reduces the feeling of awkwardness for the person and helps them learn without stress of what others think :) 

I’d also like to thank you on behalf of your child for being very supportive and having the good mindset that you do. Keep that good relationship with your kid ❤️
I think going to a therapist or psychologist who specializes in this is a wonderful idea. To be honest, at your child’s age, the furthest they can really transition is wardrobe, name, haircut, and all that stuff. I don’t see any harm in letting your child experiment with these things. Maybe your child will end up just being cis! But it’s always good to explore. 

I will say this about friends though: queer kids often group together at a very early age. It’s just a subconscious thing (which slowly becomes conscious as they age). I met my best friends in a childrens choir. Some of us knew each other as early as 3 years old. Five of us turned out to be trans that I know of and not a single one from our main friend group is straight. These things just happen, and it can be a good thing. 💜
I would consider puberty blockers as well. Im FTM and  started it during 3rd grade… medically speaking my mother should of informed my doctor so I could go on them regardless of being trans or not, but my pediatrician didn’t know. I was expected to be taller but was stunted because of that. Also helps further down the line if they decide they want to fully physically transition in their teens… they might be able to avoid the hassle of binding, becoming curvy, and top surgery in the future.

Edit: Sorry this comment was pretty vague, and you probably dont know much about puberty blockers, but they just slow down puberty until a later time in a child’s life. Many cis kids use it because they were like me who experienced it too early. This may not be the case for your kid but it is something to consider.
My kid began letting me know at about age 3 he was trans. He's 16 now and many of his friends are gender non conforming. He's done hormone blockers and takes Testosterone. Regardless of what his friends are doing, we chose to take him at his word. He is both drawn to, and others who are non binary, trans, etc. and these kids in turn are drawn to him. They have that in common. Trust your kid. Listen to them. Be glad he has a circle of friends going through the same things as they are.  To do anything else is to risk depression, self harm, suicide, etc.  When they are older, should they decide they are cis, no harm, no foul.
If he's been saying this since he was a boy, it makes me think it's him, not a trend. But even if it is a phase, what's wrong with supporting a kid through a phase. My oldest wanted to be goth and we let them wear all black. My middle said she's a girl and we let her wear girl clothes. Same thing as far as I'm concerned. At this age it's just clothes and name. And the consequences of not supporting them are so much worse than the consequences of letting them live as a gender and changing their mind. I mean, no one's doing surgery on a 10 year old.
Hi there! It's great that you're being supportive of your kid. She's 10, the same age I was when I told my parents I wanted to transition. At that age, it's only social. Ask her how she feels about getting a haircut, clothes, using different pronouns, etc. Medical transitions don't happen until at least 16.
Please please please respect your kid's wishes! If your kid is indeed a trans male, please refer to him with he/him pronouns if that's what your kid wants.
It sounds to me like she has some excellent parents. God bless
Ok, first off good on you for trying to help your kid!

I am a trans man, 29. I started medically transitioning at 25. My parents were first made aware of my discomfort from toddler age as well. I have a lifetime of memories trying to navigate living as a trans person. But personally, I am super grateful there was not so much buzz around trans-ness while I was growing up as there is now. Coming to terms with what it means to live as a trans person is an incredibly personal experience that I think is wildly over-trivialized by the focus on the social aspects of transitioning and doing so as young as possible.

I’m definitely not anti-trans kids, I was one and I am super proud of myself for surviving what was sometimes an extremely disorienting experience (especially around and after puberty), but I know I’ll get dragged here if I say more so if you want to DM about anything I’m around
Fantastic! Im glad to see another supportive parent. First, I would make sure to confirm the pronouns they want to use, and see if they identify as nonbinary or as a man. Second, transitioning at that age mostly includes physical appearance changes and potentially hormone blockers. I would find a gender therapist to help determine what’s right for them. Other than that, just try to support them in whatever they ask, I’m sure they know what they want better than anyone else!
Having them talk to psychologist is the best thing to do, and then you, the psychologist, and your kid can kinda go from there to see what's the best thing to do
def would do trans friendly and specializing psychologist as others are recommending
get hormone blockers as soon as possible 
after that your kid has all the time to think about their gender and if they think theyre not trans they can immediately go back and continue getting their own hormones

please trust us there is nothing worth more than your kids happiness and hormone blockers will save so much because puberty will hurt your child in every way possible
OP: My child has been saying they're trans since 2 years old

Also OP: Is this peer pressure?

😑
Definitely see a therapist. All trans people have to see therapists anyway in order to obtain access to hormones and surgery, and you also want to make sure your child is doing this for the right reasons (i.e. genuine gender dysphoria) and not for superficial reasons you yourself mentioned.
How about you stop misgendering your kid then? If they want to be a boy then stop with the ""she/her"" terminology.

They haven't been forced or coerced or brainwashed - they came to you because they trusted you.

Don't ruin that trust now by questioning something they've wanted for 8 years, just love and support them however you can.
Please dont call them a her
It's he, not she, start there and helping him socially transition will be much easier for you both.
People don't just decide they ""want to be transgender"" you're born that way.

Check PM
You could start by not misgendering him in every single sentence after explaining he confided in you in telling you he sees himself as a boy.
Watch out for the pansexual friend they’ll fuck anything

Try starting with using the pronouns they prefer
I'm a trans woman.  My 14 year old AFAB child just came out to me a couple weeks ago.  I'm overjoyed for them and told them that if they need any meds or whatever to ask and I'll make it happen. 

I came up in the late '80s and early '90s and didn't have that support or my life would have turned out much different.  I never want to see either of my kids live through the shit I did.  Because of this, I will walk to the ends of the earth to let them know that they are perfect and beautiful and absolutely accepted just they way they are. 

At 10, transition is strictly social.  Let them do it, there's no legitimate reason not to.  If it's a phase or an attempt to fit in, it'll pass.  Don't count on that happening though.

Being transgender is an adventure.  It more a blessing than curse, but it is challenging.  Make sure your kiddo is safe, fed and loved.  Just accept them blindly and support them in their ventures.  Kids learn more from what they see than what we tell them.  Be the person that you want your children to grow to be.  

You have a very special child.  Please treat them as such. 

Love and light to you and your family; blessed be.
Allow them to socially transition. If they have a certain preferred name or pronouns besides their deadname and AGAB pronouns call them that. I do honestly believe that taking them to a therapist that specializes in gender identity could be a good idea too, especially at this age. Best of luck to you and your kiddo!
I can tell you something. When I accepted who I am ended up in no time surrounding myself with queer people. There is a chance your kid surrounded themselves with queer people because they are queer and not the other way arround. 

I didn't get to transition as a kid and I fanstasized about growing up into a woman from at least 13 years old if not sooner. I am just 100% that I remember realising being trans then and puting a word at the feeling. However I was getting excited by femme things as long as I can remember. If your kids tells you that they probably not saying lightly and you should be honored as a parent that you made your child feel safe enough in this age to tell you such a deep desire. I manage to tell my mother at 23 and I still haven't told her my name at 27. 

I can only say support her. And something that someone did to me when I first chose a name. If your kid chooses a name try to always use it. Even if they do something that needs punishment, never ever use their dead name as a punishment (deadname: the name you gave them, I prefer to call it my artist name because dead name kinda dramatic). Make sure you are not doing it as a favor and as a reward. You are accepting your kid full time no limitations. Using the chosen name shows love and using it only when you are happy with them is situational love and it sucks. 

Everything I said doesn't mean your kid is 100% trans. There are people here who say that they are not trans. Not many, but it can happen. However the only way for your kid to be certain is to allow them to fully express and experiment with their identity. If you give them space then they will make the correct decision for sure. 

Maybe offer to discuss names with them being part of the journey could be fun for them if they haven't chosen one yet. That one is a brainstorm idea honestly, but I did ask my mother how they would have called me if was born a girl and I simply didn't like it. I wish I could straight up discussed names with her
Do social first (clothes, name, ect) then do the medical if after a year or two it still feels right
my dude let the kid explore his gender. also unless i’m reading it wrong kiddos been telling y’all he’s a boy for 8 years. additionally gender is a social construct there’s a lot more wiggle room then people like to acknowledg
You seem like a very loving and caring parent, but I think that you might be a little bit misguided in some areas. I know that it can be scary for your kid to ask about transitioning, especially at such a young age, but I can assure you that there will be no permanent procedures done at that age, even if your family does take that route in the future.

Now, about the whole peer pressure thing, I can't tell you one way or another what's happening. It could be a phase or it could be how your kid really feels, but none of that matters right now. What matters is that they are telling you what they need from you to feel comfortable and safe. A psychologist with expertise in gender identity is definitely a good idea, but you do not need the green flag to start listening to your kid.

Right now, transitioning means using a different name and pronouns, cutting their hair differently, wearing different clothes, and possibly being sorted differently for sports and bathrooms. I promise that none of that is going to hurt your kid if this turns out to be a phase.

What will hurt them is if you don't start taking their identity seriously. You need to be there to love and support your kid 100%, regardless of any personal hesitations (remember, nothing about transitioning is permanent for a kiddo so young). If this turns out to be a phase, your support will show them that it's okay to experiment and that you won't be mad if they want to go back to their old gender presentation. If they turn out to be trans after all, you will be helping to keep them out of some of the awful statistics associated with homelessness, suicide, and poor mental health statistics associated with being trans.

TLDR: I promise that ""transition"" is purely social and non-permanent at this age. Look into psychologists, but do not wait any longer to start supporting your kid in what they tell you makes them comfortable.
Just let them socially transition, and make sure you let them know that if they change their mind or find that their identity is different than what they thought it was, that it’s completely okay, and that discovering your gender identity takes a long time. Also be sure to tell them that gender is a spectrum, and that they shouldn’t be afraid to look up or study how they’re feeling in regards to their own gender. Of course, make sure they know they can ask you, but I’m assuming neither you or your wife are super involved in the trans community, so be ready to help them research their own identity as well if they need help. Wishing your kiddo the best! ❤️
I told my dad I wanted to be a boy and go by he and him at around that age (possibly twice). Clearly, it didn’t stick either time, because it didn’t feel quite right, and I went back to interacting as a girl…but as soon as I found out that flavours of nonbinary were actual gender options as a young adult, I was like ‘oh, that one, obviously’. Ftr, two gender, which for me is I’m a girl and I’m a boy, both at the same time. Which I would not have been as clear on if I hadn’t tried stuff and found out what didn’t work for me, as well as what did. 

Point is, my dad just went with it and let me figure it out on my own. If your kiddo socially transitions and then decides they don’t want to anymore, then…ok? They can socially transition again towards whatever feels righter. Figuring out who we are is a journey. It’s all good. 

Oh also: it’s actually a pretty good plan to try it out over the summer, because then they can get a sense of if it’s working for them before school starts and it has to become bureaucratic.
Www.genderdysphoria.fyi
has SO much high-quality information which you'll all benefit from.  Its author takes a lot of time to keep it updated with the latest credible medical research.

If your child has insisted since age two that she is really a He - he knows himself better than you do, and I'll bet you would be wise to respect that.  Sure, ""fads"" can and do occur - but gender dysphoria isn't one where that frequently happens. 

Why would a male wantvto be a female? They wouldn't.  Why would a girl want to be a boy?  There are a lot of valid reasons, but none are more important than one's innate sense of their own identity.

At 10, yiu will necessarily need to give immediate attention to puberty blockers - to halt any furthur physical maturation.  This is not ""hormones""; it's the opposite.  It will facilitate his social integration with others, M and F, as a male....without his breasts developing, or periods starting.  IF, at any point, this seems not to be right somehow; merely stopping the blockers will quickly allow puberty to resume, and the body will *quickly* catch up to where it should have been. In other words, there is little to nothing to lose, and a LOT to gain, for Now and especially for his future.

I really believe you will find most of the most common concerns addressed in the site above, and since you won't be the first or only parents facing this - you definitely came to the very best place for the latest reputable information.
Some points to consider, in no particular order:

* Your child might appreciate you calling them ""he"" and ""son"". This can also help trying to find out whether your child truly wants to transition, e.g. if being gendered male ends up feeling wrong after a while, they will tell you.

* Therapy with a specialist is highly recommended, just be cautious that you find one who is truly supportive of trans people.

* It is not uncommon in groups of friends that many of them turn out queer in one way or another. But people don't do this in order to fit in (to the contrary, being out as anything LGBT+ related often makes it harder to fit in outside of LGBT+ circles). Rather, it is a combination of multiple factors:

  * People who are feeling different in on way way or another, even on a subconscious level, tend to flock together, especially if they have trouble fitting in with people otherwise.

  * Being surrounded by LGBT+ friends makes it easier for someone to also step out of the closet, when in a different social group they might end up keeping it all bottled up.

  * No one has any exact numbers, but the portion of the population that is actually LGBT+ in some way or another is not as low as some people might think (I personally suspect at least 20%), especially considering that many orientations and gender identities are able to pass as cis and/or hetero if the circumstances do not allow a coming out.
So far I've been seeing Good comments talking about socially transitioning (clothes shopping hair cut etc) I'd also like to advice u to see if your kiddo can get some gender identity focused therapy. (At least where I am) the waiting lists are crazy long for that type of stuff so the earlier you're on it the better there they will explorer with her what she'd want now and or ij the future and they can help getting to the right recourses. 

I also get you might think it's a form.of wanting to fit in (and that is a possibility) but I have noticed that queer kids tend to associate with eachother even before realising or comming out as queer. I wish you and your kiddo the best!!
I suggest going for puberty blockers once their old enough, no bad side effects to them, and if they change their mind they’ll go through ‘normal’ puberty once they stopped taking them 


this is coming from a 17yr old transman who can’t socially/medically transition because of my parents 
.. I’ve wanted puberty blockers since I was 12-13ish 
, and was to afraid to ask for them…

 I regret it everyday. I hate my body. And I would do anything to have had them.. 


Of course you should ask your kid if they’d want to go on puberty blockers but truly it’s something that will help save so much discomfort in the future if they want them
Have an open conversation with your kiddo about what they would prefer to be referred as, any social changes they wish to make (changes in presentation) and be there to support them. Journal of adolescent health published a study confirming trans kids with a supportive environment have their risk of suicidal behavior cut in half. Take them to a gender therapist. Don’t worry about medical transitions, your kid is far to young for any doctor to even consider that. At this point it’s new clothes, haircuts, and using their correct pronouns.
somehow doubt is the only kind of “support” that comes to most cis peoples minds. try to beat the odds and just listen to them
A conversation with a therapist who specializes in gender identity sounds like an awesome idea. HOWEVER, there has been a disturbing rise in “therapists” painting themselves as specializing in gender identity, but they are just conversion therapists who will try to dictate your kiddo’s gender identity to them and to you. A good therapist will never tell you what was talked about in session without your kid’s consent and will help your kiddo explore their gender, not dictate it to them. Beware anyone offering to “explore the reasons for transgender feelings” (read: blame their transness on some trauma imagined or otherwise).
I asked about pronouns, she is still wanting to by she/her for now. Thanks for the advice.
My thought exactly.  
What social pressure is going on at 2 exactly, and carrying on for years afterwards?
To clarify, they said it a few times when they were 2, but this is the first time bringing it up since.
Exactly. Thanks.
Wish my parents got this advice :/
wish my parents was mature for this change, my life is 100% difficult mostly because of the place i live and who won the elections
They said their child wants to still go by she/her for now in a comment
Thank you!
Took me a second to understand ""agab"" and my first thought was ""assigned gay at birth""
Exactly. You learn to spot out the people you'll feel safe and comfortable around. As an adult my friend circles are almost exclusively some type of LGBT.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 We find eachother somehow without even realizing it. It’s not social contagion but making friends with people who feel safe and have similar lived experiences.
Yup. My best friend since kindergarten and I both came out as trans during adulthood. Queer kids gravitate toward each other. It is a real thing.
Thank you!
I second the “no big deal” approach. My daughter did the same thing a around preschool and then again in fifth grade. I recommend just letting them know you’re supportive without really getting overly involved. Let them move through this at their own pace. My daughter settled back into her cis identity by 7th grade.
as a trans man I 100% agree
You are amazing. I appreciate your input.
Parts of your life sound so familiar, but I'm still figuring things out. I started saying I wanted to be a boy at 4, and I'm now in my 30s. The feelings & thoughts never stopped, but I stopped expressing them aloud, became homophobic and transphobic as I was taught while secretly envying them in a part of myself I couldn't and wouldn't acknowledge existed. Because the rules were I was born a girl, rules are rules, and I follow the rules. I've hated myself in ways unrecognizable to most, despite being a highly functional member of society, good friend/sis/daughter, and talented employee/graduate. Because those are the rules: be productive, ignore what you can't be.

The contradictions of homophbia, sexism, and anti-science drove me out of my religious upbringing over several years. I then focused on not being repulsed by LGBT people & actions, because I had to unlearn the hate and become an ally for these people. I'm now coming up on 2 years since realizing I'm one of the people I hated, and it's a new level of sickening. 

OP, I wish my parents had been more like you. There are subtle societal rules & expectations your kid is exposed to by simply existing. We all exist within the rules that are societal norms, and for the most part, they are not malicious,  but societal expectations can feel that way when you don't naturally feel a desire to conform. If I could tell little me anything, it would be that it's ok to break the rules. As long as the broken rule doesn't hurt someone, it's just a boundary, a line that can be crossed or erased or redrawn if necessary. 

I also highly recommend therapy. I just found out that I dissociate, and no, it's not something that everyone does. I still don't/can't think of myself as a ""normal"" person with valid desires & needs. These are things I've thought my entire life. Your kid may already believe similar deeply-rooted negative understandings of themself, and it will take a long time to work through, recognize, and overcome those things. And no, I wouldn't remotely characterize this possibility as anyone's fault or worthy of blame. It just is.
Thank you. Didn’t know that existed.
Thank you! It helps to simplify things and put it in perspective.
Thank you!
Same here.  My oldest, dearest friend who I have known since first grade also turned out to be trans.  Most of my friends I made?  Queer in some fashion.  And I didn’t come out as trans until my thirties, so it’s not like one of us did it and everyone else followed.  We find each other.
Yeah. A bunch of my high school friends came out as trans in college. We went to separate schools, in different states -- for many of us it took years before we realized that half of our old friend group was trans because we were all too scared to tell each other lol. Definitely not something we influenced each other into. Unless they were putting trans juice in the bread sticks at little ceasar's, it seems pretty likely that we just found kindred spirits without fully realizing it was what we were doing.
*sorry,I should have used They,until a decision is made
Thank you!
Thank you! That’s a great way to look at it.
You are right about that. Something to think about for sure.
Thank you!
Thank you. I am thankful that the world is a somewhat safer place for all gender identities. When I was a kid in the late 80s and early 90s, any talk of this nature would have ostracized you from the community. 
I will continue to let my kid explore and figure out where they are comfortable.
Definitely! Thank you.
Exactly. Those are Terf lies.
That’s very well said. Thank you!
5) Ask your kid what they need from you right now. Odds are that if your kid feels strongly right now that they’re a boy (your phrasing was a little ambiguous, it sounds like that’s what you were saying?) then right now, being referred to as anything other than a boy probably feels a bit like having a bucket of ice water dumped over their head. That’s usually what it feels like, especially once you’ve figured out what the problem is. So, on the point of ‘they should not be suffering’, it’s a good idea to ask and be clear about which things you do that are hurting them. If they want to be referred to as ‘him’, then hearing ‘her’ or ‘them’ will hurt, every time. (Don’t do what I’m doing here. The only reason I’m using ‘they/them’ for your kid right now is because you didn’t mention whether they’d specifically asked for ‘he/him’.)

6) Certain lines of argument or questioning might also be hurtful for them, and those lines of argument might sound completely reasonable to you at the time, so you need to get into the habit of asking your kid if the question you just asked makes sense or if they feel like communication is not working right now (just, check in with how they’re feeling when you talk about this stuff), because it’s *always* going to be easier and less painful for them to just end a conversation and run away than it is to actually address the problem. Your kid is the expert here, and for their sake you do not want to get into a situation where they’re afraid of talking to you about it. So no panicking and no getting angry - you need to have your sensible, understanding adult pants on when you’re taking about this stuff. Listen, let them talk. Don’t cut them off, but don’t bottle your own feelings up either.

7) I’m kinda reflecting on this stuff from the perspective of having just mended my relationship with my parents after it broke down when I first came out as bisexual when I was your kid’s age. Let me tell you, eight years is a long time to feel like you have no family looking out for you, especially when you’re a teenager for most of it. I avoided my parents like the plague, doctors and teachers eventually stepped up and filled the gap - three of my teachers ended up filling in the parenting role during the most formative period of my life. All my memories from that period are of them, not my family. I didn’t go off the rails, I did well in school, because of my teachers. Then my grandmother found out I was transgender when I was eighteen and she didn’t ask why or if I was copying my friends (you can safely ask your kid that of course - just maybe don’t ask them the same question once every few days for months like my parents did). My grandmother just immediately started calling me her grandson, and she laughs and apologises the whenever she accidentally uses the wrong pronouns, and it blew my mind that I was allowed to have an actually comfortable relationship with a family member. You don’t have to be perfect or understand perfectly, god knows my grandmother doesn’t understand completely. You just have to try to communicate in a non-combative way, and make an effort to accommodate your kid’s needs. That’s the important part.

8) Okay I’ve been putting this one off because it’s complicated, but. Therapy. Firstly, I’m oversimplifying slightly here because there are specialists your kid can eventually consult about things like hormones and I’m sure there are other similar specialists around, but generally speaking, they don’t really make child psychologists who specialise in gender identity who can assuage all your concerns right now. My dad wanted to look into the same thing, for the reason that he wanted someone to explain what I was going through to me and to my parents, but that’s not really what happens in therapy sessions or discussions with psychologists about this kind of thing. I mentioned to a medical doctor once that my parents wanted me to see a psychologist about coming out as trans when I was seventeen, and my doctor just looked confused for a second and then asked what was wrong with my parents. (I think she actually meant to ask if they’d misunderstood the situation and my needs, which to be fair they had, and that was understandable, but the way she phrased it was kinda funny anyway.) Back to the point: therapy is good for you. Most people even without any mental health problems would benefit from therapy, provided they had a therapist they could trust. If your kid feels that they would benefit from talking to a therapist about it then that’s great because they’ve identified a need they have that you can fill: but the things they would discuss with that therapist would probably be very different from what you’re imagining; a professional who specialises in transgender people might be worse than a regular therapist in this situation (some of them have outdated training or outright hostility to the people they’re treating and you’d have no way of knowing if that was what you were throwing your kid into); and you may well never find out what your kid discusses in those sessions. I certainly never managed to discuss my experience with transitioning in-depth in front of my parents until I was a few years into adulthood and they were less flighty about it.
Thank you for this
Thank you!
The op mentioned that his child wanted to be a boy. That's why people are assuming.
Was looking for someone saying this. This! When talking about transitioning, we can say that we need or want to transition. But you are either trans or not -- wanting to be is beside the point. For a long time, I believed I couldn't be trans, but that was because I didn't want to be trans, not because I wasn't.
I don't buy that considering the ""dad"" occasionally uses they/them. I also don't buy that a child that's been expressing they're male since TWO is fine with she/her. I hope this isn't a case of ""listen kiddo I get you wanna be a boy but you're not so ill humor you with they/them""
Thank you! I was raised in a very far right Conservative and Catholic household. It took me until my 20s to begin to realize how the world actually works. Not going to put my kid through the same thing.
Thank you!
Thank you for the wonderful feedback.
Thank you! It does help to hear stuff like that. It's a lot to work through!
Thank you! I’m trying my best to figure it all out and not offend anyone, especially my kid.
Very true. Thank you for the perspective.
Thank you for this perspective. It really does help.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
I did ask about pronouns, my kid said “she/her” for now.
What???
Terf alert
You were 10 once, you're fully aware that kids aren't ""innocent""

As if sexuality makes people no longer innocent, what bullshit.
[removed]
A real percentage? Yes…it’s roughly 3. Horrible advice here. I would give almost anything to have had the opportunity to transition BEFORE since hormones during puberty greatly affect how your body ends up being structured.
There is nothing harmful about social transitioning. I have known I'm transgender for years, probably when I was 5 or 6 and because I felt like I couldn't present as who I am I did get a lot of suicidal thoughts and while I still get a few suicidal thoughts it has gotten a lot better since I've started transitioning. A lot of people have misconceptions about kids transitioning. Social transitioning is just getting people to use different pronouns or trying out a new name or even just changing your hair. It's very rare for anyone under 18 to transition medically in anyway
I completely understand the desire to do it over the summer - many people who transition don’t want to have to show the whole world what they feel like is an incomplete or imperfect or messy mid-transition version. Have you asked what transitioning means to them, ie haircut, new wardrobe, and if they want to do it all at once and then show up at school the next year as a boy?
Is that because your child wants that or because they're afraid you won't refer to them by their preffered pronouns because I've seen a few comments were you're calling your child by they/them instead. 

Like I'm hoping you actually want to learn or your limit is ""I'll call you anything but he/him""
He wants to go by she her because he feels awkward and doesn’t want to push that barrier yet. You can refer to him as he online…
I never vocalized wanting to be a girl specifically (I am a trans woman). If your child has, it’s definitely some supportive evidence. 

As others have suggested, social transition is a good first step. And making sure they know you’ll support them if and when they decide to take the medical steps!
Worth pointing out like the other person, I started transitioning at 26 and wanted to be a girl from a very young age but at no point did I ever express it to anyone. I think when someone says they're trans, chances are highly likely they are trans.
queer people flock together unknowingly when young and pushed to hide ourselves, source: almost every queer person i know, including myself. the idea that peer pressure makes people gay / trans is almost always false. you surround yourself with people like you, because those are the people you relate to. you do it, i do it, and so does everyone else. its just how we as humans survive in a social environment.
Got it. Still there is corroborative support. Either way it doesn't matter now since it would just be a social transition
The thing you should consider is how many ""regular"" boys or girls tell their parents they want to live as the other gender?  They don't.  It takes a MASSIVE amount of courage to tell parents that you feel like the opposite gender so much that you want to transition.  I child has to be truly amazing to have the confidence to do this.  As others have said right now it would just be social transition, in a few years it will be hormone blockers, and a year or two after, the opposite hormones to match their desired gender.  There shouldn't be any surgeries till they are 18+.

You and your child have plenty of time to go through this process and if they decide this is wrong for them for some reason, they will be able to easily back out without permanent changes.  But its very unlikely.  People and children who realize they are they are transgender and move forward with transition almost always flourish and stick it through.  Those who decide it wasn't right for them, typically do NOT do it because they are not transgender.  They typically do it because they don't get the support they need or society around them is so harsh they feel the need to go back into the closet.

I hope you are awesome and support your child through this.  They need you more now than ever before!  I'm sure you will all figure it out, and they'll grow into an awesome delightful person!
Just see this, if he has expressed this from such a young age, please support him through correct pronouns and social transition, like I said in a previous comment I knew for sure when I was 7, but I’ve always “wanted to be a boy”.
Honestly, if she said she wants to transition at 2 and then brought it up again at 10, then it’s been there for a very long time. I highly doubt that that is the result of peer pressure, because admittedly, around a certain age (8th grade), many of my friends and I all came out. It’s not because one of the people there was queer, and therefore everyone else wanted to be too, it just prompted discussion and questioning. I don’t think many of us were aware that it was possible to be LGBTQ+ before then. 

It’s possible that your kid is going through the same thing. Maybe she has wanted to be a boy this whole time, but only recently heard that it’s actually achievable. Generally speaking, when a child tells their parents that they would like to transition, they have already put a lot of thought into it. 

And as many here have said, most forms of transition at your kid’s age are social (changing name, pronouns, and presentation), so really if she doesn’t turn out to be trans, no harm done.
I never vocalized that I was a boy until highschool. I didn't say anything cause I didn't want anyone to think I was weird and I didn't want them to hate me. 

I think letting them socially transition would be good for them and their mental health, if allowed to socially transition they might avoid some of the mental stress and depression I went through. 

Also, if they bring up puberty blockers and think they would like to have them, they're (the puberty blockers) completely reversible. It just delays puberty. 
If I knew those existed at that age I definitely would have asked to be on them. It would've saved me tons of stress and maybe I wouldn't have been so depressed. 

The most important thing is to listen to your kid, don't continue to missgender them and don't dead name them (use their old name), and let them socially transition if that's what they want.
I wish I'd vocalized how I felt more at these ages. Up until I was 10ish I didn't even understand that transitioning was a thing you could do, it took 10 more for me to face the fear of doing it. I just want to give you kudos for having the kind of relationship with your child that they can trust you like that
If this isn't what your child wants, they can easily retransition back to being a girl; but as others have said, that's not likely the case. In fact, you thought this might be peer pressure from their friend group. I'm inclined to believe your child has this friend group because they were drawn to other LGBT kids. Sometimes people can pick out who is like them even if it isn't obvious to themselves or anyone else. And if it IS just peer pressure, but you still believed and supported them, your child will learn a valuable lesson that their parents will support them no matter what.
Not sure if it’s been mentioned yet but I want to add that just because their friends have recently come out it’s not necessarily a ‘thing’ and they may have just realised that if their friends have been accepted then maybe it’s safe for them to do so as well. Let them experiment with their gender! Even if its a temporary thing it will be good for them to experiment and find out if they actually are trans, if not then they will figure that out naturally and go back to presenting as their assigned gender.
You'd be surprised how possible it is to keep those kinda thoughts secret. I've known since I was 13 (I'm an adult) and STILL haven't mentioned it to my parents once. They genuinely have no idea!

I wouldn't worry too much about it; when you're that young, you can't really do anything permanent even if you wanted to, anyway. Let alone consequences. The worst that can happen is that she tries presenting like a boy the next few months & then loses interest.
Same
oops, my mistake thanks, just looking out cause getting misgendered is reaaallly painful
If only XD
This is correct. I see no problem.
yep. when i met my friend group, we all thought we were cishet. but basically all of us ended up being queer lol
I told my parents “I’m a boy!” at about the same age your kid did. They said “No you’re not!” For my entire childhood I was taught that being queer was disgusting, wrong, that anyone who “chose that lifestyle” would go to hell for it. Meanwhile I hated my body, felt completely disconnected from it, like I was a ghost simply possessing it. Only wanted to play boy characters in pretend. Loved any time someone would accidentally refer to me as male. When I was twelve I discovered what “trans” was and immediately knew I was that. Cue seven years of self loathing and anxiety as I had to stay in the closet, hide myself, cry myself to sleep with a pillow over my head so my parents wouldn’t hear and ask too many dangerous questions. It ruined our relationship. How could I ever trust someone who hates a part of who I am?

Your kid might be trans, might not. For God’s sake, let her experiment, but most importantly, show her that no matter what you are in her corner and her safety and happiness is your priority—whether she’s your son or daughter or child. Please.
man I wish I had a supportive dad* like you are, mine is nightmare fuel and r/insaneparents material. His homophobia only a small part.
You're doing good with your kid, or it seems that way. So many of my queer peers have gone through so much stress and misery due to unsupportive parents :(


*guess based on comment history and statistical probability
I just want to add PFlag is an amazing source for parents of trans kids. My mom used to attended online zoom calls and I think it helped her a lot. She got to hear other parents stories and I think she felt seen. It also is how we found my doctor and surgeon! It truly is an amazing supportive source if you are wanting to attend I highly recommend it.
I struggled with internalized homophobia and international transphobia along with undoing how I was raised and how much hate I had been thought throughout my 32 years of existence at the point where things started to get better. 

Being labeled sick, weak of mind, an abomination in the eyes of god, by members of my family have plagued me since my coming out. 

There is so much damage left to undo and I might never be completely healed from life. 

Hiding/repressing who we are for so long is an inherently traumatic event. Self loathing stemming from what we learn from society, the transphobia/homophobia internalized and externalized, I feel like who I am, my soul has been broken so many times, life broke me in ways that had no wounds on the outside. Dissociating became one of my first traumatic stress responses. I think without feeling numb all the time I wouldn’t be here. I was also the good older child child. I did the things I was supposed to do, I got not just a good job but established a well paying career. I specialized and my talents are slight still to this day. I got married, was in a place where having children were gonna start happening. I was happily married, she was my best friend. I learned so much from her. Her family saw me as their own. 

I cannot tell you how disruptive it is to be all of that and then realize “If I were a girl I’d be happy” knowing exactly what it means, breaking open decades of repressed memories all pointing to trans all along. The loathing the envy, the confusion. It all comes back. The trauma had its was of destroying the happy person I had been and the mask I wore to keep up the facade of happiness was too heavy. 

For me, I was at the breaking point of ending everything, or a try being trans. The Hail Mary of ruining my life by staying alive. 

Therapy. Helped. I learned how to stop dissociating and stay present most of the time now. Reality gets weird but derealizing and depersonalizing is at a minimum. Undoing decades of defense mechanisms comes with a price tho. Most adults know how to handle emotions, good bad, they know how to handle stress and all of those learned skills I never did because of my defense mechanisms…I fell apart. Panic attacks, meltdowns, burnouts. Never experienced anything like that. Un numbing, being real. It’s terrifying.  Therapy helps in that it’s given me the tools I need to cope with all the feelings.

Going from “happy”, angry, numb, sarcasm..

To hrt/expressing who I am as a person and therapy unlocking what feels like every aspect of being alive and the plethora of feelings. It felt like the lights got turned on, the fog of war, of life. dissipated. Smelling a warm spring morning after it had rained that night, brought me to tears. It was the most beautiful moment I had experienced in my life up until that point. I was just walking to work after getting off the bus. It was the first day of my life and I knew no matter how bad it was or gets….this feeling. I liked it. It was worth.

I have wished more times than I can remember to have woken up a woman. I mourn and hate the lost years i could have had being myself as a teenager. I’ll never have my past life back. Those experiences will never be replaced with memories of how I wish I could have been. I’ve cried and mourned that loss as well.

I wish I had loving parents. Actual loving accepting parents. 

I wish that I could have what OP’s son will have. The right life. However hard that would be as a trans kid. It would have saved me, who I am to my soul so much sooner. I wouldn’t have had to rebuild myself from the core up, healing and accepting every broken peace of me from the inside out. 

I don’t think we’re much different at all. Peeling back the layers you sound a lot like me when the gears started turning. It’s never too late to be yourself. It’s expert levels of hard to step outside of your comfort zones to be where you are now. 

It’s never too late to unlearn what feels impossible to unlearn.

For me it was worth it to risk everything. I would have thrown it all away. I would have hurt everyone who rejected me in ways I can’t imagine. Those who are in my life, who accept me for who I am, see me as me and not who I used to be, revealed themselves long ago. They’re a small chunk of bedrock of what used to be a continent of support. But that’s all I needed to be honest. Some are family, most are friends, mostly new friends and the smallest handful of old friends.

My marriage crumbled and I asked for a divorce to stop the emotional bleeding. I married a very straight woman. It’s not her fault. 

My life is better in ways I can’t even express. I’ve found the most amazing love I never knew could exist. 

It’s worth if. 

I can’t recommend doing the hardest thing enough. 

In a sense I killed who I used to be. I’m still very much that person at my core but unrecognizable… those who are gone from my life buried the old me in their minds. I’m dead to them. But how others handle their emotions…that’s not my responsibility. I didn’t make them feel those things. They were in control of how they could have responded how they could have processed those emotions is all on them.

I chose to live. They say it’s like I died and they don’t know who I am. And yet they haven’t tried to get to know me. Oh well.

I had to learn to live for myself. I guess that is a selfish thing. Oh well.

If being happy and alive is a selfish wrong thing I’m glad those bridges are burned and smoldering. 

Anywho. My ramblings need to have stopped a long time ago. 

Choose you. Choose listening to kids(your inner child even) they know more about you than anyone else does. Hold onto and protect that little shard of innocence. It’s the key to making yourself feel whole again.
Glad I could help!
9) If your kid is up for discussing this stuff with a psychologist and you can find one who’s able to discuss this with you or your kid, great - but please remember, you making that offer might sound like you don’t trust your kid to know their own mind, and getting the impression that your parents don’t trust your sanity on some level is absolutely terrifying, so please be clear about the fact that you’re just looking for someone who can help you catch up on understanding how this works and what your kid is going through. Because my dad didn’t think to explain that part to me until four years after he unknowingly scared me half to death and it would have saved a lot of stress on everyone’s part if he’d mentioned that most of his motivation for wanting me to see a psychologist was so the psychologist could sit down with *him* and give him a basic rundown on all the current medical/psychological best practice that I’d read up on and he hadn’t.

10) Your kid’s probably not quite as far ahead of you on the research as I was because I was older when I came out, but the internet is full of obsessive radicals writing hundred-page-long anti-trans theses, and there’s also a lot of completely obsolete medical theory still circulating, so other than talking to other trans people and asking us (which you get brownie points for doing, by the way, that was really good) your options for catching up with your child’s understanding of this situation are limited. Peer pressure is kind of a buzzword but it’s rare in practice in this context, so if you see someone bring it up a lot it’s a massive red flag. *More generally though, the best way I can think of for you to find both information and an insight into your kid’s situation right now, is by looking up guides by trans people for trans people, that talk about the steps of social transition, how to pass in public, what the state of trans legal rights in your country are etc* . That should give you an idea of where your kid is at, and those kinds of guides provide a very realistic explanation of transition for people looking into it for the first time.

Most importantly though, just, keep asking for advice, from your kid and from other people: keep trying to communicate, keep trying to build trust. Be curious. Because, at first I didn’t know that I wanted to be a man - I just got kind of oddly fixated on Legolas from lord of the rings because I was shocked to realise that someone with long hair could turn out to be a guy. I didn’t start wanting to wear a binder out of the blue one day - I bought one because I wanted to dress up as a male alien from a comic for a trip to ComicCon when I was sixteen and I suddenly realised that, dressed up as an inhuman-looking horned alien, I felt more comfortable in my own body than I ever had before. There are probably lots of small moments like that, that your kid has never told you about, and gradually understanding those kinds of things about yourself is fun and exciting, and you as parents can share in that when your kid feels comfortable sharing.

Just, imagine your kid (your son, I guess?) is a terrified rabbit who is internally preparing to run away at all times, and when you’re talking about gender with them it’s important that you make it clear that They Are Allowed To Point It Out If You Say Something Dumb. A lot of potentially hurt feelings can be cleared up that way.

Anyway, best of luck to you two and your kid. Take good care of them, yeah?
But not all boys use he/him pronouns
Yes! It is going to be a lot of work, but believe me, it will all be worth it in the end. I’m really proud of you, good stranger. There will be a lot of mistakes, but just listen to what your kid needs and try to be there for him. :)
Thank you for clarifying - the confusion came from the statement of them ""wanting to be a boy"". I apologise for jumping to a conclusion.
I transitioned over the summer and you're completely right. The point is to be totally different and so people don't see the messy process.
Maybe ease off on the accusations, there. If she was asked about pronouns and expressed that she wanted she/her for the time being, then that's really all there is to it for now. Granted, the fact she's been certain of her gender identity since *two years old* and still wants she/her is kind of wild, so I *do* understand why you're skeptical about this, but OP really hasn't done anything wrong yet, and everybody is different.

If the kid starts asking for he/him and OP still sticks with she/her and they/them, *then* we've got a problem. Not now. 

EDIT: Really? You felt the need to downvote this? OP came here to a trans community and asked us for advice upon their child coming out to them. Could've just not posted at all. It's only fair to give them the benefit of the doubt.
Or maybe OP knows in their heart their kid is trans, and that’s why they switch to “they”, because referring to their child as “she” already feels disrespectful to them, and OP is trying to navigate those feelings. There’s a lot of room for nuance here.
This is probably likely, honestly, but at the end of the day, we *don't* know what's going on in this kid's head. We haven't met her. Everybody is different, and if she says she wants she/her for now, then people *need* to respect that, even if using he/him here seems obvious for us. Same reason as why the egg prime directive exists.

EDIT: OP (and especially OP's kid, if she's here), *please* don't read this thread. The contents are not what I'd call fantastic.
I vocalized wanting to be a girl exactly once in grade 1, realized no one else wanted to be a girl and thought I was weird for wanting to be one so I never mentioned it again for another 17 years
I vocalized it twice, once to my 'mom' and once to my 'friends' in grade school. Long story short I started transition thus year, in my thirties. I started with a lot of regret for waiting, but a lot of that has been aliviated by support from my mom dad and friends, not the 'mom' or 'friends' I had before.
It is incredibly common for Queer people to form groups. People start to figure themselves out in Elementary and Middle school. Having a group who supports you as a Queer person is integral. It's not like one person comes out so they all come out. It's that they're figuring themselves out together. The more space and support they have to do this the better they can figure themselves out. This avoids years of hiding and wondering. Let children be who they are.
Yea. Like one of my friends came out as trans in the 7th grade. We have a group of 8-9. He started to teach us about lgbtq so we all started exploring it and questioning ourselves, all but 2 figured ourselves out, most being pansexual, the other 2 straight. Tho i do know one person that claims to be all sorts of things. Like they change it everyday. They didn't do that until my friend told her about it. It also seems like part of it is peer pressure or she's doing it to just fit in. It is very rare but it does happen. In this case if they mentioned it at 2, than again at 10, support them, take small steps to help them slowly transition to see if they really want it. If they 100% do later on, then take it to the big step with medical
same here. my little gymnasium (german equivalent to middle/high school i suppose?) friend circle turned out to literally be 100% queer, we've been friends for years before coming out to each other lol
I hope you have support now. *hugs*
Thank you very much!
[deleted]
I mean, personally when I came out I felt really weird going by he/him pronouns until I had committed to a new name and cut my hair and I feel like that is probably the case
Nah you’re misgendering him after he said he’s a boy, you’re done.
Gosh I wish anyone would've said ""that's kinda SUS hun"" I might have actually transitioned in my youth 😂😭
You should be supportive of your friends who are still figuring themselves out, rather than assuming they’re doing it for attention :/ This stuff is difficult to figure out and many queer people continue questioning things into adulthood. It’s completely normal. And once they start getting parts of it actually figured out, the rest of it’ll be a little easier. It was impossible for me to figure stuff out until I realized I was nonbinary and aro, then the rest fell into place - I’m not a lesbian or a trans man or asexual or any of the other things I considered along the way. I’m glad that my friends stuck by me instead of assuming I’m a cishet following a “trend” (which it’s not…no one gets cool points for being queer)
Yeah I felt really weird about he/him pronouns personally until I had cut my hair and picked out a new name
It's not misgendering if you ask for pronouns and are given she/her.

What you are doing right now is *actually* misgendering.
They aren't a friend. But ik that if you met this person irl  i think you would see that they are doing it as a trend. I love the lgbtq and dont judge but if i know that its 100% a trend type a thing, it just irks me
we’ll agree to disagree. My perspective is totally different to yours on this. He only feels that way because society made him feel he can’t socially transition yet. It does no harm to say him online lmao… the moment anyone expresses they’re a different gender, especially from a young age I’m respecting that. You know how good it would feel to be called he him without asking? He’s just scared.
She might only feel that way because of social pressure (probably the case tbh), but regardless, if she's more comfortable with one set of pronouns over the other ""correct"" set for her gender identity, then that's what people should use.

> It does no harm to say him online lmao…

It does if she's not comfortable with he/him yet and finds out about this thread. Would *you* feel happy about being misgendered by strangers talking about you behind your back, assuming they know what's best for you?
Yikes, we’re never going to agree. Let’s leave it, I’m still cringing at you continuing to use she when you could say they 🤦‍♂️. They are clearly trans, stop saying she.
She asked to use she/her. Even if it's not what she ACTUALLY wants, it is what she requested and you should respect that.
> she is still wanting to by she/her for now.

Fine, we'll leave it here. All I ask in future is that you don't misgender people when you are *explicitly given pronouns* for that person.

If you think there's only one correct way to be trans, then you have *no* idea what this community is about.
I'm just stunned that someone posting in trans spaces needs to be told the importance of respecting people's pronouns, frankly. Especially the importance of respecting them even when they aren't there. Absolutely unbelievable.
You’re repeating what’s already been said, for reasons stated above I still disagree.
I’m saying there is no harm in using he or they online, she just makes me physically cringe. Adios.
Yeah, it's disgusting. I can't imagine thinking I know better than someone about their own identity.
You should still respect what she has said she wants. Even if you disagree, you're just completely ignoring what the person wants. And she's the only person in her own head.
Just goes to show how far we've still got to go as a society, I guess.
Again, you’re repeating. I still disagree. Lmao…
How disgusting, then.
Hardly disgusting when it’s clear they’re trans and shying away from he pronouns because they’re scared, but okay dramatic one
No. It is not clear. When I first came out, I used my birth pronouns because I was still figuring out what I wanted. If someone had told me I was scared and it was ""clear I was non-binary"", I'd be pissed. You're just ignoring what someone clearly asked for, and you're disrespecting someone's pronouns. You're projecting.

UPDATE: “I have Satan controlling me” *eyeroll*	"According to my parents, someone has been in my ear for a while now. “The world” has been in my ear. Satan has been controlling me and is currently controlling me…  

Conversion therapy isn’t a thing; what it is really called is “conversion”, as in conversion with Christ. What I need is Christ. 

We are having another “conversation” tonight. We aren’t mad at you… We just want to talk. We just want to save our “son”. 

Our pastor already told you the choice that you *need* to make. (I’m aware of that)

Would you rather hate yourself and hate your life, over a choice that you made? You won’t be happy being that way. You’ll lose all of your friends, family, and you won’t have any relationship with a girl…

They are probably praying right now. 

I had to physically walk away from the conversation that my mom wanted to have with me. I was late for class too…"	"Who me? Yeah me and satan go way back he's actually a really nice guy. Helped me change a flat on the m40 and said if I ever need help just dial the satan services hotline and he'd take over my body to cause extremely evil small nuisances to Christian people before changing my tyre for me as payment. Can do it over the net now thanks to devil speak 2.0. Thanks satan :D
This thinking is what makes me hate religion so much. Stay strong.
Pls be safe home girl.
I wanna hug you
Don’t let them decide who you are, stay strong sister
Lucifer says love yourself for who you are, go girl!
It's me, satan, the person that controls you.

I'm out of milk.  Remember our contract.  I control you, so pick some up.  

Also, a dozen eggs and a frozen pizza (not digiorno, they're owned by nestle).

^(jokes aside that's horrible and I hate that for you, and I legitimately hope things improve)
I feel you on this... My family has all but disowned me at this point. They don't even know I'm trans yet... But honestly, I'll say from my personal experience, cutting ties with them and going ""no contact"" was one of the best things I could have done.
According to the Bible itself. Jesus loves everyone. It doesn’t even make sense to their own religion to hate us.
My conversion therapy went so bad that I ended up converting the priest to be on my side
Coming from a religious family this is my worst nightmare if i ever come out to them. I'm still strong in my religion and know that God loves me. But I know so many people have awful experiences with it and it makes them turn away. I hope to one day be the religious support that religious LGBT people need. Please stay strong and hang in, we've all got you back here <3
[deleted]
The fact that they already admitted you wouldn't have a family if you transitioned probably means you should get out of there and cut them off. The friends and shit thing is them trying to further a point obviously and isn't true, but admitting they wouldn't be there for you is basically what they were saying with the whole family thing.

You can find family anywhere else love. Just get somewhere safe please? Start a plan to cutting them off. Like moving or other stuff. Maybe you can go back and see them after you cut them off for a few years but right now you just gotta worry about you.
Christians make Satan sound pretty cool.

I’m sorry you are going through this. Just remember it will get better. You have a chosen family our here waiting for you.
Every time i read this kinda stuff i think ""no way it gets worse""... if i had a dime for every time i was wrong lmaoo
I tried all of that. For decades, I went through therapists, antidepressants, and a whole lot of religion, from Catholic all the way to speaking in tongues Pentacostal. I tried being a total Jesus freak, I tried to pray it away. It doesn't work.
Tell them that using God's name as reason to hurt someone even if the intention is pure is still a cardinal sin because they misused God's name and caused pain with it. This use to be considered blasphemy
Sounds like my mom. I pretty much have cut off contact with her and ignore her pitiful texts. But I’m also turning 30 next month and just started transitioning last April. So I’m where I can cut her out of my life.
It's not religion,  it's people misinterpreting religion. I mean,  I'm quite religious but I'm transitioning and it's nobody's business
Ps I'm not  Religious in the slightest but I have eyes in my head and common sense in my brain
every time i hear the phrase “satan controlling me” i now hear dr doofenshmirtz “i got a platypus controlling me!” song
Be extremely nice to them, make some cookies or something and tell them satan is controlling me to do these things.

In all seriousness, don't play into their narrative, you have your views, opinions and beliefs. If you don't believe in the whole the world vs gods chosen tell them that you don't hold those beliefs. You have your reasons to not hold the same beliefs as them, let them know those.

 At the end of the day what they are saying are just opinions and interpretations of things, this is your life, not theirs. Wish you the best.
Gross. I'm so sorry. Sounds both depressing and obnoxious to deal with.

(And this is also why I waited to move out before I came out ~~because I'm a coward~~)
Religious zealots project so hard
I’m a trans girl and I’m very close to God. Just cuz someone is transgender does not mean they don’t have a relationship with God. ANYONE can be close to God.
My parents are similar, but don’t do conversions

But that’s probably because they don’t know anything about me being trans
Look, don't blame the Devil for a job humans are willing to do.
Same thing happens to me thing is god wants us to be happy and theres no mention of transgender in the bible
I'm so sorry you deal with those...people. I can't really call them parents because they don't fit the standard, and honestly...I'm pretty sure satan would be...nicer than them.
I wish Satan would whisper in my ear. I've been trying to get a hold of that fuck for years
oh lovely, my grandmother also thinks I've a devil in me because of my gender; wanna be satan buddies and burn down a church together while drenched in the blood of goats?
Oh! Satan ? He's a good guy really,  people should always listen to him.  
He's the most accepting being I know,  unlike Jesus.
Report them for child abuse
If you're looking for resources, /r/TransChristianity has a lot of links.

There's also Austen Hartke (AustenLionheart) a transgender man with a Masters in Biblical Studies who has a 'Transgender and Christian' YouTube series.

The only thing I would warn you about if you choose this path, is that not everyone is willing to change their beliefs even when presented with new evidence. The real bias most evangelicals have is ""it's not like me, so it's bad"" and it takes a long time for those thoughts to change.

I wish you luck. Be strong but be safe.
Don't worry, it's a compliment.

Seriously, just look at the bible, Satan is the good guy. Freedom of thought and advocacy for knowledge/logic, vs God constantly murdering everyone who loves and worships him for the lulz. Seems pretty clear cut to me.

Go join the Satanic temple and show them your membership card, it'll be great.
I don’t know how old you are, so that dictates your responses. 

Theology is a slippery eel. Every argument can be countered. You can tell them, “Be careful about scribing to the Devil what is God’s work. God made me this way. God made me trans. Trans people are part of God’s creation, too. There’s plenty of supporting evidence. 

Jesus said not to hurt children. He said it would be better if a stone be hung around a person’s neck and they be thrown into the sea if they hurt someone like me. You’re hurting me. 

Jesus also said our only real job in life is to be good to ‘the least of these.’ He said when you’re cruel to ‘the least of these,’ you’re being cruel to Him. Trans people are the least of any group on earth. Stop being cruel to me. Stop being cruel to Jesus.”

Best of luck with everything. I had to wait until I was out of the house to do anything. Not for lack of trying.

Stay safe and we're all here if you need us.
Don't let them browbeat you and bible-thump you back into not being yourself. Stay strong. Much love sis. 🫂
So you have a made up entity whispering things in your ear, the cure is to trust and give yourselves to another mythological and made up character who too was not only tempted by satan but was crucified in space by him and his demons in early judeo Christian theology? Its sad when Christians dont know their texts or lore yet try to judge.
Welcome to the land of Nod.  Aside from that one bald guy constantly ranting about GDI, it's pretty nice here.

Certifiably antique referential humor aside, it's awfully presumptive of them to want you to turn your back on what God made you to be, in order to be what they want you to be.  If ""God made you just the way you are"", then what God made you is trans, and those self-righteous false prophets need to stop interfering with God's will for you.

(If it's not patently obvious, I absolutely despise the ""Religion means I'm not an asshole because my assholery has divine justification"" mindset...)

How long until you can get out?  If it's reasonably short term I'm half tempted to suggest malicious compliance...revel in the joy of beating them at their own game by going stealth at home (and only at home); having your boobs but wearing a binder \[you'll still know they're there!\], having ""Girl-out Bags"" (stealing the survivalist's ""bug-out bag"" concept) stashed in key places so you can wear a skirt as underwear and then take your pants off when you get to safer spaces, etc.
IDK why people are so down on Satan. Dude brings enlightenment and shows that we don't have to blindly submit to the autocratic terror of a supposedly omnipotent deity. He's more of a friend to us than SkyDaddy ever was.
As a trans Satanist witch I don't see the problem?
Soooooo glad you gave yourself permission to walk away from that TOXIC HATEFUL SHIT!!
God I feel this, although they haven’t gone to drastic measures to convince me that I’m not trans yet. They almost did by financially cutting me off, but thankfully a little bit of lying helped avoid that. I haven’t been able to be honest with my parents for years because of their constant privacy intrusions and lack of care for me and my emotional well being. I’m sorry you’re going through this love, I genuinely do hope it gets better🏳️‍⚧️❤️❤️❤️
Oof. I'm moving out the day after tomorrow, and this weekend my mom looked at my chest and connected the dots of what's going on with me. I'm afraid this is about to happen to me and I'm still under their roof for now, they still could make my life miserable if they want to, I need my father to drive me to the city I'm moving to. It's a 2 hour journey and I gotta take some furniture with me cause I would rather not sleep on the ground and I'm broke. Fuck I hate christianity with all my heart (not christ though, dude was cool)
It's funny, Satanists don't even believe in a Satan. Well, at least not The Satanic Temple. And they'd support you.
This sort of shit is why I am a Satanist.
Satan has a lot of power. If he is controling you, it is without your consent and he owes you. Get something good out of this like boobs. 

When your parents get old you get to choose where to put them. Use your imagination. Let them know what you came up with. These people are crazy.
Forsake your god, worship Baphomet, party with queers, be happy
Christian parents are delusional wack jobs who don't know anything about the real world. I'm hoping for you OP.
Sending big loves and gentle protective hugs
Also, I just want to add (even if you guys don’t believe) that I’m a Pagan that works with Lucifer as my main deity & he has helped me a buttload figure out who I am to be happy with myself. So even if they say that to you - Lucifer literally represents freedom & sticking up for yourself 🖤 

I’ll be thinking of you. Christians have ruined a lot in terms of the conditioning of this world.
Sending my support, I know too many people who go through similar things. This is not acceptable; this is abuse.
Ride the storm out. start a scrapbook of clothes you want to buy.
Imaginary friends is one thing, but imaginary enemies?

Hard to take religion seriously.
Ask them this""why is your god so obsessed with hating others""

Or ""Satan seems like a stand up dude because he accepts everyone, why would I wanna be like you when all you do is hate my existence""
Yep, fellow accused trans satanist here, this all sounds very familiar to my experiences with family.  I’m very sorry that you have to go through that, it’s degrading and fucked up.  You are valid 💕
Sounds like it's time you start exercising your demons (:
My mom thinks im haunted bc I enjoy drawing scary things
Ask them to prove  Satan exists  lol
😂

LMAO i always try to be supportive and helpful in my comments but these ones are also just so funny in a supportive way
I’m really trying… I’m afraid of what might happen if I say that I am “of the world” in a sense.
I hate religion for these reasons too 

Similar experiences
I’m trying my hardest. I just got happy in life for once, because I started my first step with a clinic, and then I also happened to get an 80 in my Anatomy class that I ENDED a 60 with, last summer. I was happy.
Please. At least that would be better than this.
It’s hard to do that… 😅
This!
Hard to do “no contact”, living at home.
HOWWWWW
Damn, you’re like Mega-Trans! This is amazing!
Yes please share!
Thank you.
❤️
😂 Especially my posts over the last few days.
I tried explaining the failure that EXODUS was, but my parents don't want to hear that. They just want their baby boy back...
Exactly. It’s no one’s business.
I explained that this is in fact, my life, but they won't budge. Maybe if my girlfriend (that I am spending time with, alongside my parents this upcoming week) tells them about me, then maybe they'll listen.
I didn't know this was Carrie. XD
Jesus is. People aren’t.
Thank you for the insights!
Gotta love Satan lol

Oh, my girlfriend is helping me out with that idea. She’s constantly pointing things out for me. 😊
Sometimes, yes.
❤️
LOL

They could… Our pastor just preached a series on heaven, hell, angels and demons.
On a serious note though because it does sound it. I had to go along with whatever my parents said until I could get free, fighting it only made them double down and things would get worse. As bad as it felt I had to play their game for many years, and resist their attempts to change me into them. It was worth it for me but its been a very rough ride so I don't blame anyone for struggling. Wishing you some good luck
Understandable. My two most hated words are ""What if"".
Here's the argument you need

So, gender is an immutable (meaning unable to be controlled) part of the psyche. The psyche is one half of the mind, the other half being the intellect. By rejecting your body in favor of your psyche, better known as your soul (ψυχη) you are turning inward away from the world and becoming more spiritual. Why are they rejecting who God made you to be in favor of your worldly body?
It is so tragic these people hate others for living in reality without them
I wish your parents were less cringe. Stay strong
Woot!  As someone studying anatomy right now myself that’s an impressive score!  You go girl!!!
Congrats on your progress and your anatomy score! :)

You deserve every victory and happy moment
i’m sending virtual hugs <3. i’m proud of you and i’m very sorry you are going through this
[removed]
Fair. I sometimes forget that I'm one of the older people here. I do hope things get better for you. But, if they don't, once you're old enough unfortunately moving out and going ""no contact"" might be your best option
I’ve been going through this for the last 5 years. I’ve known I was trans for 7 years now. I’m 22.
Mhmm
What if you hate other words too?
My point exactly, but my pastor denied that.
Thank you.
Thank you. ❤️
Go fuck yourself bot
Dammit bot, I did upvote!
Become independent asap, maybe you could find a group and get a roommate who's trans (maybe a couple) so you can move out and into a space you know will be safe. Right now housings so hard to come by, but if you've got a group of three going in and you make enough then housings actually ""affordable"" if you have a relative who's on your side maybe see if you could go there for now. Your an adult, and your parents can't make you do anything no matter what they say. Don't give them what they want, you deserve to be happy.
Oh I do.  Those are just my most hated.
Yeah well your pastor is full of bull then and is a wolf in sheep's clothing. I'm a theology student and the Bible is really clear here, in favor of the right to transition
<3
He tried to share scripture about being homosexual, but that's not being trans...
And on the note about sexuality, the bible isn't actually against homosexuality, but this is a much more grey area and frankly not worth your time until after you win the battle on gender
Exactly, if you talk to him about it again point out that this isn't about sexuality
If you want to try debating him using scriptures, in r/TransChristianity you can find many useful pro-trans passages, especially in comments
There's literally nothing about lesbians in the old testament because women touching each other didn't matter. Sex outside of marriage was property crime. You were devaluing another man's property, be that his wife or his daughter who he could sell at a bride price. Since women can't get women pregnant it's a non issue. It's the same reason there's no specific statute against a father abusing his daughter. She was his property so if he devalued her there was no one to claim restitution from. God and Sex by Michael Coogan is very interesting on this topic.

The one scripture in deuteronomy about cross dressing I've seen interpreted as a law against men trying to get out of military service or other conscription duties by pretending to be a woman, rather than anything to do with homosexuality. Besides it only mentions wearing clothes, nothing sexual.

Finally Jesus annulled the law or fulfilled it or however you want to put it and said love God and love your neighbor. He repeatedly pointed out that alleviating human suffering was more important than following the law, like healing on the sabbath which would have been a capitol crime. If you're in pain physically or emotionally that should supersede any potential conflicts with the Bible, and there isn't even any clear scriptures against being trans.
On the further on this last one, not only is there not any clear scripture against but there is clear scripture in favor of transitioning if you are trans
Adding on to this, the oft-cited bit about male homosexuality?  Intentionally mistranslated, it was originally a piece about pedophilia...which makes you wonder who wanted that change because the why should be pretty obvious...
Not to be rude, but can you please either send the verses to me, or explain how it's clear?
To add to your addition... 😂 The verses from Paul about not submitting or making others submit to you, that was about the Roman client/patron relationship. This dynamic was an underpinning to much of how Rome ran, but at this level it was basically the prison bitch situation. If you couldn't pay your dues or something along those lines you'd be humiliated by your patron, who would fuck you to show whose boss. Paul was saying don't humiliate your fellow Christians because they're all supposed to be equal. 

Romans didn't have a concept of homosexuality. It was tops and bottoms. If you were receiving you were lower in status. Women could be dominant to men if they were on top, for instance. It wasnt about gender but who was the higher status. If you were a man and the one giving no one would blink an eye. 

It's not really to do with the sex, it's to do with the power dynamic and abuse.
Ive heard that the homosexuality verses were to keep guys banging women for procreation. Back in the day they were tribal and numbers was a real thing. Personally, I think if it were a real problem with spirituality, they would talk a whole lot more about it.
same here
R\*pe as punishment, that's...not beyond horrific or anything. 🤮  

Though I'm a dirty-minded fool giggling at the mental image of some poor scribe taking notes as Paul is ranting about ""Thou shalt not do anything that shalt require a safeword"" (even funnier if it was shortly after he got chewed out for being lousy at aftercare...) and trying to write it down in a way that's tactful.

Makes me think of a lot of the ""Founders' Intent"" stuff in the US, and all the romanticized out-of-context stuff surrounding it.  Their intent was ""We don't like this stuff about the British laws we lived under until recently"" mixed with ""Uhh, maybe we should protect this shit we did to forment revolution so that the next generation doesn't try us for formenting a revolution...""
I have no doubts that's the origin of the whole ""no wasted seed"" thing Judaism has going on...and similarly, that a lot of the rules of Kosher food have origins in bronze-age food safety; the meat and dairy sharing a plate thing is cross-contamination 101, especially given it'd be several centuries before pasteurization became a thing."	t0ddc8	trans	986	0.99	2022-02-24 15:14:13
I USED THE MEN'S BATHROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME	IM SO HAPPY I WAS SO SCARED BUT IT WENT WELL	"Congratulations!!! That's awesome!
Duuude, thats awesome! Its a great feeling to use the proper washroom in public🤗
Oh I remember my first time. It was at a Walmart of all places and me and my brother went together. It made things way less scary. There was one other person in there that looked at me kinda funny but said nothing.

Now I don't even bat a lash at it haha Feels like home.  A much messier, smellier home.
HELL YEAH BRO SO PROUD OF YOU
That's awesome! I'm so happy for you dude! 😁
[deleted]
Man that's awesome
I remember when I took men's bathrooms with zero pass
Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's amazing! I'm happy for you and hope you continue to achieve the things that make you feel happy✨✨
Awww yeah ✋🏼(high five)
Congratulations OP!
WOOO CONGRATS!!
Yeah it’s gross right? Most of the time woman’s bathrooms are a lot less of a nightmare. That’s the main reason why I’m gender fluid./j
IM SO PROUD OF YOU MY MAN
LES GO
Duude sick!! Good for you! Shit is actually SO scary, people usually mind their own business from my experience, gendered bathrooms make me wanna combust. But using the men’s washroom feels really euphoric when you leave.
I used the women's room for the first time last month and it felt so nice.  Yay for you that's awesome
lol, welcome.
That's awesome sooo awesome
Wholesome award for you :D
Congratulations sweetie 😊 I can't wait to finally see the secrets hidden in the girls bathroom for myself
Omg awesome!!!
That’s fantastic! How bad was it compared to the women’s? Like in terms of hygiene? I know the urinals make the place stink
YAY WE ARE ALL SO PROUD OF YOU! ITS SO HARD FOR ME TO GO INTO A MENS BATHROOM YOU’RE SO BRAVE!
That’s great!
Now you can officially join the men's bathroom choir
Honestly I’m getting worried about the pandemic ending and having to start using the mens room. During the pandemic I started growing a beard on hormones and under the safety of a mask.  I still use the womens room because it feels safer and I’m nb so idk I feel like an imposter in the mens room even though I have a beard and got top surgery.  But once masks aren’t normal attire, I won’t have much of a choice because I’ll get more judgement in the womens room than the mens :/ 
BUT IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU FRIEND!!
Hell yeah bruv 🤘🤘🙏🤘👑
Congratulations:)
As a guy I could care less who is using the “men’s” room. Everybody shits. I don’t go in there to make eye contact or hold a conversation. Don’t be afraid.
Awesome. Mine was taking a big fat shit in a 100 degree bathroom under football stadium bleachers during marching band. It was a beautiful moment.
hell yeah bro! this was one of my biggest fears in public for a while, but once i did it i was so happy!
Congratulations man!
So proud of you! I did this for the first time a week ago too and it was exciting (and smelly lol)
Swag
Heck yeah, catboi goals!
Awesome, congratulations! Have a rainbow life!
Yeah you did, and you are pretty fucking awesome!
That's awesome. Congrats!!
CONGRATS
That's awesome! I'm so proud of you 🙂❤️
Nice work dude!
With piss on every toilet seat. Don't make direct contact.
No idea. See transmale doing things, i upvote ^_^

Just did my first injection	"It was so scary, I'm shaking but at the same time I feel so happy I could cry

Sorry I just wanted to tell someone"	"Congratulations!! That’s a huge step. I did my first injection (T) on Monday. I am really not a fan of needles though I’ve gotten my discomfort under control over the years… feels good to know you can do this, right? 🎉
My first time was with my provider at Planned Parenthood and I still feel like it was a dream! I was terrified of needles and now I’m doing thigh injections weekly. (Just took my 25th injection!)

Congratulations!!!
Congrats omg it took me a solid 20 minutes to convince me to stab myself the first time , then tensions unbearable !
Big congrats! It gets so much better so quickly.

My first injection I had to lay down for 30 minutes before I felt ready to go do other things. 

My second injection I had to lay back in my chair and close my eyes for a few minutes.

My third injection I put on the bandage and immediately jumped up ready to go do other things.
Aww you guys are the best I'm so happy I can talk here about such personal things and how everyone so genuinely try to help and encourage each other, I love this community <3
That's awesome! Congratulations, love!
Hell yea! Anticistamenes lete gooo
Congratulations!
I remember the first time I did mine (I hit 1 year back in December) I initially stabbed myself so hard and bruised for a while but I quickly learned. I was also not a big fan of needles but adjusted quickly. Wishing you the best luck!! I am a trans man btw.
Good job!!
I’m happy for you, congratulations!

I still feel anxious with T shots (they’re intra-muscular once a month for me) even after 3 years. If you’re scared of needles the apprehension eases but it’s still uncomfortable even after a while. Overall it takes some getting used to but there’s always a certain fear about getting stabbed in my experience
everytime i inject im always paranoid that i did it wrong and am going to die any second lol

congrats 🎉🎉
Congrats I'm so happy for you
That's so wonderful congratulations!!
we happy for you *hugs*
congrats! i bet you feel great hahah :)))
Happy for you girl!  Enjoy the ride snd I hope the journey takes you exactly where you want to go.
I’m diabetic and over the years guesstimate, I’ve done over, 11,000 injections over the years.  They get easier.
My girlfriend did my first injection for me (switching from patches)! (I have severe phobia and have trained myself up to this by watching her do her own. She said she'll do mine until I can have her do it without fighting back a panic attack.)
Congrats! So proud!
Congratulations keep it going
WAY TO GO, HOPE IT WENT WELL
So proud of you!
Woo!
Proud of you OP! The first step towards greatness and transformation
A huge leap forward like jet fuel.🥰😇
[removed]
It gets easier with time doing the injections, if you have good technique there won’t be too much pain.
I'm so proud of you friend! Giving yourself an injection can be scary but you KILLED it! Nice job :D
Congrats!!!!
Omg, I'm about to start HRT soon, and found out I might get injections, after being told they are not available in my country. So very excited, but also damn scared if I will be able to pull it off. Tell me how hard was it? Did you watch any videos?
Please, take some liver-friendly herbal tinctures with water or herbal mixes in capsules with a good formula made by a chemist's shop. Even when the hormones are taken via shots, it's always good to protect your liver from synthetic drugs and stay away from fried foods even if you're young. 

Frying is a no, no no for anyone who wants to truly have a healthy diet.


Please, also be careful to check if you're not intolerant/allergic to some of the herbs themselves, in my case there are some I always have to ask to leave out of some already made formulas in the chemists' 
Remember: always have a careful supervision by a reliable endocrinologist!
And please, go vegan or vegetarian if you're not yet:-)

Much love from this enby mummy (I mean the real ones with bandages:-)) and stay safe dear!!!
Congrats! Wishing you both no acne and reasonable amounts of butt hair, mates.  ;-)
And grats to you!

It really does feel nice

Before this I was on patches but they never stayed on properly and made my levels unsteady, this is gonna be a lot nicer going day to day
oh wow you're like my hero!

It took every ounce of my strength to not pass out doing it

Thank you!!
Thank you thank you! 

Yea! Even Just looking at the syringe and then pulling the cap off to uncover the needle..
thank you for the encouragement!

I really do hope the next one goes smoother
Thank you!
Wooowooo!
That's really what it feels like, thank you!
oouughuo ... give.. me. Estrogen

Reminds me of a fallout edit I saw on here a while ago

Found it!

[https://imgur.com/qjhW0sg](https://imgur.com/qjhW0sg)

Thank you \^\^, I wish the best to you too
Yea it did hurt, how do I make it not hurt so much? teach me your ways
Wow that's great news! really happy for you! Come on If I can do it, you can do it for sure!

And I swear I watched like 5 different people do it just so I wouldn't mess up, still didn't do it very good :p

It's like 90% mental battle

Here this was my favourite and I'm sure could help [https://getplume.co/patient-resources/](https://getplume.co/patient-resources/)

Also I love your name \^\^
Well I hope I get neither! 

I'm on oestrogen so I don't want any cave hair c:
Haha, thank you! We shall see on both of those… I’d take both if shark week goes away forever though! 😂
Go slow, stay relaxed, drink lots of water before hand, and you don’t have to watch the needle even though you are giving the injection once you are set where you will place the needle.
I mean I usually give myself a shot in my thigh and alternate legs each time. You can try numbing it with cold first but I’m general a smoother motion will be better. If you don’t hit a nerve it won’t hurt much at all. 

Source: I’m a nurse and people ask me all the time how I give them shots that they don’t feel.
Aw thank you, and wow loved the video presentations in the link. Still feels a bit scary, but actually doable. Thanks a millon, and congrats on your first self administered injection. 💞
Oops, sorry. I thought y‘all take pills? How often do you need to inject?  

Edit: cave hair xD
What does oestrogen do to a male-born body? I wanna know because I want to be a woman.
I'm scared I'm going to do something wrong if I'm not carefully overlooking what's happening at all times, but you're right I should probably relax more

I'll definitely try drinking more water next time!

Thank you so much for the help!
You need to like, be my nurse

maybe I'll try an ice pack or something
Yes pills, patches and gels are pretty popular but injections are better for your liver and give steadier levels

what I'm on I need to do it every 4-5 days soooo tuesday-wednesday is my next shot, wish me luck :I
I'm a trans woman. I inject 0.3 ml estradiol valerate every Thursday :D

some inject different things in different amounts at different intervals tho

pills are an option for estrogen but I find injections to be way more convenient and less of a hassle (once you get over the scariness)
Trans women on injections are everywhere 👀
https://transfemscience.org/articles/transfem-intro/

Here you go! For more of the psychological effects or smaller effects, you could look around on this sub for anecdotal posts talking about all the changes they notice
Haha I’m sure that would be fun, I wouldn’t exactly consider myself a battle axe nurse but at work I’m not exactly cutesy.
Oh, that’s a narrow cycle. But that makes sense, we also do injections in order to put less strain on the liver. 

Good luck sis! Thanks for educating me, I def need to learn more.  
Wishing you beautiful non-butt-hair ;-)
Injections are better than pills for your liver, but moot compared to gel and patches. Other than pills it's little other than personal preference. Steadiness is variable, patches for example are completely steady because they are slow release, pills and gel can vary, injections can create cycles if they're spread apart (eg monthly).
I also do my testosterone injections on Thursdays!
Haven‘t talked to many, yet. But it‘s good to know.
Thank you!
And I wish for your butt hair to grow long and bountiful? Like a vikings beard!

jokes aside thank you bro, really

Cosplay anyone?!? So cosplay was a big part of how i found myself, as i have all my life wanted to dress up as female characters. My first cosplay pre-out was D.VA. All the happy feels i got from presenting female made me realize that something was up. Any of u lovely pepz with similar stories?		"(I’m a trans man) I guess so. I’ve been going to cons for a while, and the fact that I never felt comfortable cosplaying female characters, despite me really liking them/their character design made me realize that part of myself. Cosplaying male characters however, always made me really happy, and I would ask my friends to address me with the character’s name and pronouns at cons. I think it was really affirming, and I still enjoy it a lot :)
I cosplayer as Mercy for Halloween a few years ago...the next year I saw a Mercy costume and realized that not only did I want to dress as Mercy again, but that I also just really wanted to be a woman!
Rocky Horror is what did me in.
Ferris from Re:Zero, and then later Rem and Ram.

Whenever I'm able to go to my next convention, I will be cosplaying Stevonnie, and also maybe Poison from Street Fighter.
I’ve been afraid to cosplay at all never mind as female. Now my usual convention is likely cancelled this year so I’ll not get to try it. 

I was going to do Joker from P5 as he had a big part in me coming to terms with myself and then hopefully build up confidence to do a female one next time.
Beautiful !💞💐
You’re freakin CUTE girl!
Cute!!! 😍
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HER!
You are cute as hell
You’re beautiful. When you mentioned dressing up as female characters, I did a double take and had to check which sub this was from.
1) you're adorable 2) yes I'd love to cosplay as a cute anime girl
I recognize that outfit, but I don’t remember where from.
I wanted to do Mordred from Fate/Apocrypha this year at my local convention, of course it was canceled but I'm still wanting to try it!
Same here. 4 years ago I decide I wanted to be Anna from Frozen for Halloween. It gave me a socially acceptable reason to go out in a dress and makeup. That night at my cousin's Halloween party I was happier than I could remember being in over a decade. I kept up the tradition the next few years and last year at Gen Con I cosplayed all 4 days. When I got home and was faced with not being able to go out again until Halloween I realized going out one or 2 times a year and just being my true self in my house on the weekends was no longer tolerable. 

A month later I started seeing a therapist and came out to my parents and am in my 3rd month on hormones. So sad that this yeas Gen Con is likely to get canceled due to COVID
I dipped my toe into cosplay.  The realization that I wanted to cosplay cute female characters and not so much male characters was one more brick in the house of enlightenment.
Great cosplay! You look great! Do you go to any cons? I’m a photographer 😊
So cute
Omg that looks amazing girl! I'm actually similar. Only for me it was theater and LARP. I found myself happiest in makeup and dresses. It made me quite happy when folks would RP or talk to me as a woman too. Even if they were comically surprised when I took it all off xD
I've been wanting to cosplay for years now. My sister in law is  a decently popular cosplayer and I've wanted to join her but I've also been terrified to. Seeing you look so bomb really makes me want to try after all!
Same here
Hatsune Miku got me. I haven’t done any cosplay yet but damn do I want to. It really was the dysphoria that came from listening to Miku that convinced me something what’s up. After that, I just wanna cosplay everyone. I want to cosplay Paxiti’s character, I want to cosplay madoka kaname. Once I start, I’m never gonna stop. You look great, It’s people like you that give me the confidence to seriously pursue cosplay so for that, thank you!
cute cute cute cute cute!!
OMG I MET HER VOICE ACTOR!!!❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I typed it right this time
HOLY SHIT YOU'RE CANON ELIZABETH   


  
And absolutely! Cosplay was the only time I felt like I was being true to myself for years until I came out and started HRT.
I’ve always wanted to do cosplay but never felt like I had the right body or face or talent or really anything you do it. You look fricKin adorable tho 💖💖💜
Hot🔥🔥🔥
Yay, I've just been watching 7DS!

Meliodas is the worst, but all the other characters are great.

I've never cosplayed before but I'd love to cosplay as Diane or Jericho.
You are fkn flawless beautiful like dead gorgeous 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍such a beautiful face with a gorgeous smile
SDS Elizabeth, nice~
One day, I'm gonna be Widowmaker...
""Sir Meliodas!""
You are so hot!!! I love looking at you!!!
Seven deadly sins (forgot the character name)
Oh, Elizabeth! I thought ther person higher in the thread was talking about Bioshock cosplay.

Feeling a little down during lockdown in Australia but keeping myself happy with makeup and clothes! 30 y.o.		"You look gorgeous
Very cute!
Such a lovely young woman. There’s a glow of happiness and it’s not just coming from that shy smile.
You are beautiful!
Gorgeous, beautiful, mhmm, I would add lovely!!!
Beautiful
You look like you’re in your early 20s. I mean this as a compliment!
Fellow Aussie here, I feel you. You're beautiful
Same lockdowns is balls, (sorry if your from Sydney but it’s Sydneys fault Melbourne (me) is in lockdown for like the 6th or 7th time)
You have such pretty eyes!
you are so pretty 🥰
I'm glad I came into this sub. I don't think I was aware of what is possible.

You're beautiful!
Well you look very cute turn, also have the most beautiful eyes
Gladys has really messed this up and every day it’s getting worse. But at least every day you’re becoming more yourself
Yo I have that mouse pad lol. Also you look incredible :)
Hun, you look stunning! Lockdown will not get you down because we are here to support you!
As my dad would say to my mum, ya looking great shiela
There's not just a smile on your lips, there's also a light in your eyes.
Same (from NZ tho)
Wow you are so pretty btw ✨
Thank you! I like the sound of that 😍
Thank you! 🥰
That’s really kind of you! I definitely am feeling an inner glow lately, thank you so so much 💚
Thank you! I am also in need of some adventurous relief haha, I’ve been cooped up inside for too long 😋
I appreciate the compliment so much!! I’m glad I can pretend to be in my 20’s even though I’m in my 30’s 😄 thank you!!
I know right, lockdown sucks so much! 😞 I’m regional NSW I thought I was safe out here, I guess not 😅
Aw thank you!! 💚 I’m going to say it’s the lighting that’s doing all the work lol
Wow thank you 😍 I checked your profile and you look so cute!
I honestly didn’t either but HRT is like magic!
Yay! I love Logitech stuff haha. Thanks so much 💚
That’s such a cute message! Thanks so much ☺️ I love this community
That’s so kind of you to say, but I had to laugh because there literally is a halo light in my eyes that I used for the lighting 😂
Glad I could give you that then ^^
😂very true!!
Damn, that sucks i hope we get out soon, you hang in there
Regardless, they are striking

My birthday is tomorrow and I’m going to be misgendered and deadnamed so much	"I’ve been out to my family for 5 months now, and they claim to be supportive but they just aren’t. My siblings are the closest but they exclusively use they/them for me when my pronouns are she/her, and they avoid any name and gender for me entirely, they literally refer to me as “that person”.

My father said he’d talk with me about it around a week after I came out, but it seems he’s decided to ask as though nothings changed, almost like he forgot. 

My mom is kinda a wildcard, she’s the only one whose ever used my name and pronouns , but she still misgenders and deadnames me daily more times than she’s used my pronouns and real name in total. 

They’ve decided to “compromise” on my name by just calling me “#1” as I’m the firstborn, they’ve only called me it a couple times, but that’s what my cake is going to have on it, and what they’ll sing to me. It’s dehumanizing. 

Can I please just get some well wishes and stuff? My name is Naomi and my pronouns are she/her, thank you !💕

Edit; my mom asked me what we were “going to do with my song” and I replied “my name is my name” and she said “yeah, but I can’t get him to realize that” and she pointed at my dad who was sleeping on the couch. According to my mom he won’t even talk about me being trans at all, and outright refuses to use my real name and pronouns, and my mom has been deadnaming me so he doesn’t get angry. She’s said that we are going to be using my real name, at least as of right now. I’m really happy that I can trust my mom, but it seems my dad sucks really hard.

Edit 2: My parents have gotten into a screaming match and at one point my dad said that I have no friends (untrue) and then asked the question of “what the fuck made him not want to be a boy” so I’m really glad I made this post and have a bunch of really nice messages to read while I hide in my room. Thanks everyone!"	"I'm sorry your family's being a bunch of butts, Naomi. I hope you have a happy birthday regardless, girl.
Sorry you are going through that sweetheart. And Happy Birthday Naomi you are beautiful, sweet, and kind Birthday girl. Sending you wishes, and love. And again Happy Birthday Naomi this is a special day the day the world got someone as great, awesome amazing person you don't ever forget it!!!
Naomi is a very cute name, they’re missing out by not having the experience of saying it
Ok so im petty, I remember seeing a post of someone taking an air horn and blasting every time someone was misgendered or deadnamed.
I'm sorry Naomi. That is very dehumanizing. I hope they come around and realize they shouldn't hurt you like this.
Could you just refuse to blow out your candles/eat with them if the cake says #1? Either way, happy birthday Naomi !!
A birthday girl deserves more respect, im sorry naomi. A number is no way to refer to a lady
Don't let these transphobic people get under your skin. There's no compromise, either you're something either you're not. And you're a girl. Nothing they do can chage that fact.
Happy birthday, Naomi!! 🎉🎂🎉 Hope you have a wonderful life and for you to feel happy! ☺️ Hope you can found people that accept you for who you are. I'm rooting for your happiness! ☺️ And remember the more the time passes less power people who don't accept you will have over you.
Happy Birthday Naomi! 

For SHE’s a jolly good girly
For SHE’a a jolly good girly
For SHE’a a jolly good girly!!!!
Which nobody can deny!
Hey sorry your family is being butts Naomi, maybe try talking with then and ask who the party is for tomorrow? Is it supposed to be for you or the family. If it's supposed to be for you ask them to use your name, even if they think it's silly or don't believe you just make it clear it's what you would want. If they say it's for the family then appreciate the honesty and say that's fine but you want to make your own cake for yourself with your name on it for later.

Hang in there Naomi sending lots of love for your birthday
Hey Naomi, I'm sorry that you're gonna have to go through this on your birthday. It sucks... Hang in there, okay?
Remember that while things might not seem too good now, everything will get better one day. Keep going. You're so strong.
Happy birthday, Naomi 💖
Im sending all my positive vibes Naomi. Happy birthday!!! 
-with much love, from your neighborhood toadman
Air horn, Aztec death whistle, or regular police style whistle. Have one of these, and every time you are misgendered, deadbamed, or when you deem right, blow into it or make the big loud noise.


Sounds crazy, but people are just big monkeys so this should work.
Wear a name tag with your pronouns on it. 
Get your own cake decorations for the cake brute blowing out the candles.
I am so sorry that is going on. Happy birthday and remember what they are saying is wrong and you are who you want to be.
Happy Birthday Naomi! I deal with the similar stupid shit from my family. I didn't put tags on any Christmas presents from me this past year because I wasn't trying to get uninvited from next year for the sake of my baby sister and cousins. I will cross my fingers and toes for you that your family comes around more quickly than mine.
Happy birthday Naomi! I'm sorry you have to go through that, you're a strong woman to deal with that.
I feel this. I currently live with family that still misgender me. Personally, I wanna say what I don't see other people saying: you have every right to say ""its my birthday, and if you're going to call me my deadname and disrespect me then I'm not doing any of this"". Then go spend the day with your friends and ppl who love you! Life is short, and not communicating your boundaries will let people think they can walk all over you. So let me remind you that you don't have to play along with their disrespect girl! Loving yourself sometimes means being mean to people who are hurting you, even if its hard. Either way, I hope you have a magickal birthday filled with all of your favorite things Naomi!! 💕💕💕💕
Naomi, your family sound like arses (much like mine unfortunately) but I hope you have an amazing birthday nonetheless. Enjoy your birthday, and make sure to have the best day  even if its just to spite your family! Keep your head up, because you are a beautiful powerful woman and everyone in r/Trans has your back! If you ever wanna chat w someone, my messages are open sister! - Sloan
Jesus. What kind of family decides to call one of their member ""Number 1"", imo it's extremely dehumanising. 
You deserve so much better, Naomi
Happy birthday girl!
Happy birthday, Naomi! You deserve all the cakes with your name on it in the world!
I very sorry for your family being such cold-hearted deniers. I know I went through this many years ago and my mother was the only one who evidentially came around, but she died, and I'm now left with the rest of the idiots who don't accept me at all. It might be that you will get to where you'll have to say so long forever to them or expect to hear your deadname from them forever. Just stay strong and real. **Happy birthday Naomi**, I know you're strong or you couldn't have gotten this far.
Hey girl! I hope your birthday is better and at least salvageable.. Your family sounds really hard to deal with and I'm really sorry they're have beetles in their goddamn ears.

You'll always have people here that respect you for who you are and I'm sending my love to you!

Also Naomi is such a beautiful name!

Best Wishes and Lots of Love❤️❤️❤️❤️
-Crow
hey sis, i’m sorry you’re family is being horrible to you :/ just know you have all of us here ready to support you to our fullest extent! i hope your birthday goes better than you expect. i understand how hard birthdays can be, ive had mine just a few months ago, the best of wishes to you :)

all in all, happy birthday naomi. i know it probably won’t be as special and as amazing, a beautiful girl like you deserves, but as i’d said before, i do hope it goes better than expected and you get all the gifts you’d asked for. also we will always be here for you naomi 🕺
It like an abuset compromising to not hit your face  but  ""just"" in the guts
Respect gets respect, don't get it in with your name then  roast them hard with a nickname that bugs them! Make it awkward, and do it right when they do it. A doctor of mine, got really upset when after deadnaming me and  I started saying their first name informally in our dialog like we were old friends
mine is today and i'm going to see my fam on friday. i feel you
Omg do we have the same father?! Anyway, happy birthday Naomie, I was in the same situation as you, remember that they will probably eventually call you with the right name and pronouns, and if not, you can find a second family who will love you, everybody have their place in this world!
Happy birthday Naomi! I wish you a very good birthday!! :))
My goodness your story sounds so much like mine. Except none of my family would ever name/gender me correctly. My birthday was last Friday and every card was addressed to my deadname
Happy birthday bestie!!! I'm sorry that you will be misgendered on your birthday. You are a unique and you deserve to be happy. Remember that your validation comes from within and i appreciate you and I'm happy that your birthday adds another year of your beautiful existence ❤️
Happy Birthday Naomi!!! I wish you the best of luck!!!!!💖
Sorry you have to deal with that :(
Aw come on, don't listen to them Naomi. You are valid. You deserve to be respected. I really hope you're doing well, and i hope you have a happy birthday!
Happy birthday Naomi!  Keep being amazing and don’t let your family get you down.
Happy birthday Naomi, I'm sorry to hear your family are being awful.
Send you all of my love and support Naomi. I hope it will be better for you one day 💗
Happy Birthdays Naomi! I'm so sorry your family are celebrating some number on your birthday instead of you

it really is a shame when families are so wrapped up and stuck in their ways instead of just recognizing and acknowledging the amazing young woman they have right there... lots of love darling <3

P.S. super cute name btw
Wishing a happy birthday to Naomi because she seems really cool and I hope her birthday is great. I know I phrased that really weird but it was the only way to fit in she and her.
Happiest soon to be birthday Naomi🎊🎉☺️!
Naomi; it sounds like they aren't transphobic, but are having trouble coming to terms with the change. You need to sit down with all of them and properly explain who you are and who you want to be. Tell them your pronouns and name, and correct them *every* time they get it wrong (that includes they/them or #1).

My mum quite often misgenders/deadnames me, but it is genuinely because she keeps forgetting. You've just gotta keep correcting them, even if it becomes annoying. I hope this helps. Good luck, sis! <3
That's a beautiful name Naomi
Happy birthday, Naomi!! I hope you have a supportive community to celebrate with and I wish you the best, my gal.
Hey Naomi! Happy birthday! I know how much it sucks to be deadnamed every day. I’m coming from a similar situation. I hope everything goes well!
Happy birthday Naomi! Your family is acting like a bunch of jerks, but r/trans always has your back <3
I'm sorry to hear about your family Naomi. You should let everyone know you don't want anything for your birthday except to be called by your true name and gender.

And there's nothing wrong with correcting them when they do wrong. Maybe they'll get sick of it and finally change what they call you. 

Oh, also Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday Naomi, try to tune them out during the song and make that wish when you blow out the candle :)
Time to make a scene.
I'm sorry this is happening Naomi, I hope things change for the better girl, even if you have to kick and bite to make it happen.

Just correct them every single time they do it, be difficult, give no ground, and hopefully they will eventually they'll give up the old you, if only to get you to shut up about correcting them.
Happy birthday Naomi!! It's fully on your shitty ass family to not love you for who you really are, it's their loss for not being able to enjoy and cherish the real you.
You are me... same birthday and situation, happy early birthday though!
Whenever someone (who I’ve came out to) misgenders me I just exclaim loudly “WHO?” Until they get it right
Naomi is such a beautiful name! ❤️ you deserve to be treated as the beautiful woman you are. I'm sorry your family is coming up short. You're loved and valid no matter what.
Happy birthday Naomi, it's unfortunate that you have to go through this, but one day it'll all be behind you. If you ever need someone to talk to, whether that be that day, or whenever, I'll be here. Hope we made your day better Naomi, even if it's just a bit.
Ah your name is cute Naomi I’m sad to here that your family doesn’t use it more I hope you have a great day anyway girl! Your amazing and totally valid I hope they come around to realize who you really are. Happy birthday :) <3
Happy birthday Naomi! I hope the day goes by quickly and that you can have a fun celebration with your friends another day! You deserve much better than all this bullshit.
Happy bday, Girl! Man I'd make you a birthday card but I don't have any one me, and all my pens fried up as I was drawing. But hey, Naomi, don't give up! Don't let them make you feel down, your birth day is only happening once a year! They shouldn't put only #1 on that cake, they should write;

""Naomi, happy birthday, #1 girl on earth!""

Now get yourself some cake and be happy! 

Smile, it's your birthday! 

Live and love,

-Isabelle
I'm so sorry you have to go through that.  My family misgenderes and deadnames me all the time.  I get it, it's like being stabbed with a tiny knife over and over.

If I was in your situation, I would flat out just not be there for that party.  Go out with friends, come way after they are in bed.  Then post pics with my friends all over social media tagged with your name and pronouns.  That's what I'll most likely do for my bday.
happy early birthday naomi! i hope it goes well despite this horrible bit. im glad they're somewhat ""compromising"" most families would just say no right off the bat. maybe by next birthday they'll be singing your name~
Happy early birthday, Naomi. They may not be celebrating with you, but we'll happily celebrate your birthday tomorrow.

However, today we would like to celebrate the unbirthday of the wonderful young woman that you are, Naomi!
Your birthday is very close to mine, mine's on the 15th. I feel your pain my family refuses to even knowledge me being trans unless it's to make fun of me.
Sorry for a family like that, it made me feel horrible when my brother was saying stuff about me being bigender, I think he is sexist, and half of my family dose not know, but it sounds like your family just sucks, all of them
Horray for the beautiful birthday girl, miss Naomi!!
Happy Birthday Naomi!
My dad is the same. He claims to he supportive but bearly uses my name and pronouns
Happy birthday, Naomi!!!
Naomi is a beautiful name, and you have a happy birthday baby girl. ♥️♥️♥️
*Thats my name give it back*

Jokes aside, happy birthday Naomi from another Naomi! You got this girl, pull through aight?

A g e
Girl we have the same story basically except my sisters been supportive so I can’t pretend to relate there, but I know exactly what you’re feeling and that saddens me. It took about two years after I came out to my parents before they were ever able to have a conversation about it

I am here to tell that things get better, like I said my parents like yours claimed to be at first but weren’t, but I’m hoping for your sake that like my parents your parents will come around, I learned that sometimes they really do care and are supportive but it takes them time to process things, it’s not fair to us but people are people and that’s what it is just keep trying to be the bigger person, you will feel so much better in the long run when they come around and through out that journey. Obviously I don’t know how far along you are in you’re transition but I’m also telling you my story because I’m assuming that you aren’t that far yet and a piece of advice I would like to give is please don’t let your family’s lack of support hold you back like I did, I wasted so much time, I came out to them when I was 20 and didn’t start hormones until I turned 23 and I’ll be 25 end of this year. I wasted three years just getting on hormones waiting for their support. 
Things will get better, you will find your people and feel loved, I can assure you of that. 

Happy Birthday Naomi! 🎂🎉🎈
  -Love, Kayla
HAPPY BIRTHDAY NAOMI!!!🥳🥳
I'm sorry your family is being sucky and I hope they aren't  too bad
You're awesome and brave and regardless of how others treat you, you are valid and amazing in who you are🥰😍
People think they're being gender-neutral by saying ""child"" or ""#1"", but they're just being dehumanizing.
I’m sorry, Naomi. Totally not your fault that your dad is struggling with this. That is his problem. Perhaps your other family can sing your real name and if your dad says something else he will realize that he’s the only one being stubborn? I know that’s hard but I hope your mom can help you more by using your real name. I understand being afraid of the anger. If you are all safe of course, I hope your family can help stick up for you because you deserve it, Missy!

Edit: I’ve also always loved that name it’s so pretty!
As someone else who's birthday is today and is also trans, I feel you Naomi, birthdays can be painful when deadnaming and the such is happening :/
I hope you try to have a wonderful day outside of those situations
Happy birthday Naomi <3 coming from a fellow trans (15, ftm) member, if my family was going to refuse to put my correct name on my cake I would uninvite everyone and buy my own cake with the correct name lmao. they’re missing out on celebrating their daughter and their sister’s birthday. I hope it goes well and remember you’re always going to be and always will be the lady you were meant to be
Aww that sucks, I k ow how you feel

*hugs*

Happy birthday Naomi!
Happy birthday Naomi! Birthday girl! I'm so sorry your family is being awful! It sounds like the type you need to go no contact with when you're able.
Your birthday shall go well i hope…
Naomi you deserve to be treated like a princess, because you are one, happy birthday!
1st happy birthday Naomi,

2nd IMO you aren’t obligated to stick around you could leave or refuse to interact with anyone unless they use your name. If you gonna be dehumanised, you might as well ignore them like “An aNImAl”

Whatever you do, just remember you’ve got more people than just your mum on your side
Wait is ""that person"" rude? I always call people that to avoid misgendering anyone who may secretly be trans...
Aw Naomi 🥺 I really wish there was a way I could help you, that sounds like a terrible thing to go through. Hope you get better girl ❤️‍🩹
I really hope your dad stops being horrible and realises that he's making you dislike him. Have a lovely birthday Naomi, me and my little sloth will have you in our thoughts 😊
parents are really weird ... im basically in the same situation .. but i gladly only see my parents 1x month or so 🙈😅
my mom is like ""youre not a real girl yet so youre still my son""
Absolutely wild.. Imagine taking away someone's name and giving them a number as a 'compromise'

Sorry to hear about all this chick..
My birthday is today and im going through the exact same thing, im sorry you have to go through this. Sending hugs and support!
Happy birthday Naomi!

Turns out you have the same BD as my dad! Lol.

Hope those butts realize that you are a girl, Not whatever else.

Also, I love the name Naomi XD
i'm so sorry that this is going to happen to you, i really am, i know how much it hurts to be misgendered by someone that you're already out to. i wish you well and i hope your birthday doesn't suck that much, i wish you well Naomi!
If you have any friends go to their place for the day. Nothing sends message like letting them know that you hate being treated with no respect like telling them that you'd literally do anything else but be around them on your birthday.
Hi Naomi, I'm sorry your birthday isn't looking that promising at the moment. I hope it turns out better than expected, girl. 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈
This sounds semi-similar to my situation. My dad isn't ""ready"" for it yet so my mum and my brother still mostly deadnames and misgender me. It's why I haven't told my extended family yet despite having come out at work and to my friends and having full support there ...

Idk what to do tbh. I just kinda know what you feel, Naomi.

*hugs*
Happy birthday to you, Naomi! I’m wishing you the absolute best on your journey with your transition 🎂❤️
I'm late to the party since I only woke up to a notification of this particular post today, but being disrespected and dead named (or numbered) to your face constantly as well as on such an important day isn't right to anyone, happy birthday Naomi, and best wishes! I hope all goes well!
I am sorry u are going through this Naomi, i wish you the safest, comfiest and happiest birthday. know that there is ppl out there that dont compromise and accept you and love you as you are 💞🏳️‍⚧️
Tbh I feel like it's pretty likely that everyone in your family was trying not to piss off your dad, hopefully he realizes quickly he is making a huge mistake by not supporting you and getting angry at others for doing so. Happy birthday 🫂
On a day when you’re supposed to be the birthday bitch they the ones being bitches. Hbd Naomi I hope things gets better for you. You shouldn’t have to put up with that shit.
I am so sorry your family is treating you that way. You do not in any way deserve to be treated poorly. If it means anything, we are here for you. Happy birthday Naomi.
hey naomi, happy birthday!! i’m so sorry to hear about your family— mine does this to me, and it sucks. it’s YOUR birthday, not theirs! my advice is: have your own celebration either the day before, earlier in the day, or the day after. my family subscribes to the birthday month, and i use that as an excuse to go hang out with my friends as much as i possibly can— we go on roadtrips, play video games, watch movie marathons, feed our dogs puppacinos and just generally hang out and have fun. it’s also really good to have like a birthday activity you really look forward to— i’m a huge science nerd, so i drag people to museums on my birthday. just try to have fun, and not let them get you down— you’re the birthday girl, and you should have the best time imaginable!
Ngl calling you #1 is kinda dehumanizing
Sorry if this isn't really relevant, but I love the name ""Naomi"", it's really beautiful, I hope you can have a happy birthday despite of this, Im sure u are a beautiful girl. ^^
Happy birthday, Naomi!

Everyone, wish her a happy birthday!

Naomi, (lovely name, BTW) it sounds like your mom is trying to get your dad to come around diplomatically.  He’s probably struggling with “my first born son” issues and is having difficulty coming to terms with the idea of “first born daughter.”  It takes time with men brought up in male dominated society and the idea of “now I can raise my little boy to be just like me.”

It’s good that you have a supportive mom and that she’s trying (even with mistakes).  It will take time.  The best thing you can do is to just be you and lead by example.

Also, don’t respond to your dead name.  If they keep using it and get frustrated with you.  Simply say, “Oh, I’m sorry.  I thought you were speaking to someone else!  Hello, my name is “Naomi!”  I’m very pleased to meet you!”
Naomi's a beautiful name though...
I never understood the point of view those kind of people 

Stay strong ♥️ and happy birthday 😊
i’m so sorry naomi :( happy birthday girl!
Happy Birthday Naomi! Love the name btw my Name is Joey/Jade either one, hope your birthday is going well
Happy birthday Naomi!
Happy Birthday Naomi!
i'm on the same situación, so yeah, It sucks
Happy birthday Naomi!
I know this feeling Naomi and I'm so sorry you have to go through it, nobody deserves this type of disrespect
happy birthday Naomi 🎉
I had the same sort of issue, but I'm not out yet. It's hard, but I'm sure you'll get through it. If you have any friends or a partner that will use your correct name and pronouns, I'd probably try and hangout with them somehow. It would be reassuring. Good luck at the birthday party :)
Happy birthday Naomi. I’m sorry you are going through this. Do you have any friends that live nearby you could stay with?
Happy birthday to you, Naomi, I'm sure you're an amazing woman and you definitely deserve better than this, I wish you health and better people in your life, that will actually admire and be grateful for you 🫂💜
Happy birthday girl!!!!
Just leave the horrible family members behind and move on. It's hard I know but ive done it before and it's very freeing. If you can't move out then act like they don't exist. If they can't treat you right then why go through the trouble of dealing with them? Put your emotions and feelings on hold and say fuck them and move on. Yeah they're family but it doesn't make a difference. Toxic is toxic. Family doesn't get special treatment.
happy birthday naomi, so proud of you sweet girl :) you'll get through this!
Happy Birthday Naomi
[deleted]
Dont know whats the right thing to do in that situation so im not gonna risk telling u any bs. 
I can only tell u that im sorry for ur struggling! <333
Happy Birthday Naomi! I hope your birthday kicks ass!
You're family's being assholes right now and I'm sorry for what you're going through. You'll get through this, and happy birthday, Naomi! <33 I don't know if you'll get this reference, but you're a mermaid. They're just shrimp. Don't listen to the opinions of shrimp. Have a great day and many more to come.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR BIRTHDAY TWIN
First, Hau'oli la hanau, Naomi!

Here might be a cheeky way to answer your Dad's rude question: ""Well, Dad, since I got half of my genetic material from you, there's at least a fifty percent chance *you made me this way.*""

And smile sweetly while you say it, but be ready to run.
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO NAOMIIIII!!🥳🎂 HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!

Thank you so much, it means a lot!❤️
Thank you!💕
Ong such a cute name
I’m tempted but if I’m way to non-confrontational to do that, I’m tempted to only call my parents by their legal names though, but legally I’m named after my dad and I don’t wanna be saying my deadname all the time. The nuclear option would be to refer to everyone by their SSNs. My parents are incapable ~~for~~ of filing taxes so they make me file their taxes, I’ve got all of them.
Mine would be to bring a bunch of pennies and a jar. Each time they get it wrong, I put a penny in the jar. Each penny would represent one (1) dollar I will donate to Planned Parenthood. My parents are hardcore catholics and so they hate Planned Parenthood. Think this would be a good motivator??
Thank you! And I hope so too!
Happy cake day 🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂
I could do that, but it would make a scene and I hate confrontation, and I hate the spotlight. Like when I came out my mom tried to convince me to not be trans cause “everyone will be staring at you”. I’m tempted to make my own cake just so I can put my name on it.
Thank you so much!💗
Thank you so much!💕 I have a very close circle of friends (2 of which are also trans, just not mtf) and they help a lot!
Thank you so much!💕 Your song has me with the widest grin right now
I still live with my parents so we aren’t really throwing a party with alot of people, it’s just gonna be my parents and siblings (both of which also still with my parents). Thank you for the idea though!💜
Thank you, I’m trying!💕
Thank you so much Toadman!🐸💕
I’m tempted but I feel like that would only result in me being screamed at or something. I might do that when I don’t live with my parents anymore, just in case.
Thank you!💞
Yeah, I don’t think my immediate family (except maybe my dad) is outright transphobic, I think they just don’t realize how big of a deal it is to me. Thank you and I hope your family comes around too!
Thank you!💗
Thank you so much!❤️ I really need to work on being more assertive, but I’m really shy and I don’t want to “rock the boat”. If it gets really bad tomorrow I might try and do what you suggested!
Thank you so much Sloan! I didn’t expect nearly this much support, it’s amazing!💕
Thank you💕! I thought I was overreacting about it when I saw “#1 Birthday” on the calendar and started crying, it’s great to see that other people find it as ridiculous as I do!
Thank you!💕
Thank you so much!💞
Thank you so much! 💕
Thank you so much!
Yeah, that what it feels like, and even then they still hit me in the face (metaphorically) all the time. Like my mom literally sat next to me while I cried about how much I hate being called by my deadname, but the next day she was still using it. And this was well over 2 months ago
I would love to do that, but my parents are kinda stupid. It’s one of those “it’s fine when I do it but not fine when you do it” kinda things, they’re massive hypocrites and don’t even realize they are hypocrites. I have been tempted to do it thought, and since it’s my birthday I just might!
Well in that case, Happy Birthday Beautiful! I checked your profile just to double check pronouns and I saw your selfie, you are actually really pretty, at least to me! Yeah It’s also great to find another transfem one piece fan!
Thank you! I have a very close knit group of friends that I already consider a second family (even if I haven’t told them yet)
Thank you!💞
I’m so sorry, hopefully both our family become better eventually!💗
Thank you!💞
Thank you!💜
Thank you so much!💜
Thank you!
Thank you!💗
Thank you!💞 and I hope so too!
Thank you so much💜! And thanks for the name compliment, I picked it out myself (lmao)
Thank you! And it wasn’t structured that weirdly, and an even bigger thank you for working in my pronouns!💗
Thanks for the advice! I’m going to try and do that!
Thank you so much💕! I picked it out myself, lmao
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you so much!💞
Thank you so much!💜
Thank you so much!❤️
TYSM!💕
Thank you!💗 I’ve thought about doing that but I really dislike conflict and the spotlight, so while I think about doing it I probably won’t be
Thank you so much!💜
In that case, Happy Early Birthday to you too beautiful, hopefully our day is better than we think it is!❤️
Lmao, that’s a great idea! I might try that! Thanks💞
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you! All this support is really helping!💕
Thank you so much😊
Thank you!💕
Thank you so much Isabelle!💕
That sounds like a great idea, it’s too bad my friends either have work, school, or just live too far away. I will definitely have a late birthday celebration though! Thank you!💕
That’s what I’m hoping! Thank you💕!
Thank you so much!💕
I’m so sorry, my family has at least mostly chosen to ignore it, I’m not outright made fun of. Happy  Early Birthday handsome (I checked your account for pronouns and saw your post about a binder, I really hope you are okay with being called handsome, if not I’ll edit!). Hopefully your family gets better, and if not I hope you can at least find a second family that loves you for who you are!
Yeah, I’m particularly worried since my family is much more accepting than my cousins, they legit might try and hurt me if they knew. I hope your family grows to accept you!
Thank you so much!❤️
Thank you!💗
That sucks, hopefully both our dads get better!
Thanks!💞
Thank you so much!💜 it’s really cool to meet another Naomi, our name isn’t one of those super popular ones, but it’s a really good name!
Thank you! My situation is kinda weird, I got my hrt through Folx and so I was able to kinda do it under their noses, but I came out to them around 3 days after I started. I’m currently 5 months on hrt and my egg cracked almost a year ago (closer to 11ish months ago). So I’m still pretty early in my transition but I definitely won’t let them stop me! I’m really glad your parents finally came around, and I definitely hope mine come around too!
Thank you!💞
Thank you so much! And I really hope he’ll get more used to the idea, I think part of the issue is that I was supposed to be his “namesake”, like my name was [my dad’s name] II, so maybe he’s upset about that or something. I’m really hoping he doesn’t make a scene or anything.
Thank you! And I hope you have a happy birthday too!💕
Thank you so much!❤️
Thank you!💜
Thank you!💕 I’ve debated going no contact, I should be finishing my degree by the end of the year, and me and a friend (another trans person who’s parents aren’t great, but they’re in the closet rn) are planning on getting an apartment or something. For me it all depends on if they get better or not by then, if not then I guess it’s no contact for a bit.
Thanks!💛
Thank you so much!💜
Thank you!💕
It’s more dependent on how they say it, we were playing Minecraft and they were using it as a way to avoid saying any name for me, cause while they don’t wanna deadname me, they also have never once said my real name. I respect them for trying but when you’re just hanging out and they say “where is that person” and you’re sitting right there. It’s more about them refusing to use my name
Thank you!❤️
Thank you! During my rant to my mom last night I did tell her that he’s making me resent him, I’m not sure if she’ll tell him that or not though. I’m hopeful he just needs a lot of time, he’s a nearly 60 year old army guy (was never active duty) who worked in construction for 30 years, one of the most typical mans mans there could be, I can kinda get him struggling that his “son” is now his daughter
That’s horrible, I hope your parents come around eventually!
Thank you! I probably should’ve said this in my edit but I did tell my mom I find the #1 thing dehumanizing, so hopefully that’ll stop now
Thank you! And happy birthday to you too!💛
Thank you!💕
Thank you!💜
I’m tempted but all my friends have work or school today and I don’t have a car I can use (we’ve had some car issues and the spare I normally used fully died) thanks for the suggestion though!💗
Thanks!💕
That terrible, hopefully both our dads stop being butts!
Thank you so much!💜
Thank you!❤️
Thank you so much!💗
Thank you! I really hope so too!
Thank you!❤️ I’m hoping they get better with time!
Thank you!💕
Thank you so much! I am doing some stuff with my friends on my birthday, I’m running a short DND session in around an hour and half, and I’m really looking forward to it!
Thanks, I thought so too but was worried I was overreacting
Thank you💛! And even if it isn’t entirely relevant it’s so nice to hear I have a pretty name!
Thank you so much!💗
Thank you!💜
Thank you so much! I really like your names too! I’ve got a friend who has 2 first names kinda like you!
Thank you!❤️
That’s not great, hopefully both our family get better
Thanks!❤️
Thank you!💛
Thank you!💜
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you! And I kinda don’t, 2 of my friends live too far to walk (I don’t have a car rn), and the other 2 have work or school. I am going to be playing some DND with them eventually though, so that’s going to be fun!
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you!💗
Yeah, I kinda plan to do that, I’m basically trying to keep my head down and just finish my schooling (online college bachelors courses) and once I’m done I plan to move out with a friend, and unless they get a lot better by then I plan to go no or extremely low contact with them
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you!💛
Thank you so much!💕 I’m really hoping they get better, but if not I guess I’ll just have to cut them out of my life
Thank you!💜 I’m really hoping things get better over time!
Thank you!💜
Thank you!💕 and have a happy birthday too!
Thank you!❤️
A delusion is literally a medical term used by psychologists, and psychologists themselves acknowledge that trans people are not under a delusion, we are an exception. Might as well just start calling me out for illnesses I don’t have
Bold of you to assume I’m getting buried
I mean, I’d hope so? I think you’re a bit confused

Edit for context since this comment is guaranteed to get removed they said “they will use your real name when they bury you”
Do you have any plans?
Anytime Naomi, 😊. If you ever need someone to talk, vent or what ever just dm. We sisters stick together
Naomi is my most favorite name! As a kid I always named my dolls Naomi. I want to be your friend so I can have a friend named Naomi! So pretty!
Oh PLEASE do that, that would be hilarious.

The way they are dehumanizing you.. That's not ok. I'm sorry you are going through this Naomi.
Happy birthday honey, I wish you well
Or you could call your mom incubator and your dad gamete giver
Stand strong, madam! Not one step back!
You can also refer to them with the wrong pronouns anytime they misgender you. If they speak up about it, be like now you know how I feel
Sounds like the ultimate motivator
Definitely do that!! You could even decorate it with the trans flag maybe? It would be a good moment to explain how hurtful what they're doing is
Happy birthday sister. May it be another step closer to freedom <3
You can tell them that you won’t attend if they misgender you.
:D <3
It is ridiculous. This is obviously not about them not being able to adapt to your new name.

This is them denying you the basic respect you're owed by adapting themselves to a derogatory term they consciously chose to use to refer to you.

I struggle to see this as anything other than transphobia.
i seen your update, i’m really sorry that happened, i hope it gets better buddy
>Yeah, that what it feels like, and even then they still hit me in the face (metaphorically) all the time

Ye abusers don't often stick to their own made ""compromises"".

I think refuse the cake you are not a number or an no name, ignore them if they don't say your name or pronouns etc that often works. But just do it if you are not at risk of physical abuse.
girl my jaw dropped after reading that, thank you so much for the compliment! also i agree it's always nice (and also quite unexpected) to meet another transfem One Piece fan. happy early birthday, sis! :D
Lol that's what I always say too
I guarantee you'd feel great for getting it off your chest instead of silently dealing with it. 

Of course you should only do what you're comfortable with, but it won't stop accidentally.
Thank you!❤️
Lol road trip!
Thanks, and Happy Early Birthday to you :)
That sounds like a good plan! No better roommate than a fellow friend of blahaj.
Naomi is suck a pretty name btw
Oh that's annoying I would make them pay me everytime muahaha
Yeah, it sucks that being transgender isn't really widely discussed in a neutral sitting and people that are ignorant don't want to learn, the world would be a lot better if people would just educate themselves on people. I'm kinda going off topic here but it drives me insane that people think that we chose to be like this and judge us based on that. Who in their right mind would choose to be judged for literally everything.
Np just don’t get your hopes up. Cis folk just don’t get it.
You're very welcome. You are a valid and loved human being. Anyone would be lucky to be your friend.
oh, that’s awesome! have fun!
Yes u do! ^^
ofc <3
Thanks only a few of my friends know about the two first names haven't told my parents though I'm thinking about it. Hope your doin well! 😁😋
i hope so (:
Sorry about everything your going through 😔 but remember it's still YOUR day! 😊
The first weeks are always the hardest leaving family behind but it gets a lot easier after.💕
I bet they will. Stay strong <33

Not really, I played some DND with a friend earlier, but aside from that no
Thank you so much! That means a lot, and I’d love to be your friend!💗🥰
Birther and donor
I would but I live with them, so that isn’t really an option, we are also having car troubles right now so I can’t even drive away. At best I could walk somewhere but I can’t make it too far
I am a grown adult and my parents are getting old, if it came down to blows I’d easily win (though I’d much rather it not come to that), so I’m in no threat of physical violence at least. Thanks for the suggestion! I might do that if they’re particularly bad
>Thank you!❤️

You're welcome!
Lmao, that would be a really fun idea!
I have been tempted to make a deadname and misgender jar, but I’m worried that my dad wouldn’t care and wouldn’t pay, so my mom would “cover his tab” basically. He used to have a problem where he’d “borrow” our money and never give it back, and then my mom would give us some of her money to “pay his debts”
I 100% agree, this world would be far better if people were just more willing to learn about those around them
🥰🥺
I see what you mean, I thought you were being transphobic about the whole deadname on tombstone thing. Sorry for assuming! And you make a good point, I’ve gotta stress this just in case something happens.
That’s still a party.
That ducking sucks

Wow. I wish I could pull that off
Fuck yeah! It's kinda weird celebrating father's day with boobies but it feels good.
Thank you.  Same to you!!🦄
Honestly, I keep coming back to this. I think I may now have a goal.
Thank you. I needed this today.
Omg I love that shirt

I got a card from my daughter today that said ""MomDad"" on the front <333

Happy MomDad Day to You <3
how much your glasses cost or were did you get them
it’s just a photo of a washroom door, what’s up with that?
This is my first Father’s Day since coming out so we went with my eldest daughter’s suggestion of ‘Other Mother’s Day’.  Still trying g to figure out what to call myself, might give ‘girldad’ at try!
Same to you sister from one happy Dad to another!🤗
I love that! Happy Father’s Day!#GirlDad
I was thinking about this. I definitely still feel like my sons father figure and thinking of myself as his mother doesn't sit right with me.  Love this shirt 😊
I can’t see who’s in the image. Am I missing something?
I don't remember specifically which site since I use a few different, but they were from either Zenni, Zeelool, or Wherelight. Plus they were only $6 with prescription lenses!
It took me a sec
I first saw the term on Instagram and I loved it! Pretty sure the shirt is supposed to mean ""dad of a girl"" but I like this version better! #girldad"	o4a8hh	trans	946	0.99	2021-06-20 17:11:21

Do I deserve it tho? I can only be a girl at night... during the day, I have to be in boymode....
why is this nsfw???
I did not expect that some kind stranger on the internet whishing me a happy womens day would make me so happy, but here we are. Thank you ! :) \*happy mtf egg noises\*
Thanks!
Now i kinda wish someone will get me a flower one day lol
Thank you!!!!!! How sweet!!!
awww thanks so muchhhh how sweettt <333 ( I dont feel deserving of it tho sad face)
Thank you! I don’t feel deserving of it tho😔
That’s amazing and so sweet.
Up
thank you but let me pass this to someone who deserves it though
Everyone gets flowers :D
when did gift-giving on women's day become a thing?  i'm not against it i just never heard about it til this year
Denmark just ignored us trans women :((
THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!
My best guess is they didn't know spoiler tags did the same thing, and wanted to use that since it's gendered, just in case it might cause dysphoria for transmascs around here?
You're always a girl, just sometimes you have to pretend not to be.
Even if you have to boymode you’re still a girl, so have a flower from me too! 🌸

🌺 here ❤️
You absolutely deserve it! Have one from me too 🌸
You are deserving of it! Have one from me too 🌸
You deserve it! 🌸 have one from me too!

Awww, thx! This means a lot to me!🥰🌸
:D
They might be in the closet (or not at all) and someone says ""oh happy women's day"" even though they aren't a woman. That's my best guess for why they might have dysphoria
Np :>
:,)
Yeah sure I can understand that, but this would not happen on this sub.

I mean, I left this sub for a while due to dysphoria from all the posts here that address the sub's community as ""Ladies"" (though I've seen a lot less of this recently). It could certainly happen on this sub."	ta1399	trans	930	0.99	2022-03-09 05:58:00

Good gawd 🤤🤤
YOU PASS 💖
thank u ❤️
It's the Banana I bet. The Banana is a hidden camera
I’ll never reveal my secrets
I would say that someone else took the picture because you can see that the pic is at an angle of the mirror so you might be able to hide the camera to the opposite angle of the subject of the picture to do that
My guess would be a tilt-shift lens but I'm not that much into professional photography, so there's that.
