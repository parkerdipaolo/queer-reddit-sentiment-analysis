Yes! Although it's rotated there for some reason
I'm planning on ordering a full set of white keycaps for another keyboard and doing the F row in rainbow! Or maybe trying to do the progress flag across the whole board, I'm not sure yet
Take a look at my profile! I had my Logitech board with a similar color scheme üòÖ
I might, I need to figure out if the keychron k3 can have custom rgb but if so I‚Äôll definitely do it
Same here! And an ace flag mousemat underneath

My parents are policing my clothes!	My parents keep making me wear clothes that are really feminine and tighter around the chest, everywhere I go because ‚Äúit looks nicer and less sloppy‚Äù and won‚Äôt let me wear shirts that doesn‚Äôt show the outline of my chest that are just as nice as the others but are not feminine as crap and have told me that ‚Äúbecause your not a boy your not allowed under any circumstance to wear boy clothes‚Äù even more my mother was like ‚Äúyou used to wear dresses and be pretty. I miss that‚Äù I‚Äôm so mad.	"You could try makeing them wildly uncomfortable by telling them to stop sexualizeing you by forceing you to wear reveling clothing
Your parents need to chill out and eat some rocks
Aw, i‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in that situation, parents who police what their children wear are the worst. Are you out to them? if so you could try to reasonable follow up to that, of you aren‚Äôt allowed to wear fem clothes since you‚Äôre not fem (rip nb people I guess they only get big hoodies and sweatpants)
Would showing them baggy t shirts that happen to be from the women‚Äôs department help? Also sorry about the shit parents :(
I'm sorry you have to go through this. Hopefully you're close to 18 so they won't have a say in your clothes any more. If it's reached that boiling point though, wait until your in a public place with a lot of people and yell at them about how creepy it is that they are sexualizing their own child; and that you aren't some doll to dress up, you're a person, one that they should care about.
That, my dear friend, should be child abuse. Children are not your property. the parent is a caretaker not an owner.
My bio parents used to do that tooüò¢

Don‚Äôt worry. You got this. You‚Äôll get through it.
Honestly how does your clothing choice hurt them in any tangible way? 

I‚Äôm sorry you are dealing with this, they are being ridiculous/absurd. I hope you are able to move out of that situation and be yourself when you are able. They cannot control you forever.

Best of luck!

Edit: spelling
My mom said the same thing except it was for spirit week she said ""you can't wear that and pretend You're a boy"" then proceeds to say ""I can easily kick you out but I'm not becouse you my daughter"" like wtf
Ask them why they're grooming you :)
r/insaneparents would be the perfect subreddit also for this. I'd tell them that the clothes you are forcing me to wear isn't me and is super uncomfortable. I'm a tomboy / street clothes, I like the look and feel to be able to express myself. I love you, but this needs to stop. I am my own person. Somewhere among those lines until you are 18. Kids / teens need to express themselves. As a parent myself, I only limit so much but that is out of common sense.
Just tell them theyre groomers who are obsessed with sexualising your body for perverts to stare at and its not okay.

If they keep pushing it, just send your fem stuff to a thrift shop and see if you can trade them for dudes clothes. 

Honestly your parents need to get this image of who they want you to be out of there heads, its a fantasy, it doesnt exist, it isnt you. You need to make a show of how discontent you are. Just dont push it so far that you are at risk of having nowhere to stay.
I have clothes big enough come over and we can have fun together going out in public
Tell your parents to touch some grass and read a book. This is your life, not theirs.
My idea is going to suck, but... Wear the sexiest, most revealing clothes. Hear me out. Wear them, and when people tell you you look hot, tell them your age. If you're younger, people are going to question it. When they do, tell them you don't want to wear it, but your parents make you. It's gonna suck while you're doing it, but if it works, you won't have to wear them anymore. Not the best idea, but when some creepy old man starts hitting on you, hope fully your parents are going to see how stupid they are.
[removed]
Every single cis girl I know wears *some* kind of ""guy's"" clothes, it's completely normal. Usually parents police clothes to make sure they're NOT too revealing. Maybe tell them you want the baggier shapeless clothes because you don't like how people look at you with the other ones?
Yeah I‚Äôm going to add to the echo chamber and say they sound like groomers. There is no logical reason they would want you to reveal your body. I‚Äôm sure they have plenty of whacky-doodle arguments but there are zero reasons. 

‚ÄúYou used to wear dresses and be pretty‚Äù ok so your birthgiver needs to have another child or invest in a really nice doll to play with (which isn‚Äôt helping her case sound stable). I am fairly certain she has plenty of clothes that she used to wear that anyone can pull out of thin air and say I missed when you looked pretty and less old.

OR we can be kind and respectful and adore the uniqueness that is our child and not sexualize them but that would just be too simple and‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ compassionate. :)
Unfortunately this is a tale as old as time. I was 12-14 years old in the early 2000s, and my parents constantly policed my outfits. My mother equally wanted me to ‚Äúnot dress like a boy‚Äù but was concerned about Modesty- you can‚Äôt have it both ways. I‚Äôm sorry they‚Äôre putting you through this.
My mom completely lost her shit when I was leaving for college and bought a pair of cargo shorts with my money but I did it anyway 

I was allowed to wear t-shirts and jeans but they had to be from the women's section 

I was eventually able to move out and buy what I wanted to wear and it was extremely liberating
Throw your moms pants in the trash. Pants aren't appropriate for women lol.
Man your parents suck.
I would have tore the clothes right in front of them if I were you.
That's stupid. They're denying the fact that you might be trans and that's gross of them.
This is not normal. I am so sorry u have to deal with it, it's even worse considering you're transgender.
Ugh. That's such bullshit. You're not a possession or an extension of their will. I hate that they're not treating you like your own person. You should be able to wear what you want and express yourself however you want.

As a parent, hearing things like this makes my blood boil on your behalf. You deserve better. :(

Edit: changed a noun to a verb
This is so real, because my parents are supposedly ‚Äúallies‚Äù but then I go shopping with my mom and all she says is ‚Äúyou need nicer clothes, you look homeless, just come to the womens isle because it will all fit you so much better I promise it will still be androgynous‚Äù and then it‚Äôs like a ruffly floral tight ass top.
I‚Äôm going to guess that you‚Äôre under 18, and/or can‚Äôt move out? In that case, maybe try to pretend you‚Äôre an actor or a spy? Or a drag Queen. It‚Äôs not ideal, but tbh I don‚Äôt know that you have a lot of choices, unfortunately; your parents don‚Äôt seem like the reasonable type :/

I have faith in you though. Some day soon, you‚Äôll be looking back on these days from the outside, having made it through. You got this!
Say you want to wear boy clothes to be modest
A nice reminder is that you dont exist for their amusement. It‚Äôs not about them. You aren‚Äôt a doll. Hell, go buy her a barbie and have her dress that up.
Wow! What they are doing is so really majorly disgusting.
I don't see how this type of parent thinks you're going to keep coming over after you've turned 18. Right now the law says they can do (almost) whatever they want basically, but when you're an adult, it's not like you'd have forgotten all they've done, and still they're really surprised when their kid doesn't visit them
Hmm, if you want to be sneaky and have a good friend who wears the kind of stuff you would prefer, you could ask if they have any fitting clothes to spare. Along with that, if you have a bag or something to hide it in, and then change whenever you get where you want to. Not sure how much they helicopter you, but having a second outfit you prefer that you can switch in and out of could be nice,  just know people talk and she would eventually figure out. 

But it's your life, not hers, and you likely know how she would react already. As long as it's more of her being ""disappointed"" then angry, I honestly think it's something she could grow past. And if faced with it, she will have to contend with if she loves the child she has, or the one envisioned in her head (and likely some bullshit about children if she's trying to make you attract boys).
Your parents apparently don‚Äôt understand that clothing can be unisex.
T-shirts, sweatpants, sneakers, all unisex. I‚Äôd say to try to find a binder you can hide at a friends or school. Then no one will be seeing your chest no matter how many blouses they make you wear. Heck, add a packer for an extra screw you.
My mom was the same way. It was so irritating and saddening. My heart goes out to you.
This is a form of abuse called coercive abuse. So go to the police if it‚Äôs a big problem
That‚Äôs what my parents did when I was in middle school, too.
At some point I just stop putting on feminine clothes regardless what they say. Parents were mad at first but they couldn‚Äòt forcefully do anything with me and the clothings. If they buy some feminine clothings which I didn‚Äôt approve from the beginning, I will never put them on so they will find out it‚Äôs a waste of money. Gradually parents start to respect what I want to wear, then
Tbh you could burn all your clothes to prove a point. I know it is expensive and probably more money to spend on newer clothes that you like. But they can‚Äôt force you to wear feminine clothes if you don‚Äôt have any left
i‚Äôm a firm believer in ‚Äúif you want to stop people from asking u to do something, just do it really bad.‚Äù like when i was younger - i would either do it in hiding (change in the bathrooms at school/friends etc) or i would take it to such a place they have no choice. like. im a trans woman but if lil me were in ur shoes i might go with ‚Äúoh u want revealing and form fitting lmao‚Ä¶.‚Äù and then roll up in an xtina eary 2000s get up
A lot of cis girls wear their boyfriends clothes. Get a fake boyfriend (or real one, post doesn't indicate sexuality) and say you're wearing his clothes
That‚Äôs fucking repulsive. I know it‚Äôs hard but you need to say something. This is more than gender they are forcefully sexualizing you without your consent. Fucking tell everyone you know that your parents make you wear revealing outfits when you don‚Äôt want to. Holy shit. What the fuck
if you‚Äôd be comfortable with it, wear the most ridiculously revealing feminine outfit possible and if they say something just say it‚Äôs because they told you to
Pull any flannel or oversize shirts out of her closet and tell her she can't wear them either, or better yet swapher whole wardrobe with oversized baggy stuffs
Parents think they can control their kids, like somehow your not an individual. They‚Äôll never get what they want really, and in due time you‚Äôll get exactly what you want. They‚Äôll just have to hold on desperately for now while the sand slips right through they‚Äôre grubby fingers
I hate when parents try to control thier kids, my mom tries to control me the same way
Damn that‚Äôs horrible. You should have the freedom to wear what you want. i am sorry that your parents are so restrictive and discriminatory. You are valid and i hope that they change or that you can find an escape.
""You used to not mind other people's business and be nice. I miss that"".
I fought with my mother over this literally from the time I started school. She was OBSESSED with me wearing dresses to school. Even when she found out that was an outdated notion, she wouldn't drop the insistence that I MUST wear a dress of her choosing to school on the first day of the school year. One year the dress she bought me was so outlandish that one of my high school teachers threatened to call my mother! LMFAO   I begged her to do that, to send me home to change clothes. No dice. My advice: leave home as soon as you graduate.
I don't usually condone murder, but...
calmly remind them that wearing what you want makes you happy. and that you dont mind what other people think about it. if that doesnt work its not your fault, they are controlling and destroying your own boundaries. you are your own person and are allowed to do something as innocent as expressing yourself through what you wear and being you.
My mom also doesn‚Äôt let me wear men‚Äôs clothing and it makes me uncomfortable, but she‚Äôs never that strict about what I wear ):
Let me guess... Country of freedom?
UGH SAME HERE. THEY LITERALLY TOOK AWAY NEARLY ALL THE STUFF I BOUGHT WITH *MY* MONEY. I WORK. I'M SO FUCKING ANGRY
my parents r just like this.. clothes shopping is an actual nightmare I get sick going into stores
Omg my mom is the same way ""wear makeup for your stepdad"" or ""wear a dress instead of a flannel with a bowtie"" ""here take this thong"" like jeez I'm only a kid (I just.mean under 18)
Just go to the opposite extreme. Wear exceedingly tight, revealing clothes that exaggerate feminine sexuality, and ensure you flaunt it in front of them. 

If they refuse to acknowledge your gender identity choices, then make them uncomfortable with theirs.
It's very strange that they want you to wear tight clothes. This, as well as their comments to you, make me think that they suspect you might be transgender, and that that's why they're doing this
So, I got a fight w mom for this kind of topic, like she bought a sandal I did not want, it‚Äôs too girly, I didnt wear it, she‚Äôs mad, and criticized me and told me mot to call her mom until I figured out about my action. My colleague heard my story and tell me, wait for a moment, whole family is having fun, and make a confession, telling them this is you, they can forcefully change you now, but when they‚Äôre gone, or you leave the house, you‚Äôll be just like you are. Say that, family supposed to be rely on, for you to be confident about yourself, not taking criticism so much that makes you have a bad thought and do not wanted to face them or even dont wanna come home, you love them, and you want a happy family, but you also wanted to be you yourself, if family keeps on forcing you like that, happy is no longer a term for you to define about family.
Explain them gently, dont cause more hatred, it‚Äôll makes things worse. And if they still not understand, it‚Äôs time to leave home (only if you‚Äôre enough old due to your country‚Äôs law to be independent, otherwise, find some allies to defend you).
Wtf?! That‚Äôs super messed up.
God I hate people like that I'm so sorry about that and I hope you can convince them overwise but I don't think you can with the information I have here
Fuck that, if your parents want you to wear clothes like that they can dress you by hand or let you wear what you want. I‚Äôm so sorry they‚Äôre treating you that way.
I‚Äôm so sorry, your situation sounds really bad.
Think about family members that could support you, or legal help in your state.
Their obsession to FORCE you and not allow you to wear whatever you want is violent asf.

Even emancipation could be a last good stance. Obviously only you know your situation
can we guess whos going to the retirement home?
Relatable. I feel you OP. I feel you.
They‚Äôre not only being transphobic but they‚Äôre hyper sexualizing you so they can look at you like how society sees women as sex icons because (no offense) they think in their little pea brains that that‚Äôs how women should be. (Which isn‚Äôt true at all)
I‚Äôm going to guess that you‚Äôre a minor so you should talk to a consular about this but keep in mind that some(most/all) school councilors tell parents what their kids say.
Now after all that said, there‚Äôs still ways to make yourself look masculine and have a flatter chest.
1. Trans tape(online)/ KT tape (pharmacy)
2. Binders (online or target)
3. Contour your face to look more masculine and you can even add a shadow over your lips with eye shadow a bit darker than your skin tone. You can get mascara that is close to your hair color and use it in your eyebrows very lightly to make them bushier

I don‚Äôt know how else to help but I wish you the best
I'm sorry you're dealing with this OP, it sounds awful. It sounds like you parents are being controlling just for the sake of it. Tell them that forcing you into dressing a certain way makes you uncomfortable and if they won't listen donate all those feminine clothes or trade them for something you like. Your parents will be mad, but it's your body, not theirs, and if they don't understand that then what they're doing is not out of love or concern for you; it's selfish and borders on abuse. Talk to a school counselor or reach out to a local support group about it if you can, bc this is not okay.
Fucking cut them up. Slash them to goddamned ribbons. Burn the fuck out of them (safely).
My mum says the same thing selfish and a narcacist god she's so retarded don't put up with their shit as soon as possible change your last name and find a new family they don't deserve you
[removed]
They have no right to do that. It's abuse and you don't have to endure it. Ask them why they prefer cloth that make you mis√©rable ? Do they enjoy seing you unhappy ? Do they try to push you to commit suicide ? What's the goal ?

Maybe if you tell them that way, calm and sincere, they could understand. But even if they don't, it's abuse and you don't have to take it
fuck them bro, if you feel you are boy, that YOU are boy, even if they say you are girl, that's not true. my parents do the same thing and i know what you feel. this is not what good parents do.
Go full slut. Ice on your nips so they definitely show up under really tight tops. Micro mini skirts that show your butt all the time- wear a swimsuit bottom under it, though. Midriff baring crop tops. Garish makeup.

Swish your hips exaggeratedly when you walk. Every so often, arch your back backwards so your boobs really stick out. Highly sexual and borderline inappropriate.

Do it enough, and they might ""force"" you to wear less revealing clothing. (Not like thats what you're ""trying"" to get them to do... XD)

Theres a debating tactic called ""reductio ad absurdum, where you take their arguments to the extreme logical conclusion to show them the absurdity of their thinking.
The exchange of information is how any systems are able to cohere. In this case, I'd try asking your mom if she likes the clothes she wears and if wearing them makes her feel good and happy. If it does, then ask her to imagine what it would feel like being forced to wear clothes that didnt make her feel as good. See what she says. Idk what your parent situation is like, but if she says something along the lines of dressing to make her significant other happy, then you should remind her to take care of herself and find something SHE really likes. 

I'm the kind of person that doesnt really get mad at others, more the systems that make them. I ALSO believe that if you could PERFECTLY comprehend the subjective experience of even someone that murders someone else, it would be hard to get MAD at them, as they were probably completely internally compelled to do what to them felt like the right thing.
Thats dumb they should let you choose how you want to dress but i guess in todays world that's just how it is
""You used to be nice, and loved me for me.""
One option is to tell them that those clothes make you uncomfortable because the way strangers look at you in them is inappropriate.
""hey Cunt, did you prefer it when I used to call you 'mom'? Yeah, we all like to be treated in a way that makes us feel respected, Cunt. I totally understand how upsetting it is when people force their desires on you.""

(people have told me i may not give the kindest advice)
As a little kid decades ago I wanted to wear a rainbow shirt because I liked all the colors and adults wouldn't let me people... you know... I might be associated with something. Ugh.

Sorry you're going through this. Upside, you'll have more freedom when you get older.
You should bring a measuring tape and just start measuring them and saying how that‚Äôs not fashionable anymore. That they have to wear clothing that makes them less comfortable or else they will be seen as pariahs with their colleagues and friends and if they don‚Äôt like that make the recommendations even worse until they get frustrated and realize that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing to you
If it were me, I'd dress in the most atrocious femme af drag clothes as possible until the stfu but im both a dick and an established adult so ymmv
Yeah, same thing here. My parents got mad because I bought a man's swimsuit and a swimsuit that doesn't show my thights. They got mad because I didn't wanna show MY THIGHTS and go to the pool like I was wearing just underwear. Also I've noticed that the shirts that ""fit me"" are the one that make obvious I have boobs. I fuuuucking hate it. My aunt said ""you should try to wear something with a little bit of cleavage someday. Not too much, but a little"". Oh and the ""u used to wear dresses, I miss that"" It's also really relatable. And they always use the ""you have a nice body"" thing. ""You shouldn't be ashamed"". It's not the same fucking thing I'm not ashamed because I think I'm fat I'm ashamed because I'M NOT A GIRL. I'm an enby and a minor, damn it.

You're not alone. Good luck with that pal, hope it gets better soon
This was my thought, too. Never met parents who openly support their children showing off their bodies.
And if OP manages to say it within earshot of strangers, OP's mom would actually consider what an outside observer might think about her controlling behavior.

Either she vastly improves, or she gets angry and double-down on covering up the threat to her family's public image. OP would know how their  mom is likely to react.

""I'm not a lifeless plastic doll for you to dress-up and sexualize, Mom. I respect me and my body even if you don't.""
Yeah I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm brave enough for that lol.
True tell them it‚Äôs creepy and weird for them to do that. Wtf.
Or wear nothing but fuckin bondage for a day but that‚Äôs a bit too risky so don‚Äôt actually do that
Yes and lol to the second part
I love this comment
They gotta touch some grass for sure as well
FR tho rocks be tasty af
It‚Äôs not your fault. I am out to them but they still see me as a girl :/. (Lol to the NB part)
They are from the womens department‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs nyf
Its nyf. I‚Äôm moving out before 18 but I‚Äôll still be reliant on them. I wouldn‚Äôt tell them that but yeah I‚Äôll manage :/ thanks for the concern tho and yeah
Yeah I know but I don‚Äôt think it is. They mean well.
Thank you and I know it‚Äôs just hard sometimes
Apparently I look sloppy and messy with looser shirts and it‚Äôs not presentable. (I don‚Äôt) and thanks for the luck
I‚Äôm pretty sarcastic, I‚Äôd respond with something like pressed collared polo with trousers. Business casual, prim and proper in my book. 

JK, I hope it goes well for you! You will be ok. üòä
I‚Äôm so sorry
Kicking you out is illegal if you‚Äôre under 18
Ha I wouldn‚Äôt but yeah I get the seniment
r/insaneparents
Yeah I get it. I‚Äôll check out the sub later maybe
Would give you a medal but im poor lol
*psssst:*

**discontent*
I wouldn‚Äôt tell Tim that. I can‚Äôt rn but I will when I‚Äôm older. Yes definitely to the last part.  Children aren‚Äôt coloring books. You can‚Äôt color them in with your favorite colors quote comes to mind
üòÇ
Lol yeah I know
I‚Äôve actually heard this. I‚Äôm in high school and that would just make my parents fight harder for me to be a girl
Nyf :/
That‚Äôs a good idea I didn‚Äôt think of that
Their argument is if we do that then we can keep our little girl but yes I totally agree
Yeah I know. It‚Äôs nyf it‚Äôs just frustrating
Yeah I can‚Äôt wait to move out and have some freedom but I may have to still justify my purchases to my parents. I don‚Äôt know yet
üòÇ
I wouldn‚Äôt but I get the seNtiment
You're absolutely right. But also... even if they weren't trans, where's their personal autonomy? Not even allowed to wear 'boyish' girls clothes? Dafuq?
Yeah I know :/. They want their‚Äù little girl‚Äù
Yeah and it‚Äôs nyf
Exactly and thanks for the support. I won‚Äôt do that to my kids for sure if I have them
They are Allies for gay but idk how they feel about trans. I‚Äôm sorry about that
Yes I am and even when I move out I‚Äôm still under their reign as I depend on them financially. I get that yeah and it would be better if I didn‚Äôt get clocked 24/7 in any clothes that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù. And yeah. Thanks for the faith!
Yeah that didn‚Äôt work :/
Lol and yeah I know
Phh it‚Äôs frustrating
Yeah but I‚Äôm still gonna be financially dependent but yeah visits will be limited esp after medical transition
I did that but I still can‚Äôt wear it most of the time which sucks.  They helicopter a lot‚Ä¶I agree with you but she just tries to ignore it most of the time. :/
Clothing in unisex. Idk how I can get one but I‚Äôm trying. And yeah I change at school sometimes. I makeshift bind and pack
I‚Äôm not going to but thanks for the sentiment
I can‚Äôt. They only buy really feminine clothes except for once I got away with androgynous ones
They would make me buy more :/
Lol and I do the change thing now
Yeah I did that when I was cis and my mom flipped on me
I am not comfortable sadly but yeah I get the sentiment
She doesn‚Äôt have any. She wears mostly dresses and ‚Äúfancy‚Äù pants
Exactly. It reminds me of the quote children aren‚Äôt coloring books you can‚Äôt fill them in with your favorite colors. I totally agree
:/
It‚Äôs nyf and thank you
Say that or are you stating it?
Yep and lol. Even if I leave then which I will I‚Äôm still financially dependent on them
So they have chosen death
Lol no but lol at the same time
Didn‚Äôt work and yeah exactly
:/
Yeah
Yeah exactly
I‚Äôve heard this but I can‚Äôt do that. I wish I was that gutsy tho.
They know actually
I‚Äôm not old enough and I will. I definitely don‚Äôt define my happiness on them, but I do love them. I just wish they accepted me as me or at least let me be
:/
It‚Äôs nyf and no I don‚Äôt know if I will ever convince them that I am truly a guy but I still have hope I will
 It‚Äôs nyf and sometimes they do dress me :/
I don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs been an idea but I‚Äôll be an adult soon anyways
Okay. It‚Äôs nyf and if I did that they‚Äôd just buy more girly clothes :/
Most sane Redditor (respectfully)
No‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm not and the fact you think that is sad
My mom forced me to wear bikinis as a kid (ftm) because I had a beautiful body and should be proud of it‚Ä¶ fucking weirdos
Unfortunately they're not thinking of it that way.  They're trying to condition them into accepting their body.
Same, I was feeling uncomfortable reading this post thinking about OP's parents as possible sex offenders.
My parents do...my mother literally forces me to wear really short pants to show off my ""beautiful"" legs
It's even weirder than that, they don't just support it, they require it.

And if the OP is a minor, then it's not just weird, it's downright creepy.
My cousin was forced to dance, wear super tight clothes, etc... All because my aunt had, and still has, major body image issues. It was super gross because she'd be all ""oooo boys are gonna love how that makes you look"" and whatnot.

No surprise, said cousin now has body image issues. She equates her worth to how much a guy wants to sleep with her...
Love the phrasing but i Won‚Äôt say it to her
If you can stomach it,  you could try going full revealing,  I'm not sure how revealing they have  you dressing now,  but maybe if you go to the extreme it will show them how cazy they are being.  Unfortunately that might be hard on you.  Another option might be getting rid of the clothes you don't like? Or donate them/ give them to a friend? Both of those things aren't going end up being fun or even easy, but I thought I'd suggest them.  Sending lots of love!
So it‚Äôs deliberate abuse then.
If you are out to them, can you tell them that dressing that way makes you feel worse? They may think they are helping you love the body you have, but maybe they would be understanding if you told them those clothes are actually amplifying all your dysphoria.
a h, oh dear

(also can I ask what nyf means? Never heard that before)
They clearly don't. You've said you're out to them and they still see you as a girl. Nothing about that is ""meaning well"".
You always have us (the trans side of Reddit). And whatever theater kids are at your school, most likelyüòÇ
Hey OP i know how you feel. I'm in my 20s and my parents were always controlling of what I wore but it got worse when I came out to them (ftm) and it's one of the reasons I yeeted. If possible, try to get a job so you dont have to be dependent on them when you move out.
Sloppy is a subjective opinion. Simply put she is wrong.
Yea that is the problem I am 18 :(
It's there and corrected. I hate autocorrect and appreciate the help!
Well... I did say it wasn't a good idea...
Well I feel deep down you‚Äôll make it out fine but I hope your parents turn around. If they don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs their loss. I know it‚Äôs cliche to say but it truly is. 

I know since transitioning I have been not only the best version of myself but the true version of myself. 

While in your parents care, I ask that you just take time to prioritize your self-care and mental health in any way that translates for you, personally. That‚Äôs easier said than done but I can say that being 31 and almost a year in (super delayed) transition that sometimes we have more in us than we can even imagine. 

Focus on what brings you joy; art, music, nature, pets, friends‚Ä¶ you know what they are for you. I feel these days more than ever it can be hard to do so be kind and understanding to yourself.

Also I‚Äôd like to say I genuinely appreciate you and everything that you are. I am also FTM so I‚Äôm coming from a pretty personal place saying this

Keep doing you, bub. You got this.
When you get old enough, try and get money of your own in an account they can't watch.
Yeah
They are old fashioned?
aaaaa pleaseee
Yeah. You'll break the cycle of ignorance.
No problem! I‚Äôm sure someone else has
said this, but try to get financially independent asap. Maybe try freelance writing, or something similarly easy to hide (I assume). Good luck!
Ah, that sucks.
No bandages right?
You can ask around at a mall or clothing stores for unisex clothes, and if you can't find them there are plenty of ""Boyfriend-sized"" clothes in the women's stores (I think they're literally just men's clothes with ""Boyfriend"" tags on them.)
Maybe try stick to the least feminine ones?
Not out of your pocket right?
Oh yikes, I'm sorry
It's what you gotta answer to her.
You need to fix that. It's crazy and self-destructive for a GUY to be financially dependent on people who force HIM to wear dresses!
You can always cut your hair. They can't control that. Even if they refuse to take you to a barber, you always have scissors.
Fair enough. I got angry on your behalf.

An older female relative once pointedly gave me a bikini for my birthday in front of my friends, accompanied with a quip about accepting my femininity. I was like 11-12 and ""taking too long in the tomboy phase.""

I actually did whip around and call her a pervert right then and there. There was hell to pay, but it was worth it.
Idk if this is similar or not, but my mom gets mad when I don't wanna get changed in front of her and my grandma, because ""we all have the same parts"" and I'm ""not ugly"" so I shouldn't be insecure. 1) It's called gender dysphoria... and 2) I don't even have to be insecure to just not want to be naked in front of people.
I wanted to instinctively downvote this,  because jebus fuck that's repulsive
Dude my mom bought me A BIKINI TONGUE AND TOLD ME TO WEAR IT ""cause i have a nice body""
At that time I was like 16
Never used it but i hated so mucb how my mom used to sexualize me on my teen years
Parents can be so weird about this stuff. I know you're describing a real phenomenon, but I experienced the opposite with very Christian parents who wanted me to hate my body as sinful (regardless of gender) because of sky daddy. That made me think everyone was uncomfortable in their bodies, so I ""accepted"" mine for way too long.
I condition my kiddos into accepting their bodies by ***letting them wear whatever the fuck they want to*** as long as they're sufficiently covered and (hopefully) prepared for the weather

Once in a while they'll ask how something looks/ if it's ok. I'll point out if there's anything really glaringly 'wrong' but otherwise turn their question back on them:  How do *they* like what they've chosen? Do *they* feel good,  confident,  attractive in the clothes they're wearing? Will they be comfortable in it?

It's murkier waters now that they're teens... working out how they want to present themselves,  and what exactly qualifies as 'sufficiently covered' for the situations they'll be in

... but it has never once crossed my mind to try to force them to wear/ not wear something
They are just old fashioned
I feel so bad for your cousin, I'm sorry to hear that...
Totally valid, stay safe!
I could not lol but they‚Äôd also use that to prove their point. I have tried that but then I‚Äôm forced to buy more of that stuff or she gets mad I‚Äôm getting rid of all my ‚Äúcute clothes‚Äù. Thanks for the love
Idk. They are old fashioned I think it‚Äôs just that
Maybe. I don‚Äôt know how to describe dyphoria but I could try talking to them maybe
Not your fault (not OP, just realised when reading it)
not your fault
Not your fault
I dunno. I know they love me it‚Äôs just. They don‚Äôt get that I‚Äôm not a girl I guess?
Haha yeah thanks
Yeah exactly. I‚Äôm gonna try to
Yeah ik. Her sloppy means not prim and proper
üòÇ
Exactly and yeah I will. I will try thank you. and thank you so much that means a lot
I guess. It just seems super old fashioned to me, and I'm 38
I will try. Thank you
Nah
Yeah I know but I‚Äôm not allows to buy them
Yeah I try
No
Ah okay. I prob wouldn‚Äôt tho
Fair point. I‚Äôm not allows to get a job but I think I want to try to get one in secret when I move away
Haha I did cut my hair :)
Haha yeah :/
[deleted]
This sounds like a fun story, how did she react?
Yes and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what mothers and daughters do‚Äù
It‚Äôs totally similar, it‚Äôs just freaking weird. Do what makes you feel comfortable. anyone telling you to do different might be trying to help, sure - but it almost certainly has an undertone of their inability to stop sexualising bodies.
I am not trans but never liked changing in front of others and I am a professional cyclist with a lovely body. There is a reason why we have private dressing rooms.
I was nine at best üò≥üòù
A lot of parents just see their kids as vessels for their own vicarious living through a second youth, unfortunately. So if mom wishes she could be young and sexy again (or for the first time if she never got a chance) she might try to force her kid to live that fantasy regardless of how uncomfortable it's making everyone else involved.
To hell with religion that crap puts people in shit situations for no reason
‚ÄúSly Daddy‚Äù üòÇüòÇ im using that from now on. Yea I feel you though on the christian parents.
Well that's because you aren't a shitty person.
Good, I am feeling reassured now. I hope you find in yourself the strength to resist until you will be free to take your own decisions.
Sounds like the same thing to me. Old fashioned: Sex Offender. Tomato tomato lol
Thank you
Not that I‚Äôm saying that this is abuse, but being ‚Äúold fashioned‚Äù does not affect whether something is abuse in any way. Beating a child with 12lb club because you‚Äôre ‚Äúold fashioned‚Äù is still beating them with a 12lb club.

As the spawn of a Southern Baptist Preacher, I can assure you being ‚ÄúOld Fashioned‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make you abusive. But it sure as hell doesn‚Äôt excuse a shive behavior either. If you parents are behaving poorly or mistreating you (abusive or otherwise) they don‚Äôt need you to peddle excuses for them.
Ugh. Lamest excuse in the book. My (MtF) parents used to do this shit to me; ""you looked so much more handsome (ü§Æ) with shorter hair,"" ""you should really dress up more, you look so nice in slacks/button-ups,"" etc. Not that any of these things can't look perfectly good on girls - or anyone of any identity, for that matter - they just personally didn't appeal to be even before I realised I was experiencing dysphoria. 

Whether your parents are ""old fashioned"" or not, they just want you to look the way *they* want, because you're not your own person; you're an object for their status in society. Especially if you're already out to them. This is grade-A ""I want my daughter back"" desperation. Do everything you can to fight that shit. And if all else fails, at least take solace in knowing that you'll be able to wear whatever you want as soon as you're out of their house. Hopefully sooner. They should have no power over you in that regard.
ahh, thx
thanks
thx!
If they don't love you enough to respect you, do they really love you?
Yeah lol I get it
Good. I wish you luck.
Even when they're sold in women's stores?? Dang, she's so triggered by masc clothes. /:

Maybe you can get a cis woman (friend, relative, authority figure, etc) with a roughly similar fashion taste to defend you, that you don't have to dress hyper-feminine and you should at least be allowed to have your own style detached from your gender expression (for now).

To force someone to even go against their aesthetic preferences alone can have lasting psychological damage.
Good luck!
Good on you. Don't allow them to dictate who you are.
I'm sorry your parents are being such dickheads. I think a lot of people on here are telling you but just as one more voice to add to it: *they're wrong. This is not cool of them and they are very wrong.*   


Whatever clothes you want to wear are correct and there's nothing inherently wrong or right about garments <3
What did they say
She ran off and cried lol. 

My mom was pissed though. Long lecture about being ungrateful and abusive. - ""She's just trying to help you accept yourself!""
There are no words to describe how uncomfortable I would feel getting undressed with *anyone* in the room at that age, let alone *my mom.*
im all for body positivity, but that also means looking good for ourselves, what was she thinking? most parents would be happy their kid WASN'T wearing bikinis in elementary school!
Thank you
Yeah I guess and idk I don‚Äôt know if they are doing what they do on purpose  well I mean knowing it hurts
Me.
I mean. Yes. They do
Thank you
Yeah I know. She likes me to wear traditional women clothes as ‚ÄúI am her little girl‚Äù and as a result anything masculine is a no. I‚Äôve been able to get androgynous clothes one time but I‚Äôm not allowed to wear them to school 9/10 times. I got secret boy clothes but they aren‚Äôt at my house
Thank you exactly and yeah
I wanna know too.
Nothing worth repeating, just some one being a total jerk.
Yeah same. Trans or cis. Even when I was cis I hated people seeing my body, esp since I have certain things on my body
Yeah exactly, the kid should be choosing what‚Äôs comfortable and appealing to them - not encouraged to wear something because of an adult‚Äôs visual preference, which is almost certainly inherently sexual/sexualising the child ü§¢
Theyre adults, they can have some damn agency for their actions

They can absolutely be working harder to fight their biases and understand you, but they arent

Theyre failing you as parents, and they deserve to be blamed for that. You cant excuse them and say ""they dont know any better"" because you are *giving them the opportunity to know better, and theyre refusing it.*

Thats their concious decision to be shitty to you. Dont excuse it. It hurts, it sucks, but you need to accept that theyre to blame.
Consider why you're afraid to tell them any of the things you've responded to with ""I wouldn't tell them that but..."" Why are you afraid? I'm betting the answer is you know their love is conditional, which is then simply not love.
I still wear long sleeves even in summer (granted I try to keep the material thin and the sleeves rolled up mostly.)

I had some family members who openly mocked me and wanted to know why I was being so dumb as to wear sleeves in 90 degrees.

I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúbecause I feel really fucking uncomfortable in public and covering myself up makes me feel better and more secure‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt say anything, because I knew how it would work out.
I guess your right. It‚Äôs just hard to accept that for me. Idk.
I am having trouble coming up with a response to this‚Ä¶ I mean. I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll hate me or stop loving me if I show proof I disobey them or question them bc they have kept me under such a tight leash I‚Äôm afraid to make them mad at me or that they‚Äôll go thru my stuff or obsessively question me about every little thing. I mean my mom found a pride flag in my room and managed to come up with 20 questions, some of them repeated, in an accusing tone
If anyone asks you this, maybe say it‚Äôs to avoid sunburn. Could get you out of trouble maybe
That makes sense
Best of luck, hon. I really hope they come around and you can have a healthy relationship with them, but my bets are on you realizing they don't care enough to provide that, and I know that's hard, but the sooner you're able to move on and surround yourself with people who will actually support you, the better.
Thank you and yeah me too. That is hard and a good point. I‚Äôll just see what happens until I can move out and make my decision. Thanks"	wurr1q	trans	1965	0.95	2022-08-22 12:02:00

Actually either way you look at it it‚Äôs pretty straight
Uh ya... what‚Äôs confusing?
That's beautiful! So happy for you two.
They're so cute. And it's really amazing because my girlfriend previously identified as lesbian, but when I realised I was trans (completely because of her talking about what it was like to realise she was trans and how great it was to start HRT and I just kinda had the thought 'I wanna be a boy) and she still loves me even though I'm a boy. She's really supportive of me and it just makes me feel so good. #transcouplesarepowercouples

My gf and I realized similar things as wells. I only dated cis women before her and she only dated cis men but we both realized it‚Äôs more than that. I‚Äôm attracted to femininity in general, and she is attracted to masculinity. Doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs in their pants ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Of course! Already been thinking about how I‚Äôm gonna do it.
Lmfao your totally clueless and it‚Äôs quite entertaining. Why does it matter which one I am? And she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlook like a girl‚Äù she IS a girl ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yes very good observation but that does not change our sexuality just because we are in a hetero relationship
My girlfriend and were more or less the same way. She only dated cis women before me, and I was the same way. I wasn't interested in dating trans women because I wasn't fond of what they had in their pants, but then I met her and I fell immediately, and suddenly what was in her pants didn't matter to me. And then I realised I was trans about a month and a half into the relationship, and my girlfriend was really supportive of me and said that she didn't care that I was a boy and I was the only exception.
You've *got* to keep us updated on this! Can't wait to hear how it all turns out. I'm so excited and happy for you guys!
[deleted]
Lmfao I am bisexual, if I‚Äôm with a woman we are in a hetero relationship yes? But does that make me straight? No I‚Äôm still bisexual. There is more than gay or straight ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What does that have to do with anything?

Your comments are not making sense. U seemed supportive then you turned into a dick and now I‚Äôm just confused ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è not wasting my time

band class	"I was in my band class and we had a sub who was taking attendance. My dead name is in the school system so he called that out and then i corrected him and he apologized and THEN some kid goes, ""Wait your name is (dead name)?"". 
And I replied, ""No it's Doe,"". 
""That's not what it says up there though,"" (the online attendance sheet was up on the smart board), ""Your name isn't Doe,"" There was a bit of back or forth between us and he begins to get more angry as the conversation goes on. 
Then one of the kids near him goes ""Their name is Doe,"" 
And a bunch of people say something along the lines of ""Dude it's Doe just chill out,"". 
And then he has the audacity to say, ""Why are YOU getting so mad,"" despite the whole situation being because of him and him being the one who was getting mad. Then everyone told him to shut up. The whole class defending me single handedly made my week.

That‚Äôs amazing.

I‚Äôd love to hear an update on this one.
>he literally got ratioed IRL

lmao
What an annoying prick, I hope he keeps his mouth shut next time. Glad it ended up okay OP
This is so uplifting, thank you for sharing!
Omg your name is awesome ;o;
It was so fucking stupid of that kid to argue, especially because school databases often get names wrong even when it's not trans-related. Some kids in my district put nicknames/preferred names in the system when they were in elementary school and the names are still there in the database, so that's what the subs call out. A kid named Hunter used to go by ""AJ"" for some unknown reason for one year in elementary school and that's still what subs get on their roll sheets and call out. If someone says their name is something in an informal setting like school, people should just believe it.
That's incredible. Though I got the impression that he didn't even consider that you might me trans and was just confused that the names were different lol
I nearly choked on my gum laughing at this fool XD
Thats a solid win! Heck yes!!
i hope he steps on a lego for you <3
Probably the best thing I read all day
thats awesome!
You‚Äôre a doe

My fream is to have friends like this, heck I would dream to have friends.
love that. few years ago my friend called me my preferred name and a sub who knew me pretty well as my deadname was like ‚Äú[deadname]???‚Äù and everyone was like ‚Äúits milo‚Äù and he was like ‚Äúits [deadname]‚Äù and then everyone was like ‚ÄúITS MILO‚Äù
Lol
God attendance was the bane of my existence, I remember countless mad sprints to the teachers desk when I was late and realized there was a sub... bad times
This... Does bring a smile to my face

Doe-pe
Thanks!
bruh literally i changed my name in the Schoology app for a joke in like 8th grade (to see how long until a teacher noticed) and then the school removed the ability to do so (but didn't fix any names), so for the *entire year* my name would show up as just the letter E on like half of the teachers' documents including seating charts. fast forward to freshman year, they fixed it, but a *teacher* (who had students the previous year messing with their names) tried to argue with me that my name was (deadname) because that's what it said on the system, and said she would not call me by my name unless that's what it showed on the seating chart.

some people are just fucking stupid and argumentative for absolutely no reason other than to be an asshole or trying to score cool points with their peers.
During attendance he also told the teacher he went by a different name that wasn‚Äôt in the school system lmao
Fuck off, let Doe be themself. Also looking at your comment history is so sad lmfao. You really are a incel.

What did that fucker say?
Basically being super transphobic/enbyphobic and insulting Doe's name. That person was also being super creepy in a bunch of other comments.

Passing.		"Yup, I have a friend who is the same height as me. She gets misgendered more often than me. She usually just introduces herself with her pronouns or goes I'm a girl.
can confirm! my sister is a trans woman and we bonded a lot early in her transition because I was also in my teens and experiencing a lot of similar issues -- unwanted hair, misgendering, random emotional changes, etc. I am cis, but I look myself in the middle every day and think, ""do I look girly enough to convince other people I am a girl?"" I think most feminine people I've interacted with in my life have experienced some degree of this üòä
Man if I learned one thing from transitioning, it‚Äôs how much of what I _thought_ was dysphoria is actually just insecurities and social pressures that every woman deals with. Like, it‚Äôs not 100%, there‚Äôs still definitely things about being trans that cis women don‚Äôt really relate to, but at the same time it‚Äôs kinda comforting to learn how normal some of these feelings are.
TERFs will be out here screaming at hairy cis women, or fat cis women, or tall cis women while pretending that they're the only thing 'protecting' us. üôÑ
Real. TERFs are cringe.
Not just women but everyone wants to feel like their gender.  Still, this still mindfucks me.  Just feels weird relating to women at such a core level, that really want to appear like women too and every and have similair struggles.
This is true, i look fairly masculine, and hobbies are similar. for years i struggled because i got called lesbian/butch/a man/whatever  
Now old enough that i dont care as much because im happy with who i am, Also realized it says more about THEM that they think those are  insults
Are they actually TERFs or just transphobes?  Because there‚Äôs a big difference between a *trans-exclusionary radfem* and someone that just doesn‚Äôt respect trans people.  There‚Äôs a lot of people throwing around the word TERF lately without understanding the acronym.
TERFs have far more in common with the misogynistic alt-right than they do with feminism.
Almost as if trying to define and enforce strict gender norms or holding people to unreasonably high beauty standards is a bad thing. Almost as if cis women have every right to be who they want to be as much as anyone does. Almost as if having a picture perfect idea of how you think the world ought to be and throwing a fit, or violence, when someone/something doesn't fit said subjective ""utopia"" is a horrible thing to do. 

If a girl wants to wear a dress, great. If she wants to smell like a campfire, build a wood cabin, kill her own dinner, skin it, and wear its pelt she has as much right to that as any ""truly manly man"" does. 

And the same goes for any gender, sexuality, or what have you! Gay men do NOT need to act how you expect them to act. Lesbians are NOT required to meet your expectations. Trans people do NOT need to get the body modifications you think make them ""true trans."" 

It's almost as if life, including human life, is SUPER DIVERSE and shoving people into predetermined boxes is bad.
Yeah before I realized I was a trans man, I was not exactly butch , but I had short hair, was somewhat muscular (I did karate for 6 years ), and had a very slightly deeper voice than most other afab people. I would get stared at, glared at, told that this was the womens changing room, and once got told I didn‚Äôt belong in there. And all of this was in a dojo that was run by a butch and fem lesbian couple, so you‚Äôd think the people going to it regularly would not have such a strict idea of what a woman looks like. Transphobia is ducking stupid. Tho to be fair in the end they were right
Word. Thats why I dont worry about passing. Cis women come in different shapes and sizes, so do trans women.
I knew a couple once. Super femme trans gal and butch cis girl. The trans girl was terrified of using the ladies room, so her gf escorted her in. This total Karen apparently took one look at both of them, scowled, and left to get a security guard. They couldnt finish up fast enough and when the Karen came back she pointed at the butch cis girl and said, ""Remove that *man* from the *women's* restroom."" They both burst out laughing before leaving since they were all but done at that point.
Embrace the ""just being me"" life. Same as all trans and enbies etc are valid so are you as a ""non girly"" woman
Idk, TERFS in practice seem to care a lot more about the trans exclusion than the feminism.
Its definitely some of both.  Many TERFs aren't exactly great to women who don't fit in their picture either.  Quiet a few are against gay marriage, look down on those who are fat, old, etc.  They're just not nice people.
""radical feminism"" as used to refer to terfs and swerfs is inherently misogynistic, sexist and also varying degrees of fascist, so what tumblr OP is getting is absolutely on brand with them. They're alt right transphobes who appropriate feminism to justify their hate"	xwn86p	trans	1463	0.99	2022-10-05 21:40:32
Sad story :(	I work at a grocery store and today something broke my heart.  A mom, her older daughter, and a little boy came into the line. I was bagging for them and making light conversation. It was fine until she rubbed the boys head and said ‚Äúyour such a pretty girl‚Äù The kid then said, ‚ÄúMom I‚Äôm not a girl I‚Äôm a boy.‚Äù The mom then said, ‚Äúand i thought i was a dog when i was a kid.‚Äù Then she looks at me and says she thinks she is in the wrong body give me a break.‚Äù The daughter got visibly mad and the boy seemed upset. I didn‚Äôt have anything to say to that and for the rest of the time. I just bagged her groceries and left. Hurt my heart :(	"Probably rubbed the boys head just to say that, get the reaction, and try to push the ideas onto you aswell or get approval for their bad behavior
I'm rooting for our little dude from the grocery store. Hopefully the parent can learn to grow tf up and learn some fucking respect. People who act like this do not deserve to have children. Holy shit..
That's horrible, and I'm sick to death of transphobes doing that stupid ""When I was a kid I wanted to be a T-rex!"" bullshit, no you didn't, how fucking rude and condescending do you have to be? You're already saying you don't love him for who he is and that's horrible enough. I just hope his sister is supportive.
Ugh... boo üôÅ
What a witchüò°

That kid, Ugh I feel so bad for him
My face can't lie. If I'm at work I can't really rock the boat, but my face gives me away. Thankfully I'm self employed and don't give a fuck what comes out of my mouth.
jesus fucking christ that lady

I relate to the boy
\*Already high levels of anger increase\*

People like this mother are why you should have to take courses to be a parent.
poor guy. I hope he was a supportive environment with friends or at school :(
Ouch.
""Don't sell yourself short. *I* think you're a dog *now*.""
She didn't think she was a dog, she pretended to be a dog. That's not at all the same.

Wish some of the commenters would have emailed the judge in the family court who took my daughter from me and gave her to my parents for them raising ""concerns about my gender transition"" and that I have ""mental health issues"" and ""addiction to alcohol"" (both preceding statements are prior to hrt and hearsay in any case since the alcohol and drug specialist told me that I don't have any issues and they stemmed from external sources if I did have any (my parents and society)
Hopefully his sister will stand up for him.
Oh dear. Poor kids. Sorry you had to experience that.
This hurts my heart but I also understand the position you were in as an employee. I hope I never witness something like this, but if I happen to be a customer at the time I pledge to be a loudmouth so a store employee does not have to risk their job.
Pain.
Poor kid
That Mom is a shitty mom
People like this dont deserve children wtf, i hope the boy will be okay and his mom grows some common sense.
[Sasha] Poor little guy, I hope his mom changes for the better before he hits puberty or that he at least doesn't get stuck in a shit living situation till his 20's like has happened with us.
i feel so bad for him, ive had family members who say im a such a pretty girl and it breaks my heart this is happening to a little kid
[deleted]
‚ÄúAnd when I was a kid I wanted to be kind, but people like you showed me kindness doesn‚Äôt exist. Thanks for being an abuser mam. Wouldn‚Äôt want your kids to grow up in a welcoming world wouldn‚Äôt we?‚Äù *smile and let her bag her shit alone*

You don‚Äôt have to subject yourself to abuse. You‚Äôre too valuable for that. Stay strong üíï
We have a 14 year old boy who wants to be a girl but her parents can't pay for her clothes so my GF and I are helping her
That's when you look at the boy and say ""Well, I think you're a handsome young man."" or something like that. You're not having a conflict with the parents, you aren't doing anything wrong, and the boy gets some validation after the horrible thing his mother said.

And in my mind I would be thinking that the mom is a very handsome b!+¬¢h.
That‚Äôs pretty much how my mom treats me, it‚Äôs a little less childish, except I‚Äôm 18. 

She insists that I‚Äôm too immature to know who I am, and that because I‚Äôve had a lot of identity revaluations in the past 3 year that I‚Äôm being influenced. 

The thing is it wasn‚Äôt until I got my first boyfriend that I began developing a sense of self outside of her own projections. 

Passive aggressive parental abuse is the worst, except possibly physical abuse which she also partakes in.

Basically I feel for this kid and hopes he has a ally in his older sister and gets away from his bitch of a mom.
""Maybe you were right as a kid, because you sure are acting like a bitch right now""

but I also don't fear getting fired for talking shit to asshole customers
I‚Äôd have bitched her out but I doubt she would hav said that to me
Had I been in your shoes, I would‚Äôve made peace with losing that job and let that transphobe fucking hear it
why do people have to be like that :(
Oh for sure. I hate that people do this with shit they know should be wrong. If the wrong person nods and says ‚Äúyeah I agree‚Äù they redeem it as a good behavior ‚Ñ¢
no cuz the more masc i look or talk about my gender the more my mom says im her pretty little daughter
and even if they did, it's so stupid to equate wanting to be an animal with being trans
Well that's pretty rude to witches.
parenting licenses must be a thing.

you insult dogs with your comparison.

She's just an inflamed asshole and a bad parent.
Yes we do in America :/
Awwwü•∫
OP should've done the opposite and just shook their head. I'd do that by accident tbh
That's just going along with my point
Exactly
As a trans witch, I agree lol
Yes, love it. Let‚Äôs let a governing body determine who is allowed to reproduce. What could possibly go wrong!
Already told us she is starting to grow her hair
If you work in an environment like that and you react negatively to a customer who is definitely being transphobic to their children and you are the ‚Äúbasic employee‚Äù trying to correct their morals you can sometimes get in trouble for doing the right thing, sadly. The customer is always right, and if you involve yourself in any way personally you can get hurt. 

I don‚Äôt blame OP for how they responded. Working in grocery stores sucked ass and you get 10 of these gross opinionated people in a day, whether it‚Äôs saying their loud aggressive chihuahua is a trained service dog or a parent clearly verbally abusing their kid. Sadly this one just struck home. Yeah you can shake your head, or if it gets bad enough definitely get a manager over. But sometimes it‚Äôs better to just avoid the conflict and when you can‚Äôt get involved it sucks even more like this. Doing anything negative would have probably ended badly by how this mother sounded.

Edit: I‚Äôm an ex employee from a big grocery store chain and I don‚Äôt miss it

Also I‚Äôm so sorry I know you‚Äôre not blaming OP and I got a bit wordy there, I wish it was easier to defend people and not risk your job or personal livelihood.
yeah, thats what i meant dfhfjs
Transwitchion :0
If you're not gonna love the kid or take care of it then don't frakking have it. My point is there should be some standard for being able to be considered ""able to raise a child competently"" not just the current ""ah shit I had a pelvic sneeze, guess we gonna have a kid""
I don't blame OP either and it probably came out wrong the way I said it, sorry. My GM usually protects the employees tho which is apparently rare but if some loud mouth is being a dick she usually shuts them down by giving them free food just to get them out or telling them off.
LMAO
amazing lmao

I‚Äôm a nanny and I had a bit of a sad story from a kid (5) I was watching today. He just wanted to have fun and express himself.	"We were watching tv and he asked if I could put his favorite show on for him. I asked him what it was, he said Blippi and the he said he wasn‚Äôt actually allowed to watch it anymore because he (the kid) did something bad because of Blippi. I told him that I couldn‚Äôt let him watch it then if his parents didn‚Äôt let him. 

I asked him what he did to get in trouble and he said that blippi said it was ok to dress how you want, whether that was a girl or boy. He then dressed up like a girl and showed his dad. His dad got mad and told him to never do it again and that he shouldn‚Äôt do any girl stuff. The poor kid was scared to even have a glittery sticker on him because he‚Äôd seem girly‚Ä¶. The sticker was a tree. It‚Äôs so sad that his parents can‚Äôt just let him play with stuff regardless of if it‚Äôs ‚Äúgirly‚Äù or ‚Äúboyish.‚Äù Just let kids be kids."	"When I worked in childcare and I had a dad scream at me because his son had an Elsa dress on, he was wearing the dress because he could put it on and off himself, the child even said something along the lines of ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt like Frozen but I like that I can dress myself without help‚Äô. Weather it‚Äôs expressing yourself or just wanting some independence parents need to realise that there child isn‚Äôt going to be who they want, but that child is going to be there own person.
It's funny when TV shows are more human than the actual parents. One day child you will be allowed to shine.
Reminds me of the one time I ""presented"" girly as a Kid (5-6 at that time cant really remember), I just thought it was so much fun to wear my looooong T-Shirt like a dress. The reactions from literally everyone (who existed in my world back then) had a huge part in shoving me in the closet for the next 25years. 

Sad story, Hope one day Kids can just explore without being judged.
Aww poor kid.
All I know is that the princess dresses are always very popular with the boys at the daycare but did ‚Äòall‚Äô of them grow up to be trans because of that? Kids don‚Äôt see the boundaries and just want to try something different. It‚Äôs unbelievable that these strange parents go crazy about a tv show or their children dressing up from the dressing up box because they think their child might suddenly decide they are trans because of it. It‚Äôs obviously something deeper than that and not seeing a tv show won‚Äôt change anything. My parents were quite the opposite. I went to the beach in my sisters bathing suit when I was about 6 and my parents didn‚Äôt seem to care‚Ä¶.that was the 70s.
this is the ridiculous shit they‚Äôre talking about when they say ‚ÄúlIbErAl MeDiA iS tUrNinG oUr KiDs TrAnS‚Äù‚Äî a show saying something this innocent and benign üôÑ
This so so fucking sad. Their life will probably be so fucking hard with shit parents like those.
Blipi is one of those creators where they sound the way they sound because they are talking to kids, but somehow is watchable by an adult because Blipi isn‚Äôt being obnoxious. Sucks that happened.
Not letting kids be kids is bad enough, but that kid could be trans and then the parents reaction is forcing them to be something they're not and into a life of hardship, doubt, guilt, anxiety and depression that could easily end up killing them.

When will people stop being scared of trans kids?
Conservative parents be like:
Let kids be kids, stop indoctrinating them!

The second kids be kids:
BAN IT!! NO CHILD OF MINE WILL BE DOING THAT SHIT!!!
Well that's fucking sad. I relate.
Ugh, sadly, I can relate to that story üò¢
This kind of shit locked me in the closet until I was 49!
Welcome to my childhood however it wasn't my dad but a neighbors dad.
My son liked princess dresses as a preschooler. Would usually have one on when I went to get him from preschool. We bought some for his cousins for Christmas. He was upset because he wanted one too. My mom proceeded to sit him on her lap and explain why boys can‚Äôt wear princess dresses. I then proceeded to tell her if he wanted to wear princess dresses with size 13 pumps when he grew up it was fine by me! We did get him a princess dress, he eventually lost interest as he got older.
a kid that i used to somewhat babysit LOVES Blippi. i dont watch unless im hanging out with him but his mom is super lgbtq+ supportive. not sure how she figured out that i use he/him pronouns but she has never once misgendered me and treats me as one of her own kids. and as such, her son, one of my favorite little gremlins sees me as one of his older brothers. they have an older brother/son who has the same name as myself, so ig it isnt too difficult for them but at the same time with me having spent the majority of my life living and presenting as female and just recently going on t, loads of ppl have misgendered me. (all fully unintentional since they only hear my voice and not see me, i work at a mcdonalds ;)
Poor baby üò•
My parents would've yelled, grounded, and then insult me if I did that.
This was my childhood as a trans woman. I was just talking about it to my boyfriend this morning when I woke up . I wish I had a better child hood. I feel almost all of my trauma comes from my family
Reminds me of my childhood. Anytime I tried to present masculine, I got ridiculed and forced to go back into the closet. Why can‚Äôt parents love their kids unconditionally? Sure they say they do but it‚Äôs very obvious that their love has conditions.
My life.
This is so sad üòî
Aww poor kid, Blippi is ace, one of my kids watches him, some people are just horrible
If I became a father who could t be supportive of his children, I‚Äôd give up my dad card. I wish that child grows up to love themselves whatever they choose.
I did babysitting (I‚Äôm a teen, but I still babysat lol) and I had this one kid who was a little boy (at least at birth) he was 8 and I‚Äôm 14. He asked me a question, and he said ‚Äúdo you know why my mommy doesn‚Äôt let me watch the princes movies?‚Äù And I said ‚Äúoh.. I‚Äôm not sure buddy.. :(‚Äú and he tells me ‚Äúwell, one time we went to Disneyland and there was a place where you can become a princess and I got my sister to take me while my mommy and daddy were getting food and when they found out they got really mad‚Ä¶‚Äù and I was so sad I wanted to cry but then he continues ‚ÄúWhich princess is your favourite princess?‚Äù And I said ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre all very lovely, it‚Äôs hard to decide‚Äù (in case I didn‚Äôt choose his and made him sad) then he says ‚ÄúI really like Belle because she‚Äôs so pretty! Do you think I can be like her?‚Äù And I said ‚ÄúYou can be like whoever you want to be, kid! Your parents may not like it, but whenever you can get the chance, you should dress the way you‚Äôd like and be who you are! :]‚Äù he says ‚ÄúI guess so but my mommy and daddy will never let me..‚Äù and I say ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt have to live with them forever! I know it may be hard to wait so long, but once you‚Äôre out of there, you can be free to dress the way you want! Nobody can force you to not dress like belle when that day comes!‚Äù He then asks me ‚Äúhow much longer is that day? O:‚Äù and I say ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be 18 when that time comes, since you‚Äôre 8 that‚Äôll be just 10 more years!‚Äù He says ‚Äúoh but I‚Äôm actually turning 9 in a few months so that means it‚Äôs actually 9 years, right?‚Äù And I say ‚Äúoh! Then yes! 9 years!!‚Äù He starts getting really excited, his parents won‚Äôt come until midnight so he says ‚Äúwhile my parents are gone, please just this once will you let me do it right now?‚Äù And I was thinking about it, I thought ‚Äúhmm the parents will be mad.. but the kid really wants to be himself and this will be probably his only chance for a long time‚Ä¶‚Äù so I said ‚Äúalright.. just don‚Äôt mention it to your parents otherwise they‚Äôll be mad at the both of us üòÇ‚Äù and he was like ‚Äúyayy!!! Thank youuu!‚Äù And using his sisters old clothes (because she was 18 already I think but idk where she was) we played princess dress up! I put away the clothes nicely and hopefully made them look untouched and put the kid to bed before his parents got home. I probably made some bad decisions there but I just felt bad for the kid..
And they say we‚Äôre ‚Äúgroomers‚Äù, & that gender affirming care is ‚Äúchild abuse‚Äù. Hard to get more ‚Äúgroomer-y‚Äù than gender shaming & punishment for expressions of individuality. Not allowing your child to explore their personality/gender & organically discover their true nature‚Ä¶ because of the parent‚Äôs own prejudice & fear. THAT is child abuse. Poor kid is in for a rough go. Why does this culture ‚Äúshame‚Äù people for just being themselves? Horrible.
educate him about how UNIMPORTANT gender norms are. they have no place in society. this boils my blood. new school maybe?
I'm almost 24 and my parents still don't accept that. üòî
I'm 26 and my mom is still disappointed when I dress in male clothes üòÇ 
Idc tho and I will never come out until I can live on my own away from them so she'll just have to deal with it since it makes the dysphoria a little bit less *shrug*
It‚Äôs was sad. I just let him watch it.
Agreed
>Sad story, Hope one day Kids can just explore without being judged.

right?? they bitch about teenagers ‚Äúrushing into shit‚Äù and wanting to de-transition, yet they also won‚Äôt let these poor kids experiment with *anything* to even see how they feel about it first!
Yea I felt bad, because I‚Äôm not saying kid is trans but he got really upset when he told me about how he just thought it‚Äôd be nice to show his dad he could be pretty in make up and girl stuff. Then he said he didn‚Äôt mean it and that I didn‚Äôt need to tell his parents.
Well men in the 50s frequently wore full body bathing suits too. It's something they were already used to from when they were growing up.
>not seeing a tv show won‚Äôt change anything

absolutely! i grew up in the 90s and had no idea what transitioning even was and didn‚Äôt know anyone that was trans (that i was aware of, at least)

it didn‚Äôt stop me from crying hysterically when i started puberty and my mother told me it was time i started wearing a bra. i remember reading *Are You There God? It‚Äôs Me, Margaret* and all these years later, pretty much the only thing i remember about the book was being completely *baffled* by the scenes where she discussed how her and her other female friends wanted larger breasts, and they did the arm exercises while saying ‚ÄúI must, I must, I must increase my bust!‚Äù i remember thinking ‚Äúwhy would they want that? why don‚Äôt *i* want that? what‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù
Was expecting some horrible comment that got heavily downvoted because your comment was collapsed. Wtf Reddit?
Oh it‚Äôs the worst . I had parents like that AS A TRANS WOMAN. I pray for this child
Parents projecting their own insecurities on their children... smh
See that‚Äôs so dumb, I hope your parents stood up for you
Right! Just let kids be kids. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily MEAN ‚Äúanything‚Äù. But, it just MIGHT mean EVERYTHING.

Don‚Äôt let your own fears repress your children & stifle their growth! üôèü•∫
I'm 57 and my dad didn't misgender me for the first time this week, though not to my face. On the phone to my sister. She told me about it.
Damn, that‚Äôs rough. My only advice is to go no contact when you can and try to repair that damage, I was lucky that only my dad was like that.
Maybe not helpful but playing fem characters in a game and dressing them up nice can help me
Good on you. At least this kid can see one adult who doesn‚Äôt shame him for self-expression, and that can make a huge difference. I hope you don‚Äôt get into any problems from the parents.
These same parents will throw a fit if the child comes out at 15 because ""There weren't any signs! This is so sudden!"" Dumbass, you *taught* him when he was five that you weren't a safe person to express those signs to!
I remember wearing some eye shadow and women‚Äôs clothes to work, after college, at a sub shop.  

I remember my girl co-workers talking to each other, then laughing to each other.  They asked me if I was in theatre.  

It still hurts.
My parents we‚Äôre just very progressive and liberal. My older sister wanted a little sister that day so I obliged her request.
I have heard of ‚Äúwhere are you god, it‚Äôs me Margret‚Äù sounds like it was written by someone who was a teenager the 50s. üôÑ 

hope you are doing well now. 

In spite of my borrowed swimming costume escapades and some fondly remembered secretive experimentation in my early teens I didn‚Äôt feel it necessary to transition it clearly wasn‚Äôt my destiny. I do view trans people as their trans identity though.
So this is why this happens? Thanks! TIL
I mean when I came out a couple years ago the there was no signs comment happened and I was like.... really?! Ive been processing stuff in my head pointing out all the signs to myself. ü§î

It happened when they weren't there and at his house, I guess he didnt find need to snitch on me, but I am almost 100% certain my dad would gave agreed with him, but idk I repressed memories of him after he passed away, infact my oldest sister and i had a talk and i thanked her for standing up to him for me when i was younger and she said she had hoped I wouldn't remember cause he wasn't a good person, and my mom 1000000% would have stood up for me. 

When I told my mom I talked to her about moment's that I remember and that she didnt that stood out to me but she supports me. Funny thing is I talked to my wife and she was not surprised when I came out and then i tell her stories and she goes, ""how did you not know?""
Ngl that‚Äôs even better. It means he accepts your pronouns enough to use them where you may not hear about it not just as a performance for you
Tbh it's the reason I always play male characters yeah, if I can't be my true self yet irl at least I can be it in my games üòÑ
Yea, they give him all kinds of fake guns and teach him to play war. Then the second he wanted to do anything seen as girly he gets in trouble
yep. or they think people coming out at 40 who ‚Äúnever showed signs before‚Äù are just attention-seeking or something
That is so unbelievably cute
OMG cuuuuteüíû
you‚Äôre actually 100% correct. it was published in 1970 and written by Judy Blume, who was born in 1938 (so she was 13 in 1951). it‚Äôs a novel for middle-school-aged kids (those just coming into puberty, tweens basically). she‚Äôs written a lot of popular books and many of my peers at that age (those who enjoyed reading outside of school requirements, at least) knew of and enjoyed her books (for context, this was the late 90s/very early 00s). if you look her up, you may recognize the titles of some of her other novels.

and don‚Äôt get me wrong, i wasn‚Äôt criticizing the book. it has been many, many years since i read it, but i don‚Äôt remember disliking it at all. i just remember being so confused about that aspect of the protagonist‚Äôs (Margaret‚Äôs) narrative. apparently it is a common experience among cis girls to *want* their breasts to come in‚Ä¶ but obviously i wasn‚Äôt cis, so that kinda explains it, lmao. i just didn‚Äôt know it yet.
> i tell her stories, and she goes, ""How did you not know?""

Sometimes, we don't have the knowledge to pull on those threads and explore. If I knew what trans people were at 15, I probably would have explored why I wore one of my mom's bras all day with rolled up socks in it under my shirt for a whole day and it felt right. Instead, I didn't come until I was 21/22
Yeah thats the thing about my dad. He has never been anything but verbally abusive to me my whole life. Never a positive word, everything always a criticism, any ideas torn down or insulted, never a compliment, only insults, Never a ""that was good,"" only ""you're stupid"" or ""it's your fault"" even for things I had nothing to do with.

Over the years though I WOULD occasionally hear that he said something positive about me to OTHERS.

He has serious issues about that that go way beyond me being trans. I had to learn to accept decades ago that I would never get ANYTHING but abusive and critical language from him and it's not about me, it's about him.
Also if you can change your pronouns online, my PFP is my transition goal, I‚Äôve done the same with Discord and my pronouns here are She/her
That is... so fucked up... (fake gun comment)

It's wonderful that you let him watch it. You're a light in the darkness. (first comment)
The upbringing of basically all trans feminine people.
I‚Äôm sorry he‚Äôs like that. It sucks.
Thats how my dad is too, it was just me and him after my parents broke up when I was 12, and we lived (in a one bed flat where I lived in the front room so I had literally zero privacy) and worked together until I was 21.
Only just got my own place a few months ago and cut him out of my life, seems to have helped but idk.
I know how you feel :(
Sorry to hear that
Yeah same! Usually in the trans subs I have my pronouns in my flair and on discord I have them in my profile as well (and in my nickname as well until people are used to it). Since I changed them the people I hang out with online have been really respectful of them. Even tho my voice sounds nowhere near masculine but no one has misgendered me after I correct them once. I'm really glad about that üòÖ 
I should probably try some voice training at some point tho....since wait times here to even get hormones are years unfortunately..
I‚Äôd let my kids watch blippi, I‚Äôve never censored them on what they want to wear and I will never stop them from expressing their true selves.  

As a trans parent, I feel for this child.  It‚Äôs like my upbringing where I was kept in the closet thru parental shame.  

We do not let them have toy weapons.  That‚Äôs our line, it‚Äôs important that our kids don‚Äôt associate toy and weapon together. Seems like a better future.

I hope you get to keep watching this child, sounds like they will need supportive person like you as they get older."	120w5do	trans	1369	0.99	2023-03-24 19:53:25
Too ugly to be welcome in online trans spaces.	"I think I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm ready to give up on connecting with other trans people, especially other trans women.

Nearly every online trans group I‚Äôve been part of has devolved into a stupid high school drama popularity contest thing where beauty is the deciding factor, or was already like that from its very inception, and I‚Äôm finally tired of dealing with it.

I‚Äôm tired of the constant social reinforcement in these groups that constantly tells me I‚Äôm ugly just because of my weight, and then completely ignores me because of my ugliness, as if the only trans voices that matter are those of pretty, thin, white, cis-passing trans women.

I‚Äôve never felt wanted, or even welcome, among trans groups, and I‚Äôm about ready to completely distance myself from my trans identity, if not other trans people all together because of it.
I don‚Äôt need to associate with other trans people since I know from over 2 years of lived experience that I pass perfectly fine, despite how many trans people seem to view me as ugly.

So, why would I want to keep trying to connect with communities that clearly have no use for me? Why would I want to connect with other trans people at all, online or IRL, when my experience with them has been universally the same across all groups?

Before I wrote all this, I spent over an hour crying because of how lonely and isolated I feel among people who should be my peers, but don‚Äôt give a shit.

Now I‚Äôm just mad; at everyone else for making me feel this way, and myself for being so upset about it."	"I'm sorry you had to deal with people like that. This is one of the main factors behind my not sharing photos online, I like to connect with people in a way that is totally anonymous and free of visual prejudice. Sure, it doesn't solve the problem of people's shitty behaviour, but it does the trick to prevent it. I hope that you will be able to find decent enough people that accept you.
Edit : saw your line about being upset as if it's your fault. It most definitely ain't, so keep your head high.
I find this place to be quite welcoming though. There's people posting their photos but I usually don't look cause that's not for me. I just focus on myself and do my best üòä

I'm not sure if you ever follow DR Z PHD on YouTube but she is very genuine and commited gender specialist who posts lots of helpful content regarding our confidence and certain thought distortions that might affect us.

She also replies to comments with general helpful guidelines as she cannot dwell deeper as you arnt her patient and she doesn't know you enoough to go into specifics. I usually take these guidelines to my own therapist and I find it very helpful.

In fact, her most recent video covers ""what if I transition and I will be unattractive?"" which I found really useful. If you have the time and decide to check out her channel, I hope it can be helpful for you too üòä

It sounds like you need to get off some of those subreddits, especially ones like r/transpassing. Subreddits like that have a culture around reinforcing beauty standards, especially cis beauty standards. You don't have to ""pass"" or look cis to be beautiful. Trans bodies are beautiful. Don't give up on finding other trans women out there that don't have this toxic mindset or behavior. I know they are out there. They may not be easy to find in the groups you are part of, but they do exist.
Holy shit is this factual.
No harm to fellow trans women ofc, but it feels like a contest or popularity trope around them. With trans women for me personally feels like a pity circle, and the trans men I've met would push dysphoria on you like it was nothing. 

It's more than ok to take a break from talking to them, and you have to remember that you're allowed to be trans and not obsess on gender all the time, too much of it can lead to overthinking and self deprivation, just make sure all your conversations are beneficial to both you and the other party.
I do understand your feelings. I pulled back from Facebook some due to that very same reason. To so many, being trans is a beauty competition. It's like the same group post selfie after selfie multiple times a day. I mean, that fine I guess, but maybe they have such a low self-esteem that they need that constant validation. ...? I've found that meeting trans people like that in person, they often don't completely look like all the ""filtered"" pics they post lol.
It can be hard. There is the three occasional non thin, non cis looking or non white selfie in here and seeing those it's certainly good as they are still very good looking people regardless and also get praise from other people. They're not the majority.
But then again: most people that aren't meeting these standards are more hesitant to post photos and as such end up underrepresented. It's maybe a vicious cycle but yeah.
That's only speaking for online spaces like here not irl.
Also don't know if it even helps being aware of this but here it is
Alot of trans people who are focused on passing themselves pick apart those who are trying to do the same, they will do this as an escape to feel better about themselves. It's a huge cope and very toxic. I would pay no mind to them unless they have something constructive to say. In most cases cis people are the best people to get advice from since they dont care about little details that trans people hyper focus on. If you think you pass and cis people arent giving you shit about it what's the big hold up. The trans community might prefer this hyperfeminised version of societical misogyny to pass but you dont have to go this path. Just be yourself women dont have to take a certain form to pass.
You literally just look like a cis girl
It sucks how often I hear about this. I‚Äôm very new to this community despite learning and knowing about the practical/explicit information (i.e transition, surgeries, costs, chemicals‚Ä¶). Its sad that this is such a prominent problem that people don‚Äôt feel safe or comfortable around people who should know the experience and challenges of also searching for the ‚Äúsame crowd‚Äù. I hope you know that it‚Äôs okay to be upset. Don‚Äôt blame yourself for other peoples‚Äô problems. Listen to your favorite music! Watch your favorite show again! I don‚Äôt particularly like crying, but supposedly the human process of crying releases ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù chemicals that give you relief after the act. So‚Ä¶ have fun with that? Whatever you need to do to feel better, do it! (On the total trust I‚Äôm giving you that it is probably healthy, but I‚Äôm not judging)
Hey Girl! You look nothing else than a woman to me, and you‚Äôre beautiful too. I‚Äôm not sure the problems come from beauty contests, cause you would have been in. 

And now, I‚Äôm not an expert, maybe it‚Äôs just normal, but I see you also post nude pictures. This is one thing that can really scare me off online, I wouldn‚Äôt do it. Moreover because there was a post a few days ago about pictures taken from trans-subreddits that were put up on transphobic websites.

Don‚Äôt be sad, you will find kind people within the community, because there are. And I wouldn‚Äôt participate to the ‚Äúbeauty-contest-situations‚Äù, you don‚Äôt have to prove yourself, you‚Äôre beautiful!
Some people can get caught up in their own success and not realise how lucky they are and forget where they came from. This sadly happens everywhere with everything. Jobs... Money... You don't want friends like that.
I identify with but don't associate with LGBTQ+ because of this.
Don't worry you are not alone. If you are looking for friends feel free to PM me. I'm a big pc gaming nerd who's early on in mtf hrt!
Unfortunately, life for all women is pretty much a popularity contest where beauty is the deciding factor, it's not just trans spaces.

I don't know how old you are, but a lot of online trans spaces just have people that are really young. They haven't experienced much, so they don't really know much about empathy or kindness. I promise you that as you get older, SOME people have learned that life is more than looks.
I'm truly sorry you're feeling like and have been treated like this. There seems to be so much unchecked internalised transphobia in some online trans spaces that really allows some to be so cruel to others and try to enforce rigidly defined acceptable parameters for being trans and how to look and/ or present, and that is awful and disgusting. We should be supporting each other in however we experience and express our gender, and however we look, which is all subjective nonsense anyways. There do seem to be some more supportive and positive on here, but I understand you need to do what you need to take care of yourself. Love and solidarity ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§
You should join Trans safe space on discord. They are so welcoming and so helpful. I think you shouldn't hide who you really are.
I'm sorry it's been that way for you, i personally haven't been in places that made people who look less attractive feel unwelcome, at least not that I noticed, but I understand that a lot of circles can feel like that. It seems like it's not just in the trans communities, there are just a lot of groups who value that a lot.

I must add that I've looked at your profile and those who called you ugly have shit tastes, because you're beautiful. But even if you weren't beautiful that's still just wrong to treat people like that, I'm sending love.
I totally understand what you mean about not feeling welcomed. Before my egg cracked, I never felt welcome in lesbian spaces for much of the same reason.

If you ever need someone to talk to, my DMs are always open.

Also, looked at your profile and saw that you're a nerd and a writer! If you're ever interested in nerdy RP (literate, not erotic), hit me up. Our group is really welcoming and inclusive, with several trans people and we don't accept shitters so things don't get toxic.
Hello, trans lurker for a while here. I've had some pretty similarly bad experiences here myself as well -

I've tried to reach out to both trans communities and individuals before also in regards to advice and just trying to help figure myself out, and I've either been flat out ignored or gatekept in the very first instance for not already knowing enough about being trans. I can't even accurately describe my gender identity, and I've tried researching transness before but it often feels like so many people in these communities refuse to help or offer advice because they had to struggle with it also, so heaven forbid that someone else gets to do it without the hard work!

So here I am, trying to figure it out alone, not knowing what to research, not feeling welcome in trans spaces because I don't know how to speak about my identity without, I guess, talking about it in the wrong terms, and getting no help from anyone. I've tried reaching out on this sub but don't even get a single comment or upvote on what would be hugely affirming or helpful questions, so I've just deleted them all lol.

I also feel like ""Do I pass?"" should not be an encouraged question, because you're reducing the trans experience down to, as OP puts it, the aesthetics of the transition as the ultimate end-goal. Yes, passing can offer safety in what is otherwise a shit fucking world and security in ones own perception of their self, but if passing is normalised as the end-goal of being trans, so many people who can't get the help to reach that point or can't pay out of pocket on techniques to masc/fem are shit out of luck, and told that their own transition is illegitimate. If not expressly, than definitely subversively.

Ultimately it makes communities like this feel clique-y, when that's the last thing any of us need.

Sorry to offload like this, and it would be great if I'm the only person who has these issues - but I don't think I am.
Hey it's gonna be alright. They should not have treated you like. They didn't have the right to. I have no doubt that you look like an amazing person. You are valid. Don't give up.
People in general are / can be really terrible. The same things drive awful behavior no matter where it is found. Fear, anger, jealousy, loneliness, etc. 

It‚Äôs a sad thing to say deal with or ignore it and even worse to try and turn the other cheek or rise above such behaviors when it seems that does nothing to improve anything. 

But it does, be the change you want to see in others and treat others as you want to be treated. These aren‚Äôt just sayings as in a world so seemingly filled with negativity every person can have a chance to be a little less crappy to someone else and help make the world suck a little less each day

It‚Äôs okay to vent and be angry u/flirtynerdygirl and even though I‚Äôm just some random message in the dark internet 

Hello there! And have a nice day ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Hi!  I have a very small discord with a few trans people, were very supportive of each other.  Dm me if you want to know more, we'd love to have you.
Sorry to hear you feel this way hun. Feel free to DM me if you want. No matter what, you'll always have my support. Keep being you x
Yeah the push too look as pretty and fem as possible is really bad and i dislike it, i am 2 meters tall and broadly build so i'm never gonna look feminine and fit in with peoples ideas of how trans girls should look but i have accepted that and i'm just gonna be me, a big buff trans girl. Btw you can dm me if you want someone too talk too
I'm so sorry that has been your experience.  I've noticed that there's at least a sub-section of people who don't accept trans people who don't pass because they believe it reflects poorly on them and we really need to stamp that mentality out.

We have transphobic ideas within our own heads and we need to ACTIVELY work to undo that. Some people aren't willing to put in that effort. You're valid, you're wonderful and I hope you find that safe space.
This really had little to do with the trans community and is more a reflection on society as a whole. Most communities, especially online, are extremely toxic. High school doesn't end at graduation and humans can be truly awful.

It's best to take a step back and curate the people you allow close. They don't have to be trans themselves to be allies.

Look for people based on their attitudes and not their tribes.


Hang in there!
Disclaimer I ain't trans, but am here to help support my trans nephew (ftm). I am so sorry you feel this way, especially from the group you should be accepted. Just know you are beautiful in your own right inside and out.  Don't ever feel put down, you are amazing in your own right. Just keep being yourself and try and ignore any hatred.
Unfortunately, being trans does not cure people from being affected by cis heteronormative standards. Trans spaces also are going to tend to be cesspools of bodily insecurity, and one of the easiest ways for the insecure to temporarily feel better about themselves is to put others down. Also also, and I say this as a very big girl myself, big girls are largely invisible to society. If you want to be seen and validated, that‚Äôs a huge problem. If you want to go about your business without being bothered, then it‚Äôs a feature, not a bug.
I think that‚Äôs why I gravitate more towards GNC folx
üíï
Oh no, I am so sorry you had to deal with this! The human form is something that should never be trivialized to 'standards of beauty' because those standards are almost impossible to achieve! Please do not be discouraged and try to find a community that loves you for you.
post photos in a good cosplay, everyone is super cute in a cosplay.
There are a few things I‚Äôve learned over the years.  The first is that just because somebody is trans doesn‚Äôt mean they are a good person.  The second is that if you look hard enough you will eventually find your crew.

My take on this is that you are probably making friends with the wrong people.  It might be worthwhile to consider changing your approach to finding trans spaces.  

Personally, I think online only spaces can often get dominated by bad faith actors, especially if they are big and do a lot of gate-keeping.  I‚Äôm not saying all online spaces are bad, but the better ones Imo tend to be smaller cliques of people who are good friends, and will imo those spaces will rarely be *just* trans people or *just* women.

Most of the friends I have found that have been genuinely good friends, I made irl by going to in-person trans support groups.  I‚Äôd make a friend through that, then hang out with that friend outside of that space, and then I‚Äôd meet their friends and reject until I had a crew I felt were good for me.  And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a good crew that was *just* other trans women.
Personally I disregard the opinions of those who really don't know better like the people you are describing, they have deeper issues that being attractive on the outside wont cover up; And especially those who think that being Trans is something to be ashamed about with their twisted and false, unethical and socially destructive concepts of beauty and passing altogether.

I know that true beauty has nothing to do with appearance or form whatsoever and instead is who we are deep down within these vehicles we call bodies.

Passing for beautiful based on exterior factor or money, privilege and views around what makes us good enough to be universally accepted and so on is something that not only trans people are subjected to but all people who feed off of media in general and it's part of a major problem the world over.

All humans by design are perfectly beautiful and valid; But when we force the ideas that passing means you can walk down a dark alley at night and etc or expect others to be ok with whatever body parts we have - with no regard to experience, conditions, circumstance and even human rights or desires it's these restrictions that force the world into darkness and exclude those of us who only want to improve the understanding of what is means to be unique and human; and even contribute to the numbers of trans, non-binary, queer, intersex and gender diverse murders and suicide or worse.

It's not all bad though, But to accept this very ugly and rampant side of wanting to be our best self both internally and externally we should offer at least compassion for those who succumb to the unequal, dangerous and unrealistic pressures of life under the thumb of media but we don't have to be as bad as them and drink the kool-aid. These platforms or any cover ups used to create external beauty (surgery included) are why I have at my worst times loved reddit, because we can fuel our darkness and sadistic personas- I wouldn't recommend it though. Besides all this there is nothing wrong with wanting to seem truly beautiful but you wont be untill you can learn what real beauty really is.

Stay beautiful,

Belle
Yeah. So my thing is I had a friend and we did stuff from time to time but like she was catty in moments, like she was always trying to prove she was better than me. As someone who has two deployments to Afghanistan and other experiences that were also rough, I don‚Äôt care to be competitive over minute stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter. Regardless, I recently went out with this chick and her other trans friends. Her friends barely spoke to me and then they were going to smoke weed in front of a malls entrance. I didn‚Äôt want to do that because you know I‚Äôm like 28 and have a nice job? But hey they didn‚Äôt seem to give a shit about any of that. 

I have yet to have any good experiences with other trans women in person (besides my one friend who ghosted me for 6 months). 

The sad part is we need to be allies politically and set a standard that the younger generation can follow.
Those are some fucked up experiences. That really sucks!

But there are less shitty trans circles. If you feel it's still worth the effort, you can find them in your area too, I'm sure.

Side note: Are you from Germany? The German trans scene is awful and what you're saying reminded me of it.
Thank you for sharing. I've been feeling similarly and have also removed myself from the local trans community. I feel left out while the most passable/pretty trans women in my community are also the most popular. In fact, it feels like everyone lusts after them. I wonder how common this is.
Oftentimes when we receive weird vibes/responses from people, it has nothing to do with us, rather it‚Äôs a projection of their own issues onto us.  I‚Äôm not speaking for all trans women, but I have read about some who get dysphoria from other trans women, as they have this idea of how they‚Äôll turn out, and when they see different possibilities/outcomes other than what they‚Äôve imagined they get scared, and try to avoid those possibilities, cuz it doesn‚Äôt fit into their ideas/dreams for themselves.  I get where you‚Äôre coming from, but not everyone is like this, and perhaps the ones that are happen to be alone and sad too. 

Hope this helps, at least I was trying to here :)
Though I‚Äôm not trans (I‚Äôm a tubby cis gender femboy and I know it might annoy or offend transgender people that I‚Äôm commenting here) but I would say that looks are nothing to be worried about as people online shouldn‚Äôt have a say in how you feel. Sorry for waffling but what I‚Äôm getting at is that if you feel comfortable with how you look then that‚Äôs all that matters <3
you should come post in r/agender or r/NonBinary. a lot of us don't necessarily ""pass"" as male or female, and we're definitely not all up to regular beauty standards, and *thats fine*. even as a trans woman, your only focus shouldn't be on how trans women see you. fuck them if they don't accept you or want you. 

also, as a fat person, you have nothing to worry about weight-wise. you are legit curvy and all the more adorable for it.
Honey.....I know its hard but just be you....im 6'3"" and am have a very ""masculine"" build....I've been watching Cis women since I was 5 yrs old....in my estimation there is not a woman out there that is in the top 0.5 percent of women considered to be ""perfect"". What ever that is.....look around whenever u are out....I get dysphoric all the time about what I look like verses what I want to look like.....if you want to chat feel free to msg me
Don't try to belong in a group that won't accept you in the way you are already. Give love only to those who deserve it.
Huh, I've never had issues on the discord servers I'm on. I'm sorry to hear that though, it's tough to feel good about yourself anyway with dysphoria and I hate that they put you down to feel better about themselves.
Yeah the reason those groups caused so much drama wasn‚Äôt because they are trans, some people are naturally drawn to wanting drama for some reason. Most of the other trans folk I know try there best to avoid drama
I feel the same way. Honestly I just want some friends to chat with and game with. Idc how far along you are in your transition or how you look. If you have a good personality I'll love ya anyways. :33

Edit: Also. I think I'm ugly and def not even close to passing myself. But I'm told I'm not so you're probably not either. Self confidence issues on top of dysphoria is a monster
I have personally never experienced this, but, the furry community is a great online space for trans people, its not only trans people, but theres a lot of trans people there you will meet. And there's generally no transphobia, unless you find the odd splinter group filled  of rejects.
Sorry that is happening to you. I am looking for trans friends, I would love to chat. I looked through your pictures and I think you are cute. Haven't started HRT yet, but I plan on it.
I am so sorry you feel that way. You are beautiful, even if other people don't think so. Everyone is beautiful in their own way.
You ain't ugly at all. People can be toxic regardless of gender. Dealing with the toxicity of society is a lesson that is harder for some of us to learn...I often cannot handle it and will go through long periods of hermitic isolation. There are plenty of folk offering friendship and counsel in this thread, but if you have need of me I am here ·õ´·ö®·ö®·ö®·öπ·õñ·õí·ö®·ö®·ö®·õ´
The Discord for this very subreddit, as well as trans-friendly furry Discord spaces, if you're into that, never pull this shit from what I've experienced.
Girl you aren't even fat. Fuck them
Your a absolut Beauty
oh yeah it's just like that, You just gotta kinda be your own party and enjoy you and everything you like and not rely on others, and if someone wants to join in on your party then that's alright, but don't ever try to fit in friendo. If the friendship was meant to be it was meant to be but you don't need to be someone you're not, I mean you already know that because you're trans, but when it comes to people, being genuine about yourself gets you where you need to be with people who like you for who you are and yeah it sounds cliche but it became a cliche for a reason.

Find your people, they're out there, you haven't met all 7 billion of these humans yet.
dont say such bad things about yourself, you can be beutiful in your own way.
First of all, I'm sorry you experienced that, being treated as an other by people who are supposed to be there for you is painful and I know it can be demotivating in so many ways... I'm here for you.

Secondly, I see the pictures you have on your reddit. I don't mean to be weird or rude but you're beautiful, please don't tear yourself down and especially don't let others tear you down. 

I hope I managed to help, feel free to send me a message if you want to talk. I'll respond as soon as I can. Have a wonderful day.
>Says she's (perceived as) ugly

Maybe I should look at the post history

>Is heckin cute

*confused gay sounds meme*

Honestly, I'm sorry for what's up.  Life isn't perfect.  The internet is full of misguided people and bad actors.  Even I, the epitome of perfection in every way (do I really need an /s here?), sometimes act in ways I later regret.  

Plus I've read about how these forums tend to be filled with newer trans folks.

I wish I had some way to give more than just words through a series of tubes.  I'm sorry that I don't.

I can only try to support folks like you and me, and help shine light in these communities when I have the strength.  

So chin up, take it from me, the girl with the ugly knees: those who would tear you down don't deserve your comradery.
I just don't place a strong value patriarchal beauty standards. I would be nice to pass and be pretty, but ultimately my energy goes into looking cool.  I have control over that and it's much more rewarding. I am witchcraft!

I hate that our community feels the need to punch down at each other. In the end we are all in the same typhus infected discrimination ship of the imagination.
Gatekeeping trans communities are just the worst. Being transphobic against people just because they dont fill their beauty standard is just ridiculous.
I'm sorry you are treated that way!  You're definitely not ugly and your body is perfect the way it is.  They are missing out! And you're better off without their condescending attitudes üíôüíô
I don‚Äôt want to invalidate your experience at all, but there are shitty people in every community. Just because someone shares your trans experience doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre a good person, or that their opinions are right. And the way they treat you does not reflect the entire community. So I really hope that a few asshole people won‚Äôt cause you to reject your identity. Your identity is your own. Don‚Äôt let people ruin it for you. I truly hope that you can find a safe space with other (non asshole) trans people.
seeing your pictures and this post makes me feel awful for you. you're so so so so gorgeous and beautiful, what sort of super model spaces were you in that that's ugly? ;-; I'm so sorry you had to deal with shit groups/people.
I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. Calling someone ugly is uncalled for and wrong no matter the situation. Especially when calling peers ugly. They were all a-holes and petty jerks. In my opinion, all trans women are beautiful, unless they're jerks. No matter what they look like, they're beautiful. But trans women who treat other trans women like how they treated you? They're the ugly ones. You seem like a very beautiful and kind soul. I'm sending hugs hun, I'm here if you ever need to rant
Oh that sounds awful sorry you have to deal with that
Pretty is not the rent you have to pay to exist and live authentic to yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I highly recommend both Transpeak and Trans Community Center discord server, they are both great
Yeah it hurts, ita real beauty centric.
I searched this sub out tonight just to see how things are going. I used to follow, i used to follow lots of trans subreddits. I used to subscribe to trans youtubers and seek trans people on dating apps.
I had thought trans people would forever be around me, the community would be around me but that has not happened.
Im sure my unattractiveness has played a role, and me not being into girls has played a role.

I love trans people, i dont really feel mad at 'the community', but in the end, i dont think 'the community' is for everyone.

My goal in transitioning is to be a woman, my goal is not to be a trans woman. I love being a trans woman, its neat and kinda unique, but i dont usually feel the need to participate and the further along i get, the more i like blending in.
This way works for me, im happy, and again i love trans people especially because i know the pain..
So, I looked at your profile, and I have no idea what these other people are talking about. You are fucking beautiful. Wouldn't bat an eye at even thinking you were trans as all. You got one pass, and for two look amazing doing it. Fuck the haters.
Hey, a trans man here who is a femboy as plus sized, I totally understand you. I personally haven't gone to many places expept here, because of my introversion and lack of initiative, but I definetly still have those insecurities and know how devastating it can be when ither trans people put you down or don't accept tou because of your looks or weight. I can be your hypeman if you ever need one, or a listening ear.
~~I looked through the comments on some of your posts and nearly all of them seem positive (or at least positive for the subreddit). Based on this post and some of your others I might recommend you find a therapist. It seems like you have low self esteem~~ I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I might recommend therapy
I'm sorry to hear that, you're super gorgeous, but yeah I've definitely felt that if you're not a thin white waif that passes perfect you don't belong or belong as much.
~~welcome to the world of human nature. They‚Äôre all nasty and spiteful, just like the rest of humanity.~~

Unfortunately, lots of people have insecurities that can compel them to act in certain ways that they otherwise might  not. I‚Äôve  never tried to interact with anyone because I already know just how I would be treated. That‚Äôs a combination of personal worries and historical precedent.

im way too old to pass, way too old to be deemed attractive even by the most desperate.

You might be better off simply disengaging from it all.

I've seen alot of toxicity from the LGBTQ community that I'm just willing to distance myself from it. It can be so superficial, racist, disconnected from reality and overall unfriendly if you don't fit their narrative, its sickening.
It‚Äôs what happens when you put a bunch of people whose main life goal is to move past the one commonality they all have. Like being in high school.

It‚Äôs not about your appearance tbh. No matter how you look, there will be people who are passive aggressive because of the high percentage of trans people insecure about passing that take it out on others (subconsciously). I would say I‚Äôm conventionally ‚Äúpretty‚Äù but still don‚Äôt feel welcome in these spaces.
Gurl you look good.

You are not ugly.
You are chubby, a trait what was consider for 1000th of years very sexy.
I am chubby myself and I have never felt something like this in my LGBT+ community.

I guess it depends where you are from, but this had nothing todo with the lgbt+ community itself.
From my personal experience, a lot of trans girls do the beauty contest thing out of performative femininity to be more easily accepted by the outside world, in real life most people just see no facial hair, boob, and girl clothes and assume girl no matter how you look. I do this to myself a lot because of dysphoria to the point that i shave my full body daily but I make sure not to do it to others because that‚Äôs just rude. I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with the shittier part of the community.
Maybe stop posting in subreddits that slander us like r/traps‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this issue, it really should be all inclusive
I know you probably want to be around other trans people because you can relate but don't feel like you need to be friends with every trans person. Trans people can be assholes too, you'll find the right group of friends eventually. Sorry you are going through this. I felt left out in my high school trans group because I was the only overweight one and I was pretty much ignored all the time because of it. I eventually told them that I no longer wanted to be friends and I found the right people to be friends with. You don't have to subject yourself to their asshole behavior. You deserve better
I mean, based on your profile, you're definately not ugly. But even so, ugly folk should still have a place here. I. Sorry that assholes have made you feel unwelcome
I'm so sorry this has all happened. For what it's worth, from your pictures, I think you're beautiful as you are. You don't need the noise from those assholes trying to tell you otherwise.

It's not your fault. You shouldn't be mad at yourself for being upset about it, you're right to be upset. This is absolutely unacceptable.
I'm so sorry you had to deal with that all, it sounds horrible. Judging people for their looks is horrible and I can't possibly fathom how fellow trans people would do that as well, since a lot of us know just how it feels to struggle with looks. A lot of us are here should you ever want someone to talk to <3
I'm sorry. Weight is a horrible burden. It's because it's unhealthy, that it's not attractive. Like how sane people will find too thin people unattractive too.
People suck, trans people at the end of the day are people just like everyone else. We have short comings, biases, and all the other human things. Look at Caitlyn Jenner, what an awful bitch.
I don't understand the weight or looks bit. I just looked at your pics and you're average or thinner than the average woman where I'm from. What spaces are you in that don't have diverse bodies? You look pretty to me. Is it possible that people are just being jerks to be jerks? I don't think it's your looks.
I do. Among cis people.

I wanted to find that type of acceptance among people more like me, but apparently I don‚Äôt deserve it.
I LOVE Dr. Z! She has really made a difference in how I'm seeing myself during my medical transition ‚ù§ and she always answers comments/questions!
Thank you for the recommend, I'll be watching this after work <3
stg I pass better irl than on r/transpassing
I'm convinced at this point that r/transpassing is just mostly frequented by transphobes who have found that it's one of the few spaces on Reddit where they can ridicule trans people without getting banned. 

Imo at this point it's just an outlet for trans people to go mentally self harm by posting there.
That place is literally the second worst online ""trans community"" there is behind only 4chan
I definitely only see this online, although I suspect that's largely because I'm old, and this attitude is more commong among younger people that I don't really interact with elsewhere.
Lol well a lot of the online trans community is people who‚Äôve recently come out and if you think about it it‚Äôs like a huge group of teenage girls‚Ä¶. So‚Ä¶ not surprising that it‚Äôs a popularity contest lmao
This is honestly the primary reason I avoid filters. To avoid setting unrealistic expectations for myself and for others. I‚Äôd personally rather learn to love myself as I am now rather then an ‚Äúidealized‚Äù version of myself that may or may not be possible.
That's a shame really, I'm hoping you are having a better experience on this board. While I do often take selfies - the selfies in question are for my own personal journal rather than sharing on the internet (I have shared a small handful) What I also find helpful is that any selfie that is submitted here is always held under review before it circulates, that way (unless they flair it as filtered/faceapp) the overly filtered pictures (or more nefariously, pictures of cisgender women/men) are less likely to be posted on this subreddit.
Because such a huge part of being trans is appearances due to societal norms makes it very easy to become obsessed with appearances.  Looks aren't all a trans person struggles with but it's a big chunk so we overly focus on it. And it's an online forum so it's easier to criticize and be hurtful to somebody because you see them as a profile not a living being with feelings. And you're so right about cis people. They will look at the whole picture instead of focus on the tiny details that we tend to get caught up on.


Also to add. When you're ""cis passing"" it turns into more of wow ok you're pretty. Rather when you're ""trans passing"" and it's like ""OMG you look SOOO GOOD"".  As if it means more to be beautiful when you're trans than cis.
Makes total sense

Like you want to be prideful but it's hard since you're image gets associated with the people using it in a shitty fashion
Being bi, I was used to being shit on in queer spaces even before my egg cracked lol
Same. Like, I do my best to support my fellow queers, but fuck do I not want to hang out with a lot of them.
Very much this. We haggard, middle-aged tr***ies don't really give a crap what you look like, as long as you turn down the music, feel OK being your authentic self, and stay off our lawns.
seconding support groups! look for lgbt centers that are at least semi-local, but a lot of them do have online resources if you can't make it in person
Twitter
This is kind of her point, right? She's complaining that being attractive is a requirement for validity in online trans spaces, and you're telling her that *she's attractive enough to be valid.*
Ever consider that the other spaces they're talking about are... outside of Reddit? They just said online spaces, they never specified Reddit. You're being kind of invalidating.
Sad thing is, a lot of them are my age.
Welp, DM me if ever you need support, a chat or a virtual hug. I'd be happy to lend an ear
You do deserve acceptance, no matter if you pass or not. You are no less of a woman than any other trans or cis woman. Beauty doesn't define your womanhood
You do deserve it.
You deserve Allll of the good things üå∏
Me too, its like she answered questions I never knew I'd face or have answers to what I'm facing now.

But as with all therapy, it takes a willingness to want to try otherwise it's useless. So far she has been very helpful in providing the information that is important for me at that time.
Because that sub is full of douchebags.
Don't tell /r/transpassing that you can't accurately judge if someone passes from photographs /s
100% in agreement. 

I got told there that my face passes but my body doesn't and that I looked like a cross-dresser. And then when I told them I disagreed with their comment, I got downvoted. 

What doesn't make sense though is that my post did really well. I got 200 upvotes but all the comments where saying my outfit sucked and my body didn't pass.
I have to remind myself really frequently that r/trans and r/traaa skew *really* young. Like, babies compared to my 30-yo ass. Aside from occasional really intense political beliefs I won't touch with a pike, a lot of them seem really concerned with being conventionally attractive by cis standards... Standards that most cis women also don't meet.
Yes!!!!! Same here
Oh yes, I like it here and a few other Trans reddit pages also! I'm not against selfies, but on Facebook its literally girls posting a half dozen selfies, EVERY day lol.. I havnt really seen that here ..
also counter point i feel like i get asked a lot by cis ppl ""when do i present femme?"" whenever i tell ppl im trans and im like yo i am literally right now (wearing tshirt and jeans, no makeup).
Isn‚Äôt it ridiculous? It‚Äôs like: 

oh trans girl sad? You‚Äôre so hott!! 

Are you happy now?
It wasn't my intention to be invalidating, I'm sorry if I came off that way. I stand by my recommendation of them getting therapy though.
Is the negativity coming from people in person or online? I‚Äôm in quite a few trans online spaces and it‚Äôs almost always very positive. I‚Äôve never seen what you‚Äôre describing. I‚Äôm not trying to invalidate your experience, just want to figure out where it‚Äôs coming from! Maybe so I can avoid those places too‚Ä¶
Need to accept not everything deserves acceptance 

Lip service & baseless compliment‚Äôs to make someone feel better is a waste of time.

When you have some coworker trying to get you fired for there partner feeling self conscious being ugly with body hair like a Sasquatch. When you don‚Äôt even interact or stare at them much less want to be aware of there existence you will understand there are cases that don‚Äôt deserve kindness

Simply trying to have me fired just before my own surgery this august is BS. I don‚Äôt even know them but there both overweight 5 ft range weeabo, classic textbook walking comedy, both with long beard and neck hair that somehow grows out all the way down to he collar bone. Literally I feel like there both so unfortunate one decided to transition and hookup with a distant relative of the same misfortunes.


Only having the matter put my lifelong plans at jeopardy just prior because these two having baseless claims telling my general manager I don‚Äôt want to work there anymore, and I don‚Äôt help them. Despite being one of the three individuals at the same time pulling there slack from how useless they truly are as a coworker. among a dozen other childish bs claims.

I don‚Äôt even have a the patience to share all the details just know people like these don‚Äôt deserve pity
It's because they're baby trans people, and haven't figured out how to exist outside of those beauty standards. Which is legit! We've all been there, but that phase *is* kind of annoying to be around if you're well past it.
Crickey, that is pretty bad. Just glad I'm not on Facebook
Yeah I mean I dont wear makeup and dress butch, doesnt mean I dont pass as a woman? Like what women have to be feminine and prissy like a princess to pass? If you answered yes that's what you call 'internal misogyny'
I do have low self-esteem.
Which isn‚Äôt helped by all of this.
It‚Äôs online. On Twitter.
Which may be the worst, most popularity contest place for anyone to be.

It‚Äôs also not overt negativity as much as it is lack of positivity.
Girls like me typically go ignored when it comes to compliments and reassurance in favor of hyping up the same dozen or so big profiles run by the aforementioned young, thin, pretty, white, cis-passing girls, and those girls only talk to and hype up each other. 
It‚Äôs like they think the rest of the trans community exists in their orbit.
ya, it's definitely more difficult, and until you know me you might not assume i'm trans. vOv
Yeah I mean I dont even try to ""pass"" in the eyes of society cause it favors those who are small and petite, with a squeaky voice and dress all the same. I'm practically the opposite and stick out like a sore thumb. Might as well just embrace it rather than trying to hide it."	tgy4zl	trans	1148	0.92	2022-03-18 10:18:58
Just got deadnamed in front of my homophobic class (mtf 17)	"So, i just got misgendered by the substitute in my most homophobic class of the day in the worst way possible. She was calling role, and when she came to my name she said my deadnamed, and paused. I wasn't paying attention because I'm not used to it, but everyone stops talking. Then, she repeats it,looks me dead in my eyes and says ""You're *deadnamed*, right?"" 

She looked mad at me too...


I just want to curl up and cry, I've been dealing with some serious dysphoria since yesterday and this has made everything fucking way worse

Edit: I generally know how to handle these things, but thanks for the advice. Today has just been a rough day in totality, and that really didn't help. This post may be removed soon though because of the hateful DMS and comments I've been receiving. If me venting about an experience that upset me under the vent tag upsets you that much, then I think you're far more sensitive than me.

Edit 2: The substitute is very regular, and I've had her multiple times. She doesn't respect my name."	"I can only imagine the reasons she was mad for you responding to roll call is either not know and thinking you were ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù, simply hates you for being trans, or some combination of both.
This happened to me on my first day of classes. My solution: don't respond to it. It isn't your name. Speak with the teacher after class to correct them and make sure they mark you as present.

I am really sorry this happened to you. I hope you're doing okay. You're very strong for being out and presenting at this age, in this particular climate, I hope things go better next time.
Teachers like this are honestly the worst, seemingly only existing to spite their students.  
When I was in school, I would spite all the students I disliked, but I feel like I'd make an exception for this teacher...and no doubt get sent to the principle for saying ""Sorry Mr. Dickhead""
I know this is a stretch, but does your school have any policy that supports trans youth using a chosen name? You could report them.

If that‚Äôs not an option, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in a tricky position. Regardless having a class full of bigoted kids and a teacher equally bigoted that all know your deadname sounds terrible. I hope you can go to someone in your life who can support you.
""No, I'm *chosen name.*""

The end.
report that to your school officials.  they can blacklist her from ever subbing there again (assuming they support you)
I'm going to say this in the most polite way I can this morning....fuck her! I would have said my name is x thank you, but I forgive you. People can be so shit sometimes. Hugs Honey
Misgender them back. Call them by a wrong name or their maiden name even. Lol

edit: /s but when they've done it multiple times, let them swallow their own medicine.
I wasn‚Äôt there so I don‚Äôt know full context but is it possible your deadname was simply what was listed on the attendance sheet? If it was truly malicious then fuck him, but I‚Äôve had people deadname me simply because they didn‚Äôt know or had old info on me. It feels awkward af and makes me slightly uncomfortable but I have to remember it was an accident and simply politely correct them. It‚Äôs only unless they refuse to accept the correction that I let myself get upset with them. Same thing with gendering, some people have used ‚Äúhe‚Äù for me but only because they were strangers and thought I was FTM, not mtf and actually trying to be supportive. I was giving off very androgynous vibes early in transition most strangers truly couldn‚Äôt tell my assigned gender at birth as I have a naturally effeminate yet only slightly deeper than cis female voice. I just corrected them and told them my pronouns and suggested they ask first to avoid confusion and had zero problem. We can‚Äôt be mad at ignorant people, only the ones who go out of their way to keep others ignorant or insist on remaining so after being confronted with the truth. But like I said if it was really malicious then fuck him and I support u girl. Sometimes it‚Äôs just hard to tell I know cause I‚Äôve been in your spot plenty of times.
My respect i wish the Best for you ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm so sorry that happened to you! I'm actually a substitute myself, and dead naming a student is one of my worst fears. Some teachers are nice enough to provide a list of preferred names and pronouns in the notes they leave, but some don't, and the school only uses legal names on the rolecall sheet. I always tell students to correct me if I use a name they don't prefer, but I know that doesn't always make it easier. 

I obviously don't mean to defend your sub. It sounds like they were malicious and transphobic. Screw them, and you definitely should mention the incident to your regular teacher when they're back.
You should call transphobic teachers whatever you want and if you get in trouble just claim that your ‚Äòdeeply held religious convictions‚Äô demand you call them that.  They can‚Äôt ask you to define/defend your ‚Äòdeeply held religious convictions‚Äô:
Happened to me about an hour ago. Fucking sucked. Nobody in my class knew my deadname two hours ago and now they all do.
Report the sub. Please. Have them lose their teaching license. What they did is not ok.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre <deadname>, right?‚Äù
‚ÄúErr, no, I‚Äôm <realname>‚Äù
Devil's advocate: Is your deadname listed as your name in the school's roster? If she had a list of every student's name, and your deadname instead of your preferred name was on the list, then it's not necessarily the substitute's fault. Is there any way she could have known what your preferred name was?
[removed]
I would‚Äôve went nope never was. I don‚Äôt take your calling me by the wrong name lightly. so I‚Äôd probably have it out to make her day hell
Thank you so much for all the support <3 Schools over now so I'm just going to be lazy and have a mental health day now.
You don't deserve to go through any of this, And we're here for you. As for the people being twats in your DMs, They need to chill the hell out. Everyone has different experiences and values. Someone else's threshold being different doesn't give them a right to be mean to you for yours.

None of us know what anyone else is going through or why something hurts the way it does.
I am so sorry. Hopefully better days are ahead.
I‚Äôm sure that she just called out the register and that was the name she had been given for you, I highly doubt that she deliberately called you it. She is a substitute and so likely doesn‚Äôt know you or any of the other students.
Yeah this. I had to fill out some paperwork and such, but my school changed my name in their entire system. Teachers don't even get to know my deadname (unless they had me before I got it changed) and it's really helpful.
I think their gender looks something like this üñï and it should continue looking like this until they learn respect
Personally not a fan if this method because using pronouns/gendered language as a weapon isn't helping anyone and if anything can lead people to the idea of withholding gender recognition as a punishment.
I'm glad someone else thought of this. A substitute isn't going to know what everyone prefers to be called unless it's marked down. It's a very real possibility your name isn't mentioned in an obvious place (such as listed in the attendance sheet in place of your deadname). It's more likely that this sub had no way of knowing your name rather than it being full on malicious. 

It really sucks though, especially with the type of people you're classmates are.
Love this
Honestly, yea, same

Edit: Name checks out, lol
‚ÄùI use misgendering to destroy misgendering‚Äù
It also tells your trans friends that your respect of their gender identity is contingent upon them keeping you in their good graces."	x85kec	trans	1049	0.96	2022-09-07 13:46:27
i (22mtf) got de-homed by my ex (21f) for being trans	 i was with my ex for 4 years, lived with her for a year and a half, she moved in because her parents were mentally abusive to her so i didn‚Äôt charge rent for the first few months to give her time to settle in. she knew when she moved in that i was definitely not cis and was experimenting with my gender and was leaning toward trans and i was very communicative of this every step of the way and she told me at every step she loved me and supported me and would still have me no matter what, which made me feel secure in what we had. during 2021 i took time off work after saving up money to cover my half of rent for a while because my previous job had become the source of a lot of my (at the time poorly managed) anxiety, and when i took time off work we agreed i would take over the chores at home while she continued to work. my savings ran a little closer to comfort than i would‚Äôve liked, but i found a job around the time i ran dry on funds, so that meant i would need a month for her to cover rent and i‚Äôd pay her back like we agreed. i also came out to my mom around the same time, and shortly after my ex said we should part ways since she doesn‚Äôt want to be with a girl (it‚Äôs great she validated my identity but wtf) after telling me for so long she‚Äôd love me no matter what, and since i couldn‚Äôt pay rent for 1 month i needed to leave. our relationship had definitely run dry toward the end but we respected each other up til the very end and i spent as much time as i could making sure she had a relaxing home to come back to and it seemed like nothing i could do could please her anymore. i get people change (trust me i‚Äôm changing a lot) but how could someone be so cruel? i gave her a home to move into when her parents house felt like a warzone, and this is what i get? i‚Äôm not mad at her, just upset that i feel led on for so long. idk just venting here. i‚Äôve met someone knew but not having companionship during this tender point in my life sucks. has anyone else gone through this?	"...is your name on the rent contract? Kick her out. She can't do it to you. Kick her the fuck out.
Well my ex isn‚Äôt quite as much of a sociopath as yours but she totally kicked me out, forgetting the years i had paid for her rent and the 50k I sunk (directly and indirectly) into her Etsy business. Good luck.
I suspect there is someone else in the picture that you‚Äôre not aware of. I wouldn‚Äôt be too surprised if a dude moves in with her before too long.
Ughhh I‚Äôm so sorry your going through this. it‚Äôs seriously tough i have been in a very similar situation. around 5-6 years ago are situation was a little different from yours being I moved in with her and not her moving in with me but everything else same situation we switched who worked I worked then I stayed home and did chores while she went to work and I came out to her she was so supportive and loving but also said I can‚Äôt be with a girl what happened with us tho I ended up walking in on her having a threesome and that was the last straw for me it was coming tho are relationship like you said it went very dry she in the end was extreamly heartless to me took a lot of my childhood belongings scrapbooks things like that I made when I was a kid. I can tell you tho you don‚Äôt want any part of that it‚Äôs so stressful especially in the middle of a transition and honestly you just don‚Äôt deserve that trust me it gets much more toxic. I have personally just tryed to accept being alone for now until I reach were I want to be so I have full focus on doing the best for me! And oh god it‚Äôs been the best decision I feel like iv made so much progress after doing that. It may look bad atm and you may be going through it right now but pick yourself up do everything you can to get another job and get you another place to live and focus on yourself for awhile I promise things will get better just don‚Äôt loose hope in yourself!! I believe in you! And if you ever need anyone to talk too you can always message me iv been through 2 of these kinds of relationships so I Deffinitly understand how much it can hurt and how totally cruel it feels. Sorry my comment is so long I just saw your post and red it and it deff resonated with me since iv been through similar situations.
She used you for a place to stay until she found someone else she could use.
I'm sorry I'm missing something. It's your house. You're the one that entered into an agreement with the owner right? How does this work?
Keep fighting, you got this üëäüèº
So at a base level your ex is exhibiting some very selfish behavior. 
1. Like everyone else is saying, it's your house. Send her packing back to her parents. She used you for a home and when she felt like she hod the power in the relationship she kicked you out. If you want to take care of this in a non confrontational manner talk to your landlord and have them kick her out. And do your best to keep everything you ever got her. 
2. Toxic behavior can be remedied with therapy. You are going through a transitional time in your life and things will get back to normal. The relationship was strained but like any successful relationship between mtf and cis f they all said patience time and effort  was all they needed to make things work and nobody had to get hurt. Just like ANY other relationship. 
3. She's definitely going through things as well and she's taking it out on you. This easily stemming from her family history. Being said warzone, she doesn't have healthy examples of adults to take experience from to properly address situations in her life and that means she will always make it someone else's problem until she gets therapy. 

With all this being said I want you to know that you are a young lady and you don't need to worry about the past anymore. You have a GIGANTIC wide open future waiting for you. Take care of yourself and don't focus too hard on those bitter sweet footnotes in your life that she has left you with. There are too many ways available to you for you to have a happy life beyond taking care of a parasitic partner in your past.
If your name is on the rent contract, she can't kick you out. 

If her name is also on the rent contract, then she can remain (as can you) until the lease ends. 

If her name is NOT on the rental contract, she's a subtenant under you and you can give her 30 days' notice (in most parts of the US, at least) and SHE has to move out. If she doesn't leave at the end of 30 days, you can call the police on her on day 31 and have them remove her. You technically could call now, but she MIIIIIIGHT be able to take you to court for that - not worth the risk (unless she's been physically violent - including throwing or breaking things - or shouted at you, in which case she can be removed even if her name is also on the lease).

In terms of her changing the locks, call your landlord and say that somebody has changed your locks and you need to be let in; if your landlord does not have a copy of the new keys, they can call the police, or you can also call the police and tell them your name is on the lease and someone has changed the locks without your permission.
Honestly screw her. You let her in, paid for her rent, saved her from abusive parents and she kicks YOU out ? If i were you i'd stay and kick her out of the house, it's alright if she doesn't feel comfortable being with a woman but after 4 years of telling you she loves you ? And all of a sudden this happens ? She should go back to her parents tbh
Call the police and have them kick her out! You have every right to your home.
Don't get trolled by this post :)
it was, and i really probably should‚Äôve explored my
options, i just didn‚Äôt want a fight as much as it hurt me to have to leave. she even changed the locks before i got my name off the contract and my stuff out which if i were the kinda person i could‚Äôve taken it to court but again i just didn‚Äôt want it to hurt any more than it did
""forgetting""
more like she asked me to leave but there wasn‚Äôt going to be an option for me to stay because she played on my sympathy and i didn‚Äôt want her to go back to her parents. i shoulda worded all of this better it happened 2 months ago and i‚Äôm living with friends now, just looking for emotional support rather than legal, shit just hurts
She‚Äôs a thief. Fight back!
Honey, your ex lied to you then kicked you out of your own home. You *should* be angry. You *should* exert your rights *to your own home*. 

It sounds like you are internalizing all this as equally your fault. It isn't.
ü•≤ omg babe I'm so sorry. I do the same thing. 

I don't feel like typing it all out rn but 4 years ago I moved in with a family that kicked me out in the middle if the night with no warning and when I showed up with police in the morning all my belongings and hard drives I've ever owned disappeared into thin air. The court system turned against me. She began cyber stalking me and harassing me. Eventually I had to move out of town for a while just to beable to breathe.

 But I basically just shut down and couldn't defend myself throughout the whole process... if I didn't have my partner helping me that ordeal would've been it üò∞ 

Thank God I have people that care about me cause my family doesn't even care that happened.
I'm sorry. I hope youbhave somewhere to stay. She deserves to be homeless.
I think it's amazing how nice you are, but you're being too nice.

It hurts when you feel like you were nicer to your partner than they were to you, but I was god awful at setting boundaries and being mad when I should have been and that kept me hurt even longer. If you're anything like me, it almost feels wrong to stand up for myself but I try to do it anyways because not standing up for yourself is precisely why they're using you and not someone else in the first place. If it's already been two months and you let it all slide, don't beat yourself up, I did exactly that before too but I still eventually learned to just consider a lesson and the pain eventually subsides.

I hope things are better for you now than when it all happened owo!!!
This!!! You really need to do something. Breaking up with you because of your gender is one thing but causing you homelessness and denying you access to your property out of spite is another thing entirely. Please take this further. What she did is wrong.
Nobody deserves to be homeless
No one deserves to be homeless. Don't say that.
You are correct, I'm going through shit myself and I'm projecting
I disagree.  I have an asshole squatter living in a house I own for the past year and he definitely deserves to be homeless.
That is okay, don't worry.
We all go through things, I really hope you feel better soon and that everything will work out.

You got this!
Fuck I have this problem so bad aswell
Once again no. They do not.

I work with the vulnerable weekly. You would be amazed how many have been convinced that they ""deserve"" to be outside in the cold. Please don't have a hardened heart towards others.

UPDATE: ‚ÄúI have Satan controlling me‚Äù *eyeroll*	"According to my parents, someone has been in my ear for a while now. ‚ÄúThe world‚Äù has been in my ear. Satan has been controlling me and is currently controlling me‚Ä¶  

Conversion therapy isn‚Äôt a thing; what it is really called is ‚Äúconversion‚Äù, as in conversion with Christ. What I need is Christ. 

We are having another ‚Äúconversation‚Äù tonight. We aren‚Äôt mad at you‚Ä¶ We just want to talk. We just want to save our ‚Äúson‚Äù. 

Our pastor already told you the choice that you *need* to make. (I‚Äôm aware of that)

Would you rather hate yourself and hate your life, over a choice that you made? You won‚Äôt be happy being that way. You‚Äôll lose all of your friends, family, and you won‚Äôt have any relationship with a girl‚Ä¶

They are probably praying right now. 

I had to physically walk away from the conversation that my mom wanted to have with me. I was late for class too‚Ä¶"	"Who me? Yeah me and satan go way back he's actually a really nice guy. Helped me change a flat on the m40 and said if I ever need help just dial the satan services hotline and he'd take over my body to cause extremely evil small nuisances to Christian people before changing my tyre for me as payment. Can do it over the net now thanks to devil speak 2.0. Thanks satan :D
This thinking is what makes me hate religion so much. Stay strong.
Pls be safe home girl.
I wanna hug you
Don‚Äôt let them decide who you are, stay strong sister
Lucifer says love yourself for who you are, go girl!
It's me, satan, the person that controls you.

I'm out of milk.  Remember our contract.  I control you, so pick some up.  

Also, a dozen eggs and a frozen pizza (not digiorno, they're owned by nestle).

^(jokes aside that's horrible and I hate that for you, and I legitimately hope things improve)
I feel you on this... My family has all but disowned me at this point. They don't even know I'm trans yet... But honestly, I'll say from my personal experience, cutting ties with them and going ""no contact"" was one of the best things I could have done.
According to the Bible itself. Jesus loves everyone. It doesn‚Äôt even make sense to their own religion to hate us.
My conversion therapy went so bad that I ended up converting the priest to be on my side
Coming from a religious family this is my worst nightmare if i ever come out to them. I'm still strong in my religion and know that God loves me. But I know so many people have awful experiences with it and it makes them turn away. I hope to one day be the religious support that religious LGBT people need. Please stay strong and hang in, we've all got you back here <3

The fact that they already admitted you wouldn't have a family if you transitioned probably means you should get out of there and cut them off. The friends and shit thing is them trying to further a point obviously and isn't true, but admitting they wouldn't be there for you is basically what they were saying with the whole family thing.

You can find family anywhere else love. Just get somewhere safe please? Start a plan to cutting them off. Like moving or other stuff. Maybe you can go back and see them after you cut them off for a few years but right now you just gotta worry about you.
Christians make Satan sound pretty cool.

I‚Äôm sorry you are going through this. Just remember it will get better. You have a chosen family our here waiting for you.
Every time i read this kinda stuff i think ""no way it gets worse""... if i had a dime for every time i was wrong lmaoo
I tried all of that. For decades, I went through therapists, antidepressants, and a whole lot of religion, from Catholic all the way to speaking in tongues Pentacostal. I tried being a total Jesus freak, I tried to pray it away. It doesn't work.
Tell them that using God's name as reason to hurt someone even if the intention is pure is still a cardinal sin because they misused God's name and caused pain with it. This use to be considered blasphemy
Sounds like my mom. I pretty much have cut off contact with her and ignore her pitiful texts. But I‚Äôm also turning 30 next month and just started transitioning last April. So I‚Äôm where I can cut her out of my life.
It's not religion,  it's people misinterpreting religion. I mean,  I'm quite religious but I'm transitioning and it's nobody's business
Ps I'm not  Religious in the slightest but I have eyes in my head and common sense in my brain
every time i hear the phrase ‚Äúsatan controlling me‚Äù i now hear dr doofenshmirtz ‚Äúi got a platypus controlling me!‚Äù song
Be extremely nice to them, make some cookies or something and tell them satan is controlling me to do these things.

In all seriousness, don't play into their narrative, you have your views, opinions and beliefs. If you don't believe in the whole the world vs gods chosen tell them that you don't hold those beliefs. You have your reasons to not hold the same beliefs as them, let them know those.

 At the end of the day what they are saying are just opinions and interpretations of things, this is your life, not theirs. Wish you the best.
Gross. I'm so sorry. Sounds both depressing and obnoxious to deal with.

(And this is also why I waited to move out before I came out ~~because I'm a coward~~)
Religious zealots project so hard
I‚Äôm a trans girl and I‚Äôm very close to God. Just cuz someone is transgender does not mean they don‚Äôt have a relationship with God. ANYONE can be close to God.
My parents are similar, but don‚Äôt do conversions

But that‚Äôs probably because they don‚Äôt know anything about me being trans
Look, don't blame the Devil for a job humans are willing to do.
Same thing happens to me thing is god wants us to be happy and theres no mention of transgender in the bible
I'm so sorry you deal with those...people. I can't really call them parents because they don't fit the standard, and honestly...I'm pretty sure satan would be...nicer than them.
I wish Satan would whisper in my ear. I've been trying to get a hold of that fuck for years
oh lovely, my grandmother also thinks I've a devil in me because of my gender; wanna be satan buddies and burn down a church together while drenched in the blood of goats?
Oh! Satan ? He's a good guy really,  people should always listen to him.  
He's the most accepting being I know,  unlike Jesus.
Report them for child abuse
If you're looking for resources, /r/TransChristianity has a lot of links.

There's also Austen Hartke (AustenLionheart) a transgender man with a Masters in Biblical Studies who has a 'Transgender and Christian' YouTube series.

The only thing I would warn you about if you choose this path, is that not everyone is willing to change their beliefs even when presented with new evidence. The real bias most evangelicals have is ""it's not like me, so it's bad"" and it takes a long time for those thoughts to change.

I wish you luck. Be strong but be safe.
Don't worry, it's a compliment.

Seriously, just look at the bible, Satan is the good guy. Freedom of thought and advocacy for knowledge/logic, vs God constantly murdering everyone who loves and worships him for the lulz. Seems pretty clear cut to me.

Go join the Satanic temple and show them your membership card, it'll be great.
I don‚Äôt know how old you are, so that dictates your responses. 

Theology is a slippery eel. Every argument can be countered. You can tell them, ‚ÄúBe careful about scribing to the Devil what is God‚Äôs work. God made me this way. God made me trans. Trans people are part of God‚Äôs creation, too. There‚Äôs plenty of supporting evidence. 

Jesus said not to hurt children. He said it would be better if a stone be hung around a person‚Äôs neck and they be thrown into the sea if they hurt someone like me. You‚Äôre hurting me. 

Jesus also said our only real job in life is to be good to ‚Äòthe least of these.‚Äô He said when you‚Äôre cruel to ‚Äòthe least of these,‚Äô you‚Äôre being cruel to Him. Trans people are the least of any group on earth. Stop being cruel to me. Stop being cruel to Jesus.‚Äù

I'd repeat ""Hail Satan"" out loud until he shut up and let me go
Best of luck with everything. I had to wait until I was out of the house to do anything. Not for lack of trying.

Stay safe and we're all here if you need us.
Don't let them browbeat you and bible-thump you back into not being yourself. Stay strong. Much love sis. ü´Ç
So you have a made up entity whispering things in your ear, the cure is to trust and give yourselves to another mythological and made up character who too was not only tempted by satan but was crucified in space by him and his demons in early judeo Christian theology? Its sad when Christians dont know their texts or lore yet try to judge.
Welcome to the land of Nod.  Aside from that one bald guy constantly ranting about GDI, it's pretty nice here.

Certifiably antique referential humor aside, it's awfully presumptive of them to want you to turn your back on what God made you to be, in order to be what they want you to be.  If ""God made you just the way you are"", then what God made you is trans, and those self-righteous false prophets need to stop interfering with God's will for you.

(If it's not patently obvious, I absolutely despise the ""Religion means I'm not an asshole because my assholery has divine justification"" mindset...)

How long until you can get out?  If it's reasonably short term I'm half tempted to suggest malicious compliance...revel in the joy of beating them at their own game by going stealth at home (and only at home); having your boobs but wearing a binder \[you'll still know they're there!\], having ""Girl-out Bags"" (stealing the survivalist's ""bug-out bag"" concept) stashed in key places so you can wear a skirt as underwear and then take your pants off when you get to safer spaces, etc.
IDK why people are so down on Satan. Dude brings enlightenment and shows that we don't have to blindly submit to the autocratic terror of a supposedly omnipotent deity. He's more of a friend to us than SkyDaddy ever was.
As a trans Satanist witch I don't see the problem?
Soooooo glad you gave yourself permission to walk away from that TOXIC HATEFUL SHIT!!
God I feel this, although they haven‚Äôt gone to drastic measures to convince me that I‚Äôm not trans yet. They almost did by financially cutting me off, but thankfully a little bit of lying helped avoid that. I haven‚Äôt been able to be honest with my parents for years because of their constant privacy intrusions and lack of care for me and my emotional well being.

Oof. I'm moving out the day after tomorrow, and this weekend my mom looked at my chest and connected the dots of what's going on with me. I'm afraid this is about to happen to me and I'm still under their roof for now, they still could make my life miserable if they want to, I need my father to drive me to the city I'm moving to. It's a 2 hour journey and I gotta take some furniture with me cause I would rather not sleep on the ground and I'm broke. Fuck I hate christianity with all my heart (not christ though, dude was cool)
It's funny, Satanists don't even believe in a Satan. Well, at least not The Satanic Temple. And they'd support you.
This sort of shit is why I am a Satanist.
Satan has a lot of power. If he is controling you, it is without your consent and he owes you. Get something good out of this like boobs. 

When your parents get old you get to choose where to put them. Use your imagination. Let them know what you came up with. These people are crazy.
Forsake your god, worship Baphomet, party with queers, be happy
Christian parents are delusional wack jobs who don't know anything about the real world. I'm hoping for you OP.
Sending big loves and gentle protective hugs
Also, I just want to add (even if you guys don‚Äôt believe) that I‚Äôm a Pagan that works with Lucifer as my main deity & he has helped me a buttload figure out who I am to be happy with myself. So even if they say that to you - Lucifer literally represents freedom & sticking up for yourself üñ§ 

I‚Äôll be thinking of you. Christians have ruined a lot in terms of the conditioning of this world.
Sending my support, I know too many people who go through similar things. This is not acceptable; this is abuse.
Ride the storm out. start a scrapbook of clothes you want to buy.
Imaginary friends is one thing, but imaginary enemies?

Hard to take religion seriously.
Ask them this""why is your god so obsessed with hating others""

Or ""Satan seems like a stand up dude because he accepts everyone, why would I wanna be like you when all you do is hate my existence""

They could‚Ä¶ Our pastor just preached a series on heaven, hell, angels and demons.
On a serious note though because it does sound it. I had to go along with whatever my parents said until I could get free, fighting it only made them double down and things would get worse. As bad as it felt I had to play their game for many years, and resist their attempts to change me into them. It was worth it for me but its been a very rough ride so I don't blame anyone for struggling. Wishing you some good luck
Understandable. My two most hated words are ""What if"".
Here's the argument you need

So, gender is an immutable (meaning unable to be controlled) part of the psyche. The psyche is one half of the mind, the other half being the intellect. By rejecting your body in favor of your psyche, better known as your soul (œàœÖœáŒ∑) you are turning inward away from the world and becoming more spiritual. Why are they rejecting who God made you to be in favor of your worldly body?
It is so tragic these people hate others for living in reality without them
I wish your parents were less cringe. Stay strong
Woot!  As someone studying anatomy right now myself that‚Äôs an impressive score!  You go girl!!!
Congrats on your progress and your anatomy score! :)

You deserve every victory and happy moment
i‚Äôm sending virtual hugs <3. i‚Äôm proud of you and i‚Äôm very sorry you are going through this
[removed]
Fair. I sometimes forget that I'm one of the older people here. I do hope things get better for you. But, if they don't, once you're old enough unfortunately moving out and going ""no contact"" might be your best option
I‚Äôve been going through this for the last 5 years. I‚Äôve known I was trans for 7 years now. I‚Äôm 22.
Mhmm
What if you hate other words too?
My point exactly, but my pastor denied that.
Thank you.
Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Go fuck yourself bot
Dammit bot, I did upvote!
Become independent asap, maybe you could find a group and get a roommate who's trans (maybe a couple) so you can move out and into a space you know will be safe. Right now housings so hard to come by, but if you've got a group of three going in and you make enough then housings actually ""affordable"" if you have a relative who's on your side maybe see if you could go there for now. Your an adult, and your parents can't make you do anything no matter what they say. Don't give them what they want, you deserve to be happy.
Oh I do.  Those are just my most hated.
Yeah well your pastor is full of bull then and is a wolf in sheep's clothing. I'm a theology student and the Bible is really clear here, in favor of the right to transition
<3
He tried to share scripture about being homosexual, but that's not being trans...
And on the note about sexuality, the bible isn't actually against homosexuality, but this is a much more grey area and frankly not worth your time until after you win the battle on gender
Exactly, if you talk to him about it again point out that this isn't about sexuality
If you want to try debating him using scriptures, in r/TransChristianity you can find many useful pro-trans passages, especially in comments
There's literally nothing about lesbians in the old testament because women touching each other didn't matter. Sex outside of marriage was property crime. You were devaluing another man's property, be that his wife or his daughter who he could sell at a bride price. Since women can't get women pregnant it's a non issue. It's the same reason there's no specific statute against a father abusing his daughter. She was his property so if he devalued her there was no one to claim restitution from. God and Sex by Michael Coogan is very interesting on this topic.

The one scripture in deuteronomy about cross dressing I've seen interpreted as a law against men trying to get out of military service or other conscription duties by pretending to be a woman, rather than anything to do with homosexuality. Besides it only mentions wearing clothes, nothing sexual.

Finally Jesus annulled the law or fulfilled it or however you want to put it and said love God and love your neighbor. He repeatedly pointed out that alleviating human suffering was more important than following the law, like healing on the sabbath which would have been a capitol crime. If you're in pain physically or emotionally that should supersede any potential conflicts with the Bible, and there isn't even any clear scriptures against being trans.
On the further on this last one, not only is there not any clear scripture against but there is clear scripture in favor of transitioning if you are trans
Adding on to this, the oft-cited bit about male homosexuality?  Intentionally mistranslated, it was originally a piece about pedophilia...which makes you wonder who wanted that change because the why should be pretty obvious...
Not to be rude, but can you please either send the verses to me, or explain how it's clear?
To add to your addition... üòÇ The verses from Paul about not submitting or making others submit to you, that was about the Roman client/patron relationship. This dynamic was an underpinning to much of how Rome ran, but at this level it was basically the prison bitch situation. If you couldn't pay your dues or something along those lines you'd be humiliated by your patron, who would fuck you to show whose boss. Paul was saying don't humiliate your fellow Christians because they're all supposed to be equal. 

Romans didn't have a concept of homosexuality. It was tops and bottoms. If you were receiving you were lower in status. Women could be dominant to men if they were on top, for instance. It wasnt about gender but who was the higher status. If you were a man and the one giving no one would blink an eye. 

It's not really to do with the sex, it's to do with the power dynamic and abuse.
Ive heard that the homosexuality verses were to keep guys banging women for procreation. Back in the day they were tribal and numbers was a real thing. Personally, I think if it were a real problem with spirituality, they would talk a whole lot more about it.
same here
R\*pe as punishment, that's...not beyond horrific or anything. ü§Æ  

Though I'm a dirty-minded fool giggling at the mental image of some poor scribe taking notes as Paul is ranting about ""Thou shalt not do anything that shalt require a safeword"" (even funnier if it was shortly after he got chewed out for being lousy at aftercare...) and trying to write it down in a way that's tactful.

Makes me think of a lot of the ""Founders' Intent"" stuff in the US, and all the romanticized out-of-context stuff surrounding it.  Their intent was ""We don't like this stuff about the British laws we lived under until recently"" mixed with ""Uhh, maybe we should protect this shit we did to forment revolution so that the next generation doesn't try us for formenting a revolution...""
I have no doubts that's the origin of the whole ""no wasted seed"" thing Judaism has going on...and similarly, that a lot of the rules of Kosher food have origins in bronze-age food safety; the meat and dairy sharing a plate thing is cross-contamination 101, especially given it'd be several centuries before pasteurization became a thing."	t0ddc8	trans	989	0.99	2022-02-24 15:14:13
Why do uneducated cis people come here so much?	"Im on mobile so format might be weird.

Okay but seriously, I understand and I'm glad that cis people come here to educate themselves on trans issues and how it's like to be trans, but a good number of them are very rude and entitled to our education, patience, and politeness.

You come into our space, ask invasive and basic questions that could easily be answered through google, and then get mad at us for not answering you in such a specific way so YOU don't feel threatened by us? What?? 

We're people, not personal educators to walk you through basic knowledge that couldve easily been done yourself. If you want to get detailed education you may as well pay us, like you would any other teacher. 

Sorry for the rant, it's just upsetting to see it so much. Does anyone else get frustrated by this, online  & in real life?"	"Some that come to attack: They have swallowed the bait from conservatives etc. That we trans are ""sick"" and so on. And some got a shitty life. So they find an ""enemy"". That we are marked as now. 

Some come with questions that are masked behind a level of being slightly transphobic. Comes in with statements that starting to enter the realm with that, but not quite. Or just purley uneducated. I've seen it more to the right then left. But, some seem just unaware of things regardless where they stand.

I try to think beyond that. I answer for myself, and others. I don't explain for them. I explain for others that might be trans that might read it. To see that we're not sick. We're not ""seeking attention"". Etc. We just want to be.
It genuinely seems that a lot of those people just do it as a way to actively harass and argue with trans people too, as if this is a political debate forum or something. It's gross.
they‚Äôre obsessed with us
Yeah especially when r/asktransgender exists for the specific purpose of answering cis people's questions. This subreddit is supposed to be a safe space for us to talk about things that are important to us, not answer their questions
I‚Äôm a cis person and I have strictly only commented positive things saying how awesome the OP looks, uplifting comments, etc. mostly I comment on pictures saying how great everyone looks. I can‚Äôt imagine someone walking into your space to be ignorant and I‚Äôm so sorry people like that exist. I simply joined because of my love for your community, and my love for all of you. But HONESTLY if I am invading anyone‚Äôs space, please let me know and I will kindly leave, as this is not my space it‚Äôs yours and entirely yours!! Thank you everyone üíû
Not only that but many of them also ask very basic questions that have already been answered here countless times, when they could just scroll through the sub for 5 minutes and find all the answers. It looks like they seriously think it‚Äôs our duty to educate them as if it were something we owe them. I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm happy to answer questions and educate people with good intentions who genuinelly want to learn, but I‚Äôve lost count of how many times I‚Äôve explained how the fucking trans umbrella works and how non binary people can also be trans, when you can literally find the damn drawing everywhere on google. Or all the times I‚Äôve had to explain to some cishet dude that not wanting to date a trans woman  just because she‚Äôs trans isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúpreference‚Äù.
I consider myself to be you garden variety cis-het guy.  I come here mainly as a father of a trans kid (f2m).  I always strive to be the best father to him I can be, and this seemed like the best place to go to learn and potentially get advice.  I also felt like I could perhaps provide the perspective of a parent when appropriate.  

There are just some questions that are uncomfortable and I'm in a position where I'm trying to guide him through things that I will never fully understand.
I haven't asked any questions here but I am a cis woman and I'm here because my partner is mtf, and I want to educate myself so that I can support her and try to get some understanding of what she's going through.
This! Especially, people dogwhistle with these questions all the time. We dont owe anyone kindness or education.
I will only say here that sometimes people who come with questions, claiming to be cis, are eggs who are afraid to crack and hoping to find something warm and inviting for them to fall into. Most of us who transition are doing so with full knowledge that they're going to give up whatever they have and be left with nothing. Their relationships and lives as they know it will be severed, and they need a soft landing space.

Yelling, ""It's not my job to teach you,"" is abrasive and harmful to these new people in the community. Either don't answer the question, or have a little grace. You don't know what someone else might be going through.

In the case of thinly-veiled transphobic questions and people with histories on Reddit of stirring up shit? Fuck those guys. They are relatively easy to spot.
I think a lot of people think that if we expect fair treatment from others that we should literally jump at any opportunity to educate people without considering our lived experience which is full of people asking dumb/annoying questions.
Cis person here. I came to watch/learn - sometimes clarify things i dont understand. My daughter is trans, and early on i put my foot it in with some basic shitty joke/culture thing - i want to do better.  


I rarely ask things so much other than clarification - a lot of it is just trying to understand what she  deals with, has to deal with, future, and generally so i can make sure my daughter has her best life.  


Tbh i have found this sub mostly super supportive, amazing people, and its made me realize how toxic every day  people can be that i never noticed, so i strive to be nicer , less judgemental
Totally.
I thought it was pretty normal for them to invade our privacy?
I don't get mad about it, tbh.  there's so much misinformation i'm just glad to theoretically be able to change someone's mind.  You get rude and people will react emotionally in the wrong way.  It sucks to have to field constant room 101 level questions but that's how it is when you're a minority who had just entered the public conversation in a big way for the first time.
Sometimes someone is just curious in order to figure out what box to put people in, not even realizing that people don‚Äôt need to fit into boxes at all. I don‚Äôt like it when I take the time to answer some questions and then they offer their opinion on me, my presentation, and their surprise at finding me to be just like almost every other person. Like they‚Äôll say things that are meant to be compliments- for example 

1 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a woman- I never expected a transgender person to actually make me think that so deeply‚Äù like ew- don‚Äôt validate me at the expense of my entire community, just tell me I‚Äôm beautiful or whatever and move on.

2 ‚ÄúYou give such lesbian vibes- but not in a trans way. Like in a cis woman type of way‚Äù (for context I‚Äôm not lesbian- I‚Äôm pansexual and it‚Äôs irritating feedback I didn‚Äôt ask for) don‚Äôt make comments on peoples sexuality based on their presentation. Anyone, and I mean ANYONE can be attracted to anyone. Im not even butch or anything.. could maybe be my voice being a bit lower than a cis woman‚Äôs but it‚Äôs still very femme after voice training.
talking gender with cis people is the worst
Honestly, while some of these people can be problematic, others are asking genuine questions, and I‚Äôd rather they trust us for those answers than a google search or some random Karen on Facebook.  Getting information from the right sources is a lot rarer these days than it should be, and I actually appreciate it.

As a semi uneducated, kinda cis person, I come here and I try to be as respectful as I can. I come here because I find it's easier to relate and hear from personal experiences, as that's usually better explained then Google searches. I deeply apologize for those who do come here and be rude.
it‚Äôs better to get info straight from the people who are knowledgeable and experienced than to sort through the conflicting info on google.
Tbh, if it wasnt for their attitudes, im glad that they purposely come to a trans community for their questions. Theres a lot of right wing media or terf ideology sites that counts on uneducated cis people just using google, so they can plant harmful rhetoric into the minds of people who dont know how to spot the dogwhistles (which turns out to be everyone who doesnt need to think about how to spot them).

I do wish they would use the subreddits search bar, but unless theyre being unnecessarily defensive i dont think we should admonish cis people for coming to us to speak about ourselves.
The worst for me is the cis people that come in here to get congratulated on being a ‚Äúgood‚Äù cis person and collecting internet woke points. Like why dont you take that energy and stand up to your transphobic family and friends or better yet, help us fight back against the genocide that is currently happening to trans people? 

We‚Äôll pat you on the back when you start becoming actual allies helping us fight for our rights, not just ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù.
Baffled by how many cis people cone here and ask ""is this thing that I did transphobic?"" and then get angry when the answer is ""yes"".
I know what you mean but our 'world' is complicated and in my opinion has far too many acronyms to try and pigeon hole   people who I think would probably be better not being pigeon holed in the first place. 

I can completely get people's confusion especially given that you can read 10 articles about trans and non binary people and get 10 different answers!!

That is not an excuse for being rude. Still, a lack of information makes it a lot easier to be rude so it may not always be intentional.
Why don't we just ban cis people from this sub? It's literally a space for trans people and I've seen its quite apparent that many cis people are just gonna be at best a nuisance to our community and at worst they will keep doing bigoted shit like this. 
I know this is controversial and such but it confuses me, black Twitter has a similar rule why don't we just do it here aswell? This isn't an ask reddit, there is literally r/askatransgender or smth like that where they can post their questions.

This isn't to say #allcisarebad just that trans people need their own space without cis people doing this shit, least we can have is a singular sub.
Idk my take on it is, if they are rude any very pushy, or overly invasive with questions. Then yes f them! If they are genuinely trying to educate themselves, or asking advice. I‚Äôm more than happy to answer all kinds of questions. I feel like the more we educate, the more education about us will be spread. Instead of bs lies.
I feel this way too
I see you‚Äôre issues and I kinda get it, but I‚Äôd rather have people ask and learn than not ask and make someone feel bad later on.
Yes. I get so pissed all the fucking time. They act like bc we‚Äôre trans we have to explain every aspect of our identity to whoever may be curious. My mom does this shit. ‚ÄúWell if you‚Äôd just explain it and talk to our family they might understand better!‚Äù No mom. If they actually gave a damn behind the questions they‚Äôre asking they‚Äôd go out on their own to learn. They wouldn‚Äôt wait for me to sit them down and explain it. They would educate them self and at least try to get a basic understanding of correct vs insensitive. Good vs bad. What the basic knowledge that they can gather on their own and what‚Äôs better to ask questions about to actual people. (This applies to every cis person btw not just my family)
If they cared, they‚Äôd research and get basic knowledge at the minimum. They can spend time in trans groups on the internet BUT STAY QUIET (key: QUIET) and just listen and understand.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my job to educate the entire university‚Äù was my slogan.
I'm cis. But both of my kids are not. So that's why I'm here.
Thank u for this
I‚Äôd much rather online than in person I tend to deal with this a lot more in person üôÑ but yeah they shouldn‚Äôt be so rude online either
To all the cis women in the room, please stop asking if we've had ""THAT"" bottom surgery!

Personally, I've had the orchiectomy but not the vaginoplasty.  My doctor's office says the vaginoplasty is now having bad complications and I should wait..  

THERE is your answer!  

Now, i can just say ""find my Reddit post on the subject"" instead of feeling pressured to answer.

Otherwise, why does it matter???  I'm into my legal husband who has all the equipment.  

I don't use my one remaining part sexually. 

It's simply a garden hose.
Because they want to prove themselves right for the sake of their own sanity so they can feel safe in justifying their unwant to change
I was watching a DW documentary on people who protest in front of Planned Parenthood every day. And ALL were saying how this is their godlly duty ‚Äòto save us‚Äô. Yeah sure online a lot of trolls/hate speach transphobes but I am sure that their drive is very similar. They ‚Äòhave to do it‚Äô because ‚Äòits the protection from hell‚Äô or some such bs‚Ä¶ anyway have a pleasent day everybody and remember things are getting better üíõüíú
We have to do our best to educate the inquisitive and have a tough skin to the bigots
There's lots that lurk here just to insult us xD funny how we are trying to just live life and they who should be the ones set for life is just a reddit lurker.
Lol this is soooo funny, I‚Äôm a black man. Now y‚Äôall have a small hint of what we go through!
I think the real question that need be asked is: accountability, traceability, sustainability. Where can these qualities be found and cultivated? Once the demeanor changes and faculties are correctly reigned in, it becomes a matter of basic transformative principles as well as the ability to possess discretion at an absolute maximum. It cannot be turned or manipulated. We must all live our truth. From fanaticism comes instability and we all know that leads to malfunction of the propriety vantage point from which we operate.
I hate it so much when people mask their actual beliefs behind seemingly ignorant yet blissful questions. It makes you think you're safe, but as SOON as you speak in a tone that threatens their power dynamic, their true feelings come out.
This: when I ‚Äúargue‚Äù with people on here, it‚Äôs not to change the other persons mind, it‚Äôs to help the readers.
Okay, yes, I completely agree/understand, but like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trans, I‚Äôm from upstate NY (very conservative), my parents are EXTREMELY conservative, and I never met a homophobic/transphobic person or heard a slur until I moved to a liberal state. It‚Äôs ridiculous to me that people just assume all conservatives are transphobic or homophobic. We‚Äôre not. (Sorry, nothing against you or anything, just had to put this out there)
I didn't think about that...It really opens your eyes on how we're seen as a policial dilemma, not a group of people that breathe and think.
I blocked a woman once because she thought that just because I am a trans woman, I was looking for a bdsm relationship. Why are we seen as fetishes?
Hot take we should just ban cis people off this sub, or atleast make entry into it harder.
Damn, I literally just posted something and then this showed at the top of the page. I apologize, I didn‚Äôt know that sub existed.
I think this is exactly the way to approach this space as a cis person! You are here to appreciate, uplift, and probably also learn by listening. This doesn‚Äôt feel intrusive at all, at least to me. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I appreciate when a cis person is like you. You‚Äôre more than welcome here.
You are truly a kind soul and the world needs more people like you <3
You are fine no worries ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yeah- more of these people please! I‚Äôm not opposed at all to kind people who enter trans safe spaces. Nobody is perfect but you‚Äôre perfectly welcome here if you are respectful and kind- in other words don‚Äôt go! Pull up a chair and get comfy üòä
U are the kind of cis people we need xD life is overwhelming enough and some of them come here without sincerest interest in being an ally. Some are lurking here just to drop us dms of highly sexual or provocative things to insult us.

For me, I have steeled myself very well against these people but not everyone here is ready to deal with it. Sometimes we generalise over periods of insults but I'm sure most of us know a good ally when we see one. And you are exactly that and never a target of our exasperated generalization.
Don't get me started on genitalia preferences and how problematic they can be. It's so annoying
As the son of a father who will never love me in this manner, I'm glad people like you exist. This post is more for a very specific type of cis person, who come here with ignorance and entitlement, while expecting nothing but grace in return. Folks like you and other cis people are more than welcome here otherwise :]
I‚Äôm glad to see that you support your son. I wish more family was as supportive as you
This post is more of a specific type of cis person, so don't worry. I'm not saying cis people aren't welcome, I'm just frustrated at how entitled some cis people can be when in this sub. You and your partner are welcome here!
This part. We see white people believe themselves entitled to endless explanations of Black experiences with no mindfulness of their trauma. We see abled people demanding explanation from the disability community for literally their very existence. Pick a marginalized identity and you will find its counterpart endlessly making it justify itself. It's idiotic and infuriating, and any one of us is perfectly reasonable to be fed up with it.
""Answer my question... no, not like that!""
I agree to what you say. I think the reason why it's not a rule, though, is because in doing so it can unintentionally harm trans people, because then we'll have to ""prove"" our transness in some way, which feels icky, and it also prevents questioning people from being involved. Especially questioning people who end off as cis.
dang, it makes me sad that people feel this way, but I understand it, most cis people are extremely rude and mostly just wanna cause trouble because they're bored and hateful.

I just wanna say that I'm cis too but I like being here because I really enjoy the culture, and I learned a lot about how to be kinder to trans people and understand them. I know this subreddit isn't for cis people, but still, it has helped me grow as a cis person and accept trans people.

Which is a good thing right? Because now maybe more cis people will be fighting for your rights alongside you...

I just love how accepting of each other people are here, this sub is kind of a break from the harsh world that wants to put everyone in a box and try to stop you from existing if you're in the ""wrong"" box
I just don't think this specific sub is very appropriate for that, yknow? This sub is supposed to be a safe network and community by trans people and for trans people, not a place cis people go to for their questions, well-meaning or not. They have r/asktransgender for that.
Yeah. Been there. Done that. I try to stay away from calling them names and stuff.

But, I have asked them if they are ok when their arguments resembles something a 5 yr old high on sugar would come up with.

I try to be kind, but take no shit.
The tricky part is that a lot of cis people (and this goes with all privileges really) don't understand that because we live in a transphobic society that they are going to have absorbed transphobic attitudes and ideas even if they think of themselves as decent or polite. It's almost like being a sleeper cell. But anyway, when you challenge them on that they take it as a challenge to their ideas of themselves as decent people so they will get extreme and angry often. In the wider arena of progressivism there is not enough discussion about implicit biases and subconscious beliefs and how they can be more damaging than someone openly bigoted because at least with them you'll see the attacks coming. Again, the sleeper cell metaphor applies because you may find the ally beside you ready to betray you at the slightest jostle of their self esteem it entitlement. It's not fair that we have to be, or at least are certainly expected to be, better than them, infinitely patient, empathetic and magnanimous despite being the ones hurting. Otherwise we-always assumed to be representatives of the overall group-make our group look bad by being anything less than perfect in these exchanges. Unfortunately I don't think there's any real solution in the practical sense. I think fielding these questions online is a way bigger issue than in day to day living personally so maybe it would be helpful to have a list of links ready to spam at the more brazenly entitled askers.
There's a term for this, it's called ""Just Asking Questions"" or more specifically, [sealioning](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions#Sealioning). Engaging with those sorts of people takes practice. You can't let them control the topic or veer into other questions. You have to be firm and set boundaries and be clear that you're not taking their shit while also being respectful and patient (to a point). It's absolutely not something that should be expected of every member of a minority group, though. It's frustrating and requires emotional stamina that a lot of people just don't have.
I had exactly that happen to me one time in a conversation about swimming. I had mentioned how I loved to swim growing up and how that's just not something trans people can easily do, and this person came across empathetic, but directed the conversation toward forcing trans people into ""third spaces"" and actively shutting down any ideas I tried to help provide on how you could safely integrate trans people without doing that. Kind of a slow buildup to ""well it looks like you're the unreasonable one here"" accusations because I didn't accept their one exclusionary (and unfeasible) answer to the issue.

Actually made me more upset than if they'd just come out the gate flinging shit at me in the first place.
Yep. Really frustrating.
There‚Äôs a whole cottage industry built around it. Certain powerful parties would much rather get their base outraged about trans people existing than about how nobody can afford to live anymore, so we become ‚Äúthe trans question.‚Äù Sick stuff.
It's usually them getting the wrong end of the stick and conflating being trans with either crossdressing or forced feminization.

Still sucks ass to be on the receiving end of though
I am a cis woman. I am there because I want to know trans realities better to be an ally and also because my girlfriend is trans. I mainly read everyone and write when my input has a purpose. Reading such things, that people view trans woman as they do, makes my heart and my brain ache.
stereotypes and ignorance.
Probably some transfems being in the femboy and sissy communities, and posting porn in those communities to promote themselves. There is some overlap. Chasers also post across those communities too. I always crack up laughing when I see a transfem post in a trans subreddit something like, ""What's all this sissy shit about??? Where is this coming from???""

If you're just an ordinary transfem living your life, that fetish stuff doesn't really have anything to do with you.
There's a lot of good supportive cis friends/relatives of trans people here and eggs
I second this.
All of that! Everything you said. I only hope I‚Äôm doing things right haha! üíû
What Oscar said.
This makes me so happy. Thank you for allowing me into your space üíòüíòüíò
I appreciate that more than you know, I really try <3 y‚Äôall honestly deserve every single human that fights for you all <3
üíû thank you!
It turns into an argument every damn time. Like you answer the question and then they start getting defensive and saying the most transphobic bunch of shit you‚Äôve ever heard in your life, it‚Äôs exausting
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è and I'm sorry some people can't respect this space. I'm the mods work hard to remove the unwanted posts, but a few will always slip through unfortunately.
Yeah but what else can we do? We can't just let these bastards keep doing this. We have to do something and it might be drastic but something as simple as a mod seeing someone who identifies as cis and banning them. I get this is going to be unpopular opinion, but we have to do something because trans people need a space for only trans people. 

Plus like I've said it isn't unprecedented, there are women only, and black only spaces amongst many other identities yet rarely any only dedicated to trans people, with the few that do seemingly getting either 
A. Some kind of civil war over identity facilities by trolls.
B.getting run over by bigots and such
Or C. A combination of the two.
We need to promote an actually safe space where Trans people get be safe, actually safe not like it is rn.
Listen I get it but there are tons of other subs, I'm not trying to invalidate you or your experience but you are definitely outnumbered by your bigoted peers. For every one person who is like you there are atleast 100 that come here to troll trans people for the lolz. Also I'm tired of the fight and shit, this is only sub where trans people can just interact. 

I'm tired of the ""fight"" we must go through I just need a place to detox from all the shit people put me through and every other trans sub besides transpositive seems to have become more toxic and bitter. Idk about anyone else but there are tons of better subs for getting trans allies like r/asktransgender among others like the aforementioned transpostive.
Yeah‚Ä¶. I can see that. They might not know about it maybe ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idk. I just always try to give ppl the benefit of the doubt.
That's the way. If you're rude, you only strengthen their beliefs that we are ""sick"", ""craz,"" whatever. Be nice and friendly, but know where to draw the line. 
You go!
exactly this. it seems to always fall on the victims to appease and be patient with people bluntly bringing up traumatizing subjects and openly denying their claims rather than everyone else for being emotionally disconnected enough to stay rational, gentle and open minded and do their own damn research when there are things they dont understand.

i know some people seem to prefer asking others rather than asking google, but come on most of these questions have been repeated a thousand times so surely your take is not so unique that you can find something similar yourself rather than potentially retraumatizing a bunch of marginalized people.
I find it helpful to interrogate them and their premises, to not let them move freely between assumptions and instead force them clarify themselves or not get the validation of conversation.
I don't think they deserve any attention at all, so why even engage them? In the end they're incapable of change.
Not that many and I'm rarely find a cis people who are tolerant much less supportive of trans people so I doubt it. Plus we need to nip it in the bud. We have spaces for allies to have, trans people need a trans only space. Literally every other group I've seen has been ok with having a space that doesn't include allies just for the sake of getting a breather. 

Plus they literally have the rest of the fucking world as their space, they can do with us having a small subreddit to call the trans home.
Here‚Äôs to changing the world ü•Ç glad to have people like you by our side!
Seriously! When was it ever an argument??? Why are you suddenly defensive??
Maybe instead of a ban hammer, there could be a bot that we can use as a command to redirect cis people to askreddits? Or a specific rule that cis people shouldn't come here asking questions, and therefore removing posts entailing that.

I just personally don't like the idea of banning *everyone* who could be cis. It's easy for that to go down a bad road, and harm others in the process. Plus, it would ve awkward and difficult to execute.
You're right, but I think maybe a good solution would be mods enforcing more strict rules. Like if someone posts something with the slightest transphobic innuendo, banned
I am cis and joined this sub to see if there are any ways to support a family member who has come out as trans. I‚Äôve not posted or commented before, I just want to learn how to help a loved one through a transition. I think banning people because of the way they were born is very unfair. If a conservative sub banned all lgbtq+ people many of the members might support it but that would be disgusting and fundamentally wrong. Banning one group of people is segregating and would be fuel to feed the anti-trans agenda because it makes trans people seem different when we‚Äôre all just people. Gender doesn‚Äôt matter, most of us are here to support one another with this topic. Perhaps a better solution would be to more heavily moderate the sub. If a cis person has questions, they should be pointed towards r/asktransgender and any potentially offensive comments removed.
I could honestly say the same üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üëèüëèüëè
I don't get where this attitude comes from either. It's like some some kind of ego thing. ""Oh I think you are less than human, what you wouldn't date me because I think that? How dare you! I'm supposed to be the one telling you no!"" 

They act like they are being forced to date us or something, but it doesn't even occur to them that I would never date anyone who thinks I am beneath them.
Probably because they don‚Äôt get the answer they wanted to hear. We say ‚Äúhey, that‚Äôs actually a very transphobic thing to say‚Äù and they freak out. I‚Äôm pretty sure those people never actually wanted to learn in the first place.
A redirect bot would be just as hard and would help nothing really. That rule sounds good but imo those who do break it should get banned instead of post removal. Drastic times and such. Plus we NEED atleast this place to be for trans. Though imo I don't think cis people should really be here, they have the whole of reddit besides here to browse without hate, trans people don't. 
One of things I've never gotten was letting non queer people into queer spaces, they have everywhere else why let them fuck up that space?
i agree that this sub shouldnt ban cis people, but in no way should this be compared to segregation just because you may feel left out. given the context of the groups of people this is about, you arent entitled to every one of our spaces.
You forget that we're not segregating we just want our own space. Think of it as a club for instance, not everyone is invited to certain clubs, and it is doubly important because cis people are fucking assholes seemingly. Yes some aren't but I've not met many who are really considerate of trans peoples feelings to any point that they feel safe. 
Plus this is a subreddit, an online space. Transphobes will use anything for fuel against us so least we can have is a small sub reddit.
<3
They want to feel morally superior SO BAD, It's physically painful to watch. Like, first of all, most of us are t4t, including me. A lot of us don't want you, either. 

P.S. shouldn't they worry about pulling cis people first anyways? üëÄ
The fastest way to piss off a bigot is to call them one or point out their bigotry."	w72h8q	trans	930	0.96	2022-07-24 18:35:19
My fianc√© gets extremely upset and mad at me because of things I can‚Äôt do normally because I‚Äôm trans.	"The title basically says it all but I will elaborate.
I am ftm and I‚Äôve been with my partner for over 3 years. I love her to death and she is my whole world. But sometimes I feel horrible because of things that hinder me because I am not cis‚Ä¶and tbh, she‚Äôs the one making me feel horrible. While she is so supportive otherwise I‚Äôm every other aspect, when it comes to anything that puts a damper on her plans, it‚Äôs like the whole world is ending and I have to pay for it. For instance, recently I wasn‚Äôt able to go to a gathering where some of her friends were because I was having really horrible anxiety about not passing and not being accepted. Instead of comforting her, she acted as though I was hindering her from going because she wanted to go with me. She got all upset and shut down.

The same thing happened again today. Her dad and stepmom wanted to go on a trip to out of the country‚Ä¶a country where being trans is criminalized‚Ä¶ I told her I‚Äôd need to do some research to make sure it was okay for me to go too but I wasn‚Äôt sure and that I was really sorry that she has to deal with this. She completely shut down and when I tried to explain it to her again and how sorry I was she got so upset and said she wasn‚Äôt stupid and she understood. She then proceeded to not talk to me and we still haven‚Äôt spoken.

Idk what to do, I feel like I am just constantly disappointing her and this isn‚Äôt something she would have to deal with if I was cis. It is honestly making me feel so dysphoric and I hate myself even more and can‚Äôt bear to look at myself. I just wish Things were different."	"That doesn‚Äôt sound very supportive or like she knows how to communicate at all. You should definitely not be forced to go to a country where it‚Äôs illegal to be trans or she throws a temper tantrum and ignores you. 

You gotta take care of your own safety first. I feel you on the anxiety portion though, I almost never leave my apartment now due to it
If my partner got pissy at me for not wanting to go to a country where I might be killed just for existing, I'd have a hand on the Eject button ready to run.
I just tried to talk to her about it. She completely flipped out. We got into a huge fight and now we won‚Äôt be sleeping in the same room. My heart is so broken. She just doesn‚Äôt think the way she acts is wrong. I don‚Äôt even know how to convey myself to her. I am so unbelievably upset.
Well... if she doesn't care about your mental well-being or literal physical and legal safety... things could change, with a change of partner :/

I'm so sorry you're going through this.
This is emotional abuse. Also, not worrying about your safety first in a country where being trans is criminalized is a HUGE red flag. There are plenty of wonderful places to visit where you won't be jailed or killed. 

Lastly, even cis people get anxiety. Her complete lack of empathy is astounding. Sorry, OP.
Dafuq man. My fianc√©e legit just let me bail on a gathering of her friends because she knows it makes me anxious to be around people I don't know for fear of passing. Yours doesn't sound super supportive... she's using emotional blackmail. You should really reevaluate the relationship if she can't respect your boundaries.
This relationship sounds kinda toxic. I think you might need to talk it out with them since they do not seem to really care about you and your mental health.
Sounds like abusive ex....
Fiance you say? So there's still time to break things off with her before the government knows you two dated? I honestly think you should break up with her if she wants you to go with her to a country that is physically unsafe for you and refuses to comfort you or support you when you have concerns about being accepted and passing. It shows that she cares more about her wants than your life and safety. I think that can be categorized as some level of emotional abuse or manipulation...
Leave. Just leave. Doesn't matter how much you care about her rn, she's manipulating, gaslighting and emotionally abusing you here. You deserve someone better than her.
This is sounding very much so like the situation I had with my now ex. She was very supportive in theory, but there were so many issues over minor things and gaslighting that began to happen. Things I couldn't do began to grate on her and she started blaming issues we were having on my being trans -- eventually starting to accuse me that I was going to leave her for a man when I started hormones (still almost exclusively into women.) Ultimately I realized this was emotional abuse.

Getting dysphoria and having to cancel plans is super normal, *especially* early on. And worrying about your safety is extremely valid. Her not understanding these things is a huge red flag. I don't know enough about you both and your relationship to give solid advice, but TBH the snapshot you just told everyone here is giving me strong GTFO vibes.
Honestly she seems like a closeted transphobic if that makes sense, my ex boyfriend who was ftm wouldn‚Äôt let me even try to look femm claiming me trying to lessen my dysphoria made his worse , he basically shoved me back in the closet all while claiming to support me
I feel like you did nothing wrong. I'm not calling her a bad person though either. It sounds like she is just not able to be supportive of you right now. Maybe she could grow and change and learn how to be a more supportive partner though. The best advice I can give is to be honest with her, try to help her understand you.
Just gonna float this out there, that if a country/area isn't favourable to trans-rights, let alone criminalizes us, it's not a country that I would want to go to as a CIS person either. There are plenty of great countries that you can go to as a tourist that will be warm, accepting and nice places: why waste money in one that disrespects basic human rights?

&#x200B;

If my partner had a problem with me refusing to go to one of these countries, I'd have a very serious problem with how they were viewing our relationship.
""baby I can't come with you, they might literally kill me...""

""I can't believe you're ruining our getaway!""

Doesn't sound like a healthy relationship, but then again I wouldn't  know ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
She isn't supportive, sounds like that she only care about herself, maybe she doesn't see you as her partner, instead more like a puppet with out will or feelings.
Get out of there, you deserve better, she is not supporting you
She seems like a narcissist putting the fact she's kinda disappointed about you nit going on vacation to somewhere you could fucking die ahead of the concern that you could. Yknow. Fucking die. 

Sorry to tell you but if ""I have to ensure my safety over going on this vacation with you"" is a problem u aren't dealing w a reasonable person, you're dealing w someone who blames you for being trans and hates it but knows she's ""supposed"" to support you. Acting like you're the problem for having anxiety is disgusting and personally i hope you break up and get with someone who respects you and doesn't try to manipulate you into thinking being trans is the problem when it's the fact her family decided to take their trans soon to be kid in law to a country where it's criminalized. It sounds like a ""they'll have to come to their senses and stop this trans nonsense once we're there!"" With no other thought about what that would mean or how it would effect you or if you would literally get fucking murdered for existing as yourself. Sincerely, get the fuck out of there. I know it's hard, but in no world is this not a manipulation tactic to get you to treat her being upset as more important than your actual life or who you are. Whether they realize it or not, everything about this is transphobic, manipulative,  and dangerous as hell.
On the second point, absolutely. You need to be safe. On the first point - is this something you do often? Worry so much about passing that you don't get involved with any of her social occasions? In that case, yeah, maybe you need to be more willing to let other people's opinions of you go. What does it matter if a total stranger isn't sure about you? Doesn't like you? It's a hard lesson but once you've learned that you are NOT responsible for how other people think and feel about you, and that's ok - then it's very, very freeing. I'm on the spectrum and am used to people either liking me or just plain not liking me ON SIGHT! All through my school years etc it really bothered me. Now I just accept it. Can't be friends with everyone. And that's ok. Focus on those tht like you for who you are.
This sounds JUST like my ex.. who is my ex for good reason. üòÖ
She's being completely fucking unreasonable, trying to get you to visit a country with anti-trans laws is basically asking for you to get arrested or killed
This might not be what you want to hear, but she most definitely is NOT supportive of you, OP. Although you may not wanna do it, I think it may be best to go your separate ways. If she really threw a fit over your safety, she most definitely doesn‚Äôt care about it. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this, bro.
I have a very supportive family and extended family but some of my grandparents didn‚Äôt understand or just sucked at getting my name and pronouns right. This lead to me deciding to stay home from family gatherings to avoid getting misgendered and the mental anguish that was sure to fallow until 3am when I could finally fall asleep. Although it made my parents a bit sad a my extended family too they didn‚Äôt say anything and my mom always made sure to tell me she understands and hopes that someday I‚Äôll feel comfortable and happy to hang out with them. That is being supportive. I understand your fianc√©‚Äôs feelings but it‚Äôs not her place to blame you and punish you by not talking to you. I would put tell her how you feel and tell her that if she feels bad then she can feel sad with you and not at you. Being trans sucks you I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt enjoy missing out on the things you would have been able to do if you were cis. I think if you can learn to be sad or disappointed with you then you guys could both feel a lot better and learn to work things out together. After all being in a relationship whether with family or a romantic one means your work together and solve things together.
The first one, while unpleasant, is understandable. It's possible you needed to do a better job of communicating the issue you were having, and it's possible she was the one having communication issues. It's possible both were true. Without having been there I couldn't say. But either way I'd want to remind you, both of you, that you're human. That sort of problem is going to come up in any relationship, the fact that the issue that started it related to you being trans is what's unique, but that's a problem that you can work through.

The second one made me completely reconsider. I don't know which country you're talking about, so I don't know what laws or punishments could happen there. But telling her you need to do some research for your own safety is not something she should be getting upset about. A vacation is not worth jail time in a foreign country, or worse.

Just from what you described here it sounds like you two are having communication issues, and that's something that can be worked through. You should talk to her about feeling like you're disappointing her. But for the vacation thing in particular, you need to be very clear that that's your life she's asking you to put on the line. Asking to be able to do research is not unreasonable.
Sounds like gaslighting to me, maybe she does it unintentionally, but still isn't healthy.

Your could try forcing yourself to go and not care about passing or not. Practice can kill anxiety.
She needs therapy. It‚Äôs a great way to learn communication. These shut downs sound like tantrums for not getting her way immediately.  Red flag in any relationship. Maybe couples therapy could help you both learn to communicate effectively together.
god this sounds like my ex

leave her, she doesn't deserve you
This does not sound like a healthy/supportive relationship my dude. You may want to seriously consider dropping her cause she sounds like an absolute nightmare to deal with.
OP,  that's called emotional blackmail. She doesn't sound very supportive, especially if she throws a tantrum cause you don't want to go somewhere you might be murdered.

I don't know your situation so only you can make this decision, but I'd critically examine your relationship and see if this is something you really want to stay in. Ask yourself, do you want to stay because you've been with her for three years and being with her is comfortable and familiar, or do you want to stay because you think this can work.

You can't change her. You can help teach her but only if she's willing to learn. Ask yourself, is she open to understanding your position and adjusting her behavior to make you comfortable? You can't control that so if the answer is no, there's nothing you can do to improve the situation. You can just stay and put up with it, or you can leave.
She sounds like she is getting upset that you are pointing these things out which may or may not make her feel like a bad person. Try saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre being transphobic or not supportive of me, these are just my concerns‚Äù 
Possibly try to educate her a little more without making her feel guilty for not knowing. Most people get hostile because they just don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs normal though!
I'm sorry but this person is meant to be your fiancee, not a source of your pain. Seems like she has no interest in the most basic bits of your transition or really any part of you. You asked for the absolute bare minimum and got zilch. Re-your comments, unless something really big changes really fast, it's over.
Dump her.
I'm no professional, but she sounds like an honestly horrible girlfriend.
Dont ever go to a country where being trans is criminalized they are allowed to prosecute you.
Ok, going to be a differing option, as a lot of the replies sound like r/relationshipadvise where any hitch is ""omfg that is manipulative break up now"".

First one, your anxiety and fear of not passing is keeping you, and potentially her, from going to social events. Is this a common occurrence? Is this something that she has expressed wanting you to work on? As someone who's had a relationship with someone with depression and anxiety, no matter how much support you give, it can also be frustrating and difficult on yourself. 

Is this something you are actively working on conquering? Are you getting your anxiety treated?

As for the travel, this sounds like to her a continuation of the above; may be perceived as your anxiety restricting social and life events, making her miss out on them too as she doesn't want to ditch you.

 Does she end up feeling guilty if she goes to events without you?

You mentioned issues not passing; would that mean you pass fine as your AGAB, so travel isn't going to be a real big deal as no one will peg you? And are we talking Iran, or USA when saying being trans is outlawed?
Sometimes people are unable to express themselves fully, nor may their communication be super honest when they are doing something they‚Äôre not proud of. Putting you in difficult/dangerous situations or blaming you sounds like someone struggling to not take ownership of how they are feeling and making you the problem.

I feel bad saying this but it could be they are unable to say this relationship is not working and over for them and creating an environment where you are unable to continue ‚Ä¶and you become the one that does what they are unable to do and say and end the relationship. Sort of doing the dirty work for them.

If this is a possibility you can try couple therapy and see if it could be worked out? But you may need to do what‚Äôs best for you first.

Please understand all the comments are well meaning, including mine, but you‚Äôll need to process them only the way you can and do what‚Äôs right for you.
Sounds like it's her problem, not yours. I'd say sit down & have a conversation about how these things make you feel, how her reactions make you feel and about *why* she gets so upset over these things: is she mad at the world? Is she mad about this stuff on your behalf? Is she mad that you're apologising for things beyond your control? Is she mad that she can't just snap her fingers and make everything easier for you? Or is she mad that you're trans? Every answer *except* the last one is OK & good, and something that you can build on together. If it's the last one then it's time to reconsider whether this is the type of relationship you want with a partner.
You may just be incompatible. If you are communicating and she just gets upset and won't budge, you are a stalemate. 

You can try to talk it out trying to see if you can salvage her but most likely she has already made up her mind. If she views your gender as troublesome to her, there's not much you can do.
she honestly doesn't sound very supportive if she's saying these kind of things and refusing to listen properly when you try to explain your situation. this sounds like a toxic relationship, and if it's taking a toll on your mental health i would suggest either taking a break from the relationship and taking sometime for yourself or end it. you don't need those kind of people on your life. hope you can work something out and best of luck. <3
I'm sorry but this is manipulation 

She is being selfish and inconsiderate. She is throwing temper tantrums because you are not literally risking your life for her field trip, and it's stupid that she really wants it that bad that she doesn't care that you can literally get killed just because of who you are.

Tbh I say that you need another person in your life that doesn't drain it and your energy/happiness and that you deserve someone who understands and ACTUALLY supports you 

Good luck dude I hope you can soon find that person and get better
You deserve better! You deserve understanding and support and love, not getting emotionally damaged every time you have anxiety or stressed about something. It doesn‚Äôt seem fair she‚Äôs doing this to you. You need to tell her things need to change or you should leave her she sounds like she‚Äôs hurting you in more ways then you realize and will cause more issues for you later in life. Please be safe and don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel that way you do now. Life is too short to let those that ‚Äúlove‚Äù take us down when we need to be lifted.
Sounds to me like narcissistic abuse, to be honest! I‚Äôm a survivor of that also! I‚Äôve never felt accepted, never felt truly loved by family. They were never happy with my ‚Äòresults‚Äô or accomplishments! It‚Äôs like a rollercoaster of bad feelings. Day in Day out! I hope you are safe now?
Yeah um idk if the rings lookin to be a good fit. Keep trying. Obvi but the fact that u feel that she feels annoyed means ur probaly right. And she shouldnt feel that way if she plans on spending the rest of her life with u
Shes behaving like a spoilt brat
Your fiance doesn't really seem to have the personality type and lifestyle that conforms to a healthy relationship ever blossoming with a trans person.  Sorry OP but you should seriously reconsider marriage.
Yo dude, I'm pretty sure you pass if you have a girl it means they're attracted
I could kind of understand the first story. But as soon as I read that she got angry because you didn't know about going to a country where you could be arrested and killed just for being you. I'm sorry, but that is a huge red flag and she is using emotional abuse against you.
Aroace here but that seems kinda toxic
She clearly cannot communicate her feelings in a healthy way for a relationship. I would try to be as open as possible and tell her how you feel as much as you can and tell her that she needs to work on communicating her feelings as well (don't put it as bluntly as that I just couldn't think of another way to say it). But in the end if you've done all you can and she isn't making you feel good, you may have to end it.
It's not good that she shuts down when confronted with challenges, that is a very childish way to process problems. I initially wrote handle instead of process, but she's not handling anything if she's shutting down. People that do this don't just get over it one day either, if she's not working on this either on her own or with a therapist of some kind then it's not going to get better. 

I had a fiance like this myself at one point, I didn't go through with it because that behavior really got to me after a while. Shutting down is a manipulation tactic, instead of wanting to work it out, they want you to feel so bad inside that you capitulate to their desires, that's frankly really fucked up, they don't care about your position, your feelings, how you see things, they will not re-engage until they get their way or they've moved past it emotionally enough to pretend it never happened but the second you come back to the issue it'll happen all over again.

If this person is shutting down when it comes to an issue of potential life and death for you, they are not a good partner. If something happened in that country because you're trans, they'd probably be mad at you for being trans/being caught and wouldn't have your back. I'm sorry you're faced with this situation it sounds truly miserable, I hope you can find a decision that makes you happy.
sounds like you're dating a child, time to move on
man she should feel lucky she found you. shes being a twit for nothing and inconsiderate as fuck
Dump her. Dump her now, and she will have plenty of time to arrange her trip. It's clearly very important to her, and the best way to be supportive of her dreams is to set her free. Love is hard like that sometimes. It's really best for the both of you to go separate ways now, and just be glad you figured it out before you have three kids and a geriatric cat together. I'm sorry. That sucks a lot.
What you're describing seems to be the opposite of supportive. And even a little childish. When children can get things to go **their** way, they get upset and throw a tantrum. That's seems to be what your fianc√© does as well.

I can't tell you what to do. But **I** wouldn't keep a relationship with someone that isn't supportive and makes me feel bad. There are enough people in the world trying to bring me down already.
My friend, this is not what real love and acceptance look like. There will be difficult topics to navigate in any relationship, maybe a few more in a relationship where one of you is trans, but these are NOT those issues. Trying to figure out kids in the future can be complicated when you aren't both cis, but throwing a tantrum because your fiance is scared to enter a country where they could be jailed on sight is so fucked up I don't have adequate words for it.

Genuine love is unselfish. Be unselfish and keep looking until you find someone unselfish. Compatibility matters of course, attraction, all that; but if you're both unselfish it builds a relationship where you each take each other into account ALWAYS. I wasted years of my life throwing all my love and time into people who were black holes; I cared about their happiness and gave them everything I had assuming they would do the same, but they didn't. For years I thought that was just how it was, or that it was all I deserved so I settled.

When I met my husband (we're nearing the ten year mark) I realized that no one before him had ever loved me, not really. Turned out he'd been drowning in the black holes as well.

Another note, the constant ""shutting down"" is unfair to you both. If she has things to say that she's swallowing they will fester and cause much worse problems later; it also stops both of you from continuing to try and resolve the situation. Only you truly know your relationship, but at the very least I would recommend couples counseling (if she'll agree to it) or solo counseling to get help on opening the lines of communication. If you can't talk about your problems you will never be able to get past them.

I really hope things turn out well for you; you deserve to be loved and cared for, don't ever doubt or forget that.

Edit: holy cow that was longer than intended. TLDR: no relationship can survive without good communication and you deserve to be with someone who will take your needs into account as much as their own.
Genuinely consider couples therapy. It simply sounds like some communication issues that can be pretty easily resolved. Too many people here seem to think the solution is always ""leave them"" when that isn't really the case.
I know it‚Äôs scary being alone, especially if there are some aspects of the relationship you do enjoy and treasure. But your partner is being emotionally abusive, and absolutely NOT supporting you. The way I see it you have four options:

1) Break it off now. The simplest and probably best option, but also easy for us on the internet who aren‚Äôt in a committed 3-year long relationship to flippantly suggest.

2) Spend the rest of your life in an emotionally abusive marriage where your identity as a transgender person is not respected.

3) Eventual divorce, which is step 1 with more pain and wasted time.

4) Tell her how you feel, not as a suggestion, but as a fact. Tell her she has been invalidating you and treating you poorly and you won‚Äôt accept it- either she comes to couples counseling with you and grows and becomes a better partner, or you can‚Äôt be with her anymore.

4 would be swell‚Ä¶if she‚Äôs mature enough to accept her flaws and try to grow.
Wtf‚Ä¶ does she not realise how difficult being trans is for YOU? I‚Äôm so sorry that she treats you like a hinderance.. you deserve to be treated better, you didn‚Äôt ask to be trans (or ask for the things that, unfortunately, come with it.)

You‚Äôre a man. You‚Äôre a man no matter if you‚Äôre cis or trans. I hope she sees that!
Ummm‚Ä¶ RUN!! And quickly!!
Just dump her honestly lol
Maybe be like ‚Äúyou want me to go because you love me right? And you care about me? Well I really would love to go but I need to make sure I‚Äôd be safe so we can enjoy the vacation. In some countries I can get killed for being myself and I need to look after myself too. Idk maybe say smthn like that..?
If she's giving you the cold shoulder that's actually emotional abuse...

Edit: Just read the bit where she wanted to go to a country where being trans is criminalized and then threw a fit when you were like ""Idk I'm not sure about that""...?! Why are you still with her? She is going to put in danger one way or another! Not only that but she keeps acting like a child and her communication skills are piss poor!
Why can't she go alone? I mean ye it sucks to not have ur partner with u when going out but she's her own person and can go alone when u r not comfortable
Okay a lot of people are advising you to end the relationship here but I get the feeling that's not what you want. Especially because people are reading that she s throwing temper tantrums when the reality is that she's withdrawing from you. 

What this sounds like to me is that she feels like she can't talk about her feelings when your identity makes her life harder. She feels like those reactions on her part aren't valid and isn't willing to express them for fear of sounding like a bigot or like she doesn't care. Problem is, you're an attentive enough partner to notice the pattern. When you bring it up, she gets defensive because she's doing her best to not have you notice how she feels.

While both of your actions here are rooted in caring about each other's feelings, the lack of communication is poison and has already caused conflict. What I would suggest first is reassuring her that you aren't angry at her for being sad about the trip, you're worried that she won't talk to you. Maybe go to couple's counselling if you think it's needed. But just forcing her to talk about how she feels will only result in more fights.

And to y'all in the comments, cut the fiancee some slack. Being a supportive cis partner is hard, particularly if your family doesn't get it and does things like plan a trip for you and your partner to bigoted countries. I played that role before coming out myself.
I know you said you love this person, so I‚Äôll refrain from being an ass about it. 

However, I fail to see how any of this is your fault, your partner should be there for you through hell or high water (of course there is more nuance than that but I hope most get the gist of that statement). 

This is where I‚Äôm might actually get offensive and if I do offend then my apologies, but your relationship has been going for three. f*ing. years. It‚Äôs not like this fucking cropped up out of no where, she fucking knew there was going to be more nuance to dating a trans  ftm person, because as much as I hate to say it, we are not accepted by many even in more progressive areas.

Like if I was ever in a relationship for that long, and a person started gaslighting me about not going to a place where I might LITERALLY FUCKING BE EXECUTED OR PUT IN PRISON, I would start reevaluating that relationship immediately.

Also communication is part of the relationship, if she shuts you down and tries to make it a you problem every time you try to communicate a concern then it‚Äôs time for some self reflection on her part. 

Not gonna lie, I‚Äôm a lot more angry than the above words let on so Imma stop here.
I'm really sorry you're going through this I've had my fair share of experience with abuse in relationships unfortunately and it's never easy to get out you always feel like you need to be better for them or that their abuse is justified somehow the only advice I can give is to do what I did just tell someone you trust about the situation and let them help you in whatever ways they can maybe not the ways my friends helped me get out lol but still it's a good start to just reach out you don't even have to ask specifically for help usually people hear that shit and they're the ones who offer to help
No, your partner is NOT being at all supportive here. This is ridiculous and your partner is an entitled self absorbed piece of shit.

They aren‚Äôt allowed to be upset because you are concerned about your LIFE in a country that is hostile to you.

I can‚Äôt stand everyone who jumps to ‚Äúyour partner is bad just leave them‚Äù but your partner is getting upset about your concern for your life. That is disgusting and I am sorry your fianc√© is a horrible inconsiderate person.
OP this sounds similar to one of those scenarios where a parent says I support the LGBTQ+ community and then abuses their queer child. She sounds toxic and not emotionally ready to deal with the world. Maybe ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù or ‚Äúbrat‚Äù is the word. You need to run bro! Your mental well being ain‚Äôt worth sacrificing for a bitch.
Hun that doesn‚Äôt sound like a partner. I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôd call a person like that but your last point was terrifying to read. I sincerely hope that your fianc√© gets help and that you do no go on that trip. That trip is more like a trap. pls stay safe
i would try to talk to her about it in a civilized manner, about how shes making you feel. and if she doesn‚Äôt understand.. go from there.. from what i‚Äôve read here it sounds like she doesn‚Äôt really support you emotionally when it comes to trans and mental health issues. 3 years is a long time to be with someone, but if theres more issues down the line this will just pile up. then when you‚Äôve been dating for even longer it‚Äôll be harder to let go. if it comes to that. 

this is coming from someone who is FTM and has been dating the same cis woman for 6 years. early in my transition when i had more passing anxiety, she always understood. shes been with me since i was pre everything (long hair, forced to wear dresses, etc). if she discovered that the vacation spot was in a country illegal to be trans? there is no way either one of us would want to go. no ifs, ands, or buts. 
i‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, i know it‚Äôs hard to realize that you‚Äôre not being supported by someone you love. i hope you two can talk this out and meet in the middle here. feel free to reach out if you need support!
She's wrong to act like that. None of this is your fault. She's either struggling with expressing disappointment in an appropriate manner, or she's a selfish asshole.

Actually, it reminds me of my autistic friends somewhat. Trouble anticipating someone's concerns, and stress when changing plans. Although it could be a coincidence.

Whatever the problem is, it's a problem coming from her, not you. Does she see someone for mental health support? She seems to have a high baseline stress level.

And does she do other toxic behaviour? You might want to think hard about what the purpose of partnership is.

Sorry you're dealing with such stressful things.
If she throws a fit because you are scared of going to a country where being trans can GET YOU LANDED IN JAIL, if not worse - that‚Äôs not a healthy relationship. That is your girlfriend being entitled and selfish, and not taking YOUR needs into consideration.

I can‚Äôt tell you what to do, but from the outside looking in - there are red flags going up all over the place. And you deserve better than this.
This relationship sounds wrong for you. Even if you WERE cis, she should respect you not feeling comfortable going out. You have to make sacrifices in a relationship sure but if you‚Äôre fearing for your safety she should understand.
The lack of adding any ages isn't helping me think that the SO is young and very immature in terms if emotional intelligence.
Yeah the first one I was like 

""Yeah ok sure it sucks when someone is having a tough time and can't go out I can see her getting a bit mad even if she handled it poorly""

The second one? Are you fucking stupid, why are you trying to bring a trans person somewhere they could be arrested and killed. That's just grade A idiocy
This chick gets it!
Ok I said I would stop writing, now I‚Äôm fucking infuriated even further, this isn‚Äôt just fucking gaslighting you for your concerns, the gas was already lit and now 5 tons of gasoline has been dumped on top of it.

Stop feeling horrible because you are trying to communicate your concerns and she‚Äôs being a fucking child about it. SHE IS LITERALLY talking about you all going to a country where you being you IS CRIMINALIZED, and she has the fucking audacity to say she isn‚Äôt wrong. Fuck that noise.
Get out of that relationship NOW. This person is going to get you killed.
Imo she doesn't sound like she is trying to be kind to you at all. I am not trans but my fianc√© is and I have seen lots of posts like this talking about how a partner feels like that have it hard because they're dating someone who is trans. Tbh I think that's bs. There have been times when maybe I wanted to go to a restaurant or something as a date with my gf, but she didn't feel comfortable because she felt she wouldn't be able to pass well without a mask. I was never once upset with her because she felt uncomfortable being in public. I just found it upsetting that all we wanted to do was go on a date but the world we live in makes her feel like she can't do that. It never was and never will be her fault that things like this happen. I can't think of any other situation where people would agree that being uncomfortable is upsetting or annoying. I wouldn't force you to play with my dog if you said you were scared of dogs, I wouldn't force you to let me be intimate with you if you said you were uncomfortable, and I wouldn't force you to go anywhere with me if you said you didn't want to. When someone is in love with you they should want to do things that would make you happy. Love isn't supposed to be selfish. Hopefully this made sense and I hope in the future you aren't made to feel like you're the problem, because you are not.
OP, PLEASE break up with her! Even though she says she's supportive, She isn't.
This is abusive and gaslighting.

I would encourage you to rethink whether this relationship is healthy and worth staying in
This person is so wrapped up in their own negative feelings that they can't consider anyone else, it's not healthy. I'm sorry you have to go through this. If you stay with her there is a good chance she will continue shutting down/flipping out over smaller and smaller perceived disappointments as time goes on until there's no room left to breathe in the relationship.
I know a lot of people have responded to you, but if i can give you one takeaway: your mental well-being is  important. 

It may be hard to hear and do, but she sounds abusive, manipulative, and selfish and you should probably consider breaking up. She doesn't sound understanding of your feelings; there is no reciprocation. Please evaluate your own worth hun!
i‚Äôd finish that relation if it were me. she sounds all but supportive
OP, you deserve better. Please reevaluate if you wanna deal with this for the rest of your life.
Yo so I had a fiance that would do the thing. I won't say if I'm Trans or not, but the issues weren't about Trans issues. But sounds like the same thing. They might not be intentionally being manipulative but they are non the less being it. If they shut down or make how you feel about them. That's when you gotta end it. I went two years with that. I'd suggest you dip while you can
Blessed and beloved. Please don‚Äôt let yourself get killed. I am very upset that your fianc√©e is throwing a fit that you won‚Äôt travel someplace that is a literal hazard to your life.

You are precious and valuable and deserve to be cherished and protected.  Your fianc√©e is not looking after your best interests.

Please be safe and well üíúüôè
She's self-centered and whether she means it or not, she's abusive. If she won't change her tune, you should leave her.
That sounds really painful for you. Having been one to see dysfunctional relationships up close, I give you this. If you feel she loves you truly, then there‚Äôs probably something else wrong that is getting triggered by your particular needs. For example, is she always the one supporting your anxieties? Do you support her in similar ways? The best thing before you hit eject is to find a couples therapist you both like. Even if it doesn‚Äôt heal things between you, you‚Äôre guaranteed to come out of it with personal growth
as the cis wife of a trans woman, I COMPLETELY AGREE. I don't understand how anyone could look at the person they cherish most and think ""huh. I think ill pressure them to cross into a place that has a real chance of killing them"" and when they say ""wait, I am uncomfortable!"" Blowing up.

I am SPEECHLESS. Never, in all my time with my wife (and I dated her for 4 years before she came out) and during any part of her transition did I decide that my wants and desires outweighed her own happiness and more importantly, HER SAFETY. 

AND THIS WAS FOR A VACATION. Mother of god. Just how nauseatingly apathetic can one person get?

Just...what the fuck. I am so furious at this partner. This is NOT a partner. This is a selfish person with so little regard for someone they love that convenience trumps their very survival. the true selfish apathy in that is just...horrific.

OP I hope you leave her. This relationship cannot move forward. Not with this kind of sheer lack of empathy, care, or regard for your own life at even the most fundamental of levels.
Thats so many levels of fucked.
That sucks.

I was in transmasc-transfem relationship that started pre-transition. Before our eggs cracked, we tried to live vicariously through eachother (she tried to make me grow my hair out and I tried to make her get a haircut for instance)...

But once we knew we were trans, we supported eachother. We had opposite needs and there was a lot of ""I can't believe you actually enjoy xyz"" but we never tried to impede eachother! We even did our shots together and traded clothes...

Basically I'm trying to say you were right to expect better treatment.
>I‚Äôm not calling her a bad person though either.

I am. It‚Äôs not just that she‚Äôs sad and disappointed her fianc√© might not be able to go to a country where being trans is criminalized; she‚Äôs angry at OP instead of the laws oppressing him and has shown absolutely no understanding nor empathy toward a situation that is much worse for him. Decent people don‚Äôt do that. Even if she has the ability to change and become more supportive, something she‚Äôs seemingly shown no signs of possibly doing, at this point she is a bad, abusive person OP should remove from his life.
This. So much this.
A little update. I spoke to her again and tried to explain myself. I told her I was concerned because this has happened in the past and it‚Äôs concerning that this is an issue we have. She got upset and said that I was bringing up old fights and throwing them in her face and that I was rude/mean and manipulative. 
I really don‚Äôt know where to go from here tbh. I love her deeply but this hurts me a lot.

For those asking, I don‚Äôt often get anxiety when we are going out with people. It did earlier in my transition. I mainly got anxious because someone there hasn‚Äôt seen me since my transition, and I got a bit overwhelmed.

The reason this has happened often is because her family loves going on trips and does often. We have even went to some states where I have gotten death stares and upsetting comments from people. This kind of thing would bring me anxiety and essentially ruin a good day or two of my trip and upset me and she just doesn‚Äôt understand. She acts like I‚Äôm a burden when this happens and I don‚Äôt know how to navigate it.

As for passing, I do pass pretty well now, but I don‚Äôt have top surgery and if you stare long enough, you‚Äôd know.
Yup. Reebaluate what you want and need out ofthat relationship. 

Before this here I would have recomended writing letters to order your own thought, but fliping out because you look out for your own life is just not ok.
It's sad that this extreme of a statement isn't hyperbole. Literally she might get you killed OP. What if she wants to go somewhere in the US full of religious hicks? There are tons of places in the south I would not feel safe. If she gives you the same reaction and forces you to go to places that are obviously dangerous it might not end well for both of you when Y'alqaeda decides to pull a hate crime.

OP, she's completely ignoring your feelings, which is bad enough on its own, but also ignoring reality.
THIS‚¨ÜÔ∏èTHIS IS WHAT A SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE! This is what everyone deserves OP, don't settle for less because someone says they love you when their actions don't say the same.
Best comment on all of reddit, right there. Even if it wasn't focusing on trans people, EVERYONE looking to get in a relationship, or who is already in one, needs to read this and be more like you.

Not having empathy does not equal bad person. It means struggling to have empathy. People can change, and sometimes they just need a wake up call. Maybe they don't even realize how much their actions are hurting anther person. 

I am an alcoholic (which is certainly not the same as my gender identity, but I also am nonbinary, I just want to use this as an example) and I find most people have either 0 ability to empathize with someone with addiction, or they ...literally don't believe that anyone with addiction isn't like...a moral failure or something. It can be really frustrating when my friends cannot understand when I say I don't want to drink but I also undertand they probably ...just aren't alcoholics, or don't struggle with addiction. It's difficult. Empathy is difficult. 

Listen, I get your idea. Breaking up would be a way to escape this situation, but I am assuming the OP loves this person. We don't know how much they have talked to this person or tried to help their fiance understand them better. My own partner did not understand my alcoholism I mentioned. She also didn't understand some aspects fo my sexuality. I had to teach her. I had to walk her through stuff. It's complicated and messy. But in the end, she knows me better now. she is better able to empathize with me, and our love has grown because of it. Finding some ""ideal"" person who understands you perfectly sound great, but in reality that is pretty hard, especially for trans and queer people. I think its a lot easier to find someone who is openminded and willing to listen (I don't think we know from this explaination whether the OPs fiance will be wililng to hear him or not). 

Listen I don't know what will happen when the OP tries to talk to his fiance. It might go badly. But this person is his fiance, I assume there is a reason they got to this point. Maybe this fiance could change, could come through, come learn to empathize. I don't know your age (as in the person I'm replying to), but I'll say this : I know a lot of very very lonely people in their mid thirties and fourties who are still looking for some ""perfect partner"". Some of them had pretty deep relationships they gave up on...without even attempting to talk to that person or help them understand them. I don't think giving up is always the right solution. Relationships are hard, messy, and complicated. Deep lifelong ones 10x or 100x more so. I don't think we (as in you and me) know enough about this situation to recommend break up. I see a lot of ""just break up with them"" or ""just remove them from your life"" on forums like this, and I'm just not sure that is always the best solution. I'm sure if I'd brought issues I had with my partner to forums like this, people would have recommended the same. But I am madly in love with her. She has continued and continued and continued to become a better partner to me, and I believe I have done the same for her. It has been messy. It has not always been pretty. But the person who once dismissed my alcoholism as essentially not real now actively tries to help me resist temptation. The person dismissed some aspects of my gender expression as ""odd"" now gets actively angry at others who treat me that way, and is hella supportive.
Dude, for real, she sounds awful. Brother to brother here, don't stay with this spoiled brat of a girl. She isn't worth it. There's so many better women out there that will respect, protect, and honor your boundaries like the king you are. Go find your queen. Because this girl ain't it.
If this is a relationship you aren't ready to end, I would seriously suggest professional help. It sounds like you're trying to talk things out but the communication on one or both sides just isn't going well. Sometimes just having a neutral third party to mediate can make a world of difference and help you both learn how to express yourselves more clearly and to truly hear each other without the emotional lenses in place from prior arguments.
Hope this helps‚ô•Ô∏è
This is really upsetting to hear. 
Personally if I got invited on a trip where trans people are hated and criminalized I would not want to go either. I‚Äôd be so scared for my safety. And even if I weren‚Äôt attacked or had rude comments and stares, I‚Äôd still feel so out of place and anxious anyways. 
So honestly you‚Äôre the rational one here. She as your girlfriend should be a lot more empathetic towards you and your safety and your mental well-being.
Thank you, I feel very lucky to be able to be with an amazing woman who sees love the same way I do. I wish real healthy relationships could be portrayed more often in the media so people wouldn't have to feel like it's normal to be treated like something is wrong with them for being themselves.
For real. I go out of my way to affirm my fianc√©e and help her feel fem. I even paint her nails and do her hair for her. Hearing how you got treated really irks me.
I understand what you‚Äôre getting at, and I also suppose I didn‚Äôt phrase things all that well. I consider there to be different forms of empathy‚Ä¶ I have a friend with ASPD who may not *feel* empathy the same way but has clearly learned to how to *show* it; they have morals and care about justice for the oppressed in this world. However, there *are* people who simply will never change for the better. I know some people who are that self centered and stubborn, and a therapist or psychologist can‚Äôt make someone change unless they want to change (saying this as someone whose parents are psychologists/former therapists). Also, while I agree that breaking up isn‚Äôt always the first thing people should jump to, OP‚Äôs relationship is clearly causing him severe distress so he should at the least remove her from his life for his own good for the time being. Addiction, despite being hard have a partner going through it is a disease and I have very severe, treatment-resistant OCD that causes me to be, well, really annoying to people around me, but there‚Äôs a difference between having a partner going through a rough thing like addiction or OCD and a partner being abusive‚Ä¶OP‚Äôs fianc√© is being abusive and OP shouldn‚Äôt have to put up with that abuse. Couples therapy isn‚Äôt even suggested for abusive relationships as it tends to do more harm than good. He won‚Äôt be the one to fix her. He‚Äôs already given her all help she could get for him in this area and now staying is just torturing OP.
It‚Äôs a normal occurrence in my life tbh , I just hope to be better then those who hurt me"	vlmr0f	trans	870	0.98	2022-06-27 04:15:34
I hate being fucking trans there‚Äôs nothing good about it the amount of dysphoria i get from this shit is insane all my friends are mad atme for not coming to school and shit and they try to relate their self to me they dont understand my dysphoria being trans sucks and having the cycle is even worse		"Whenever I feel shit about being trans I like to look at r/transtimelines to just remember that there is hope for the future
It really gets better, I promise. The dysphoric days gradually fade away and we become more comfortable in ourselves, I think the true end goal is to just not give a fuck what anybody else thinks and feel comfort in knowing you‚Äôre strong for even going through with transitioning. Message me if you want any advice or just a chat.
I'd do anything to be cis. I don't care if cis man or cis women, just cis
I don't think anyone really likes it tbh i also hate it i wish I could just be happy with what I have. But i can't so we have to make the best of it because it won't go away no matter what I do.
it gets better , sending love
Welcome to being an oppressed minority. It sucks, but it does get better. Building community is the first step. I think a lot of young adult trans people make the mistake of resenting their cis friends for not knowing *exactly* how you want to be talked about/treated etc right off the bat. If people are trying their best, it's because they care about you. Let them.
do you wanna be friends?
Oh god‚Ä¶ it gets better!!! You‚Äôre still so young I promise you once you‚Äôre out of school the problems that seemed like the end of the world are going to be non existent
being trans is very painful, but you get to create yourself everyday in a way cis people can't. when you are young and trans there's an extra added feeling of a lack of control. i remember seeing a youtuber talk about ""what to do before hormones"" and he said to document everything, because you're going to want to look back on it one day. i started recording myself and keeping a journal and he was right, i wish i recorded more of my process even. you trick your brain into treating it like a journey. just know some day you are going to look back at this pain and be so proud of yourself that you kept going.
Everything will brighten up my friend. Trans men/masc having cycles sucks badly, and as a trans woman who doesn't have one, I can't relate well enough as I'm starting to experience the cycle, just without blood. Everything will get better and your friends needs to understand more that sometimes we aren't meant to understand, only accept these for who they are and be there for them. 

Hang in there
I have this when i look at my (cis) boyfriend. As a trans man looking at the way his body is sculpted when he‚Äôs naked can sometimes be painful. I keep thinking to myself how i will never be able to look like that and how much i hate my own body. Or sometimes when he steals my clothes and my pants sit just right on his hips, like the way i wish pants looked on me‚Ä¶ I love looking at him because he‚Äôs the most gorgeous human I‚Äôve ever seen but sometimes the voices in my head get too loud. I keep trying to tell myself that it will get better but right now the 5k fee for the top surgery feels unreachable.. 
Anyway the point is, you‚Äôre not alone. I know that‚Äôs not much help but I definitely feel and share your pain.
Those people don't sound like healthy friends, ur issues are real and u deserve to feel like that x
Yeah I feel you on that. This fucking sucks.
I don't want to invalidate your feelings at all, but back when I still had periods I basically was miserable the whole time, and my dysphoria was through the roof. If you decide you wanna do testosterone, it frequently stops your cycle entirely after some time, but even if you don't wanna do t, there's other options for stopping menstruation. Good luck! Getting through my period was always the worst part of being trans for me. üíïüíïüíïüíï
Not being happy with the body we are given is a universal human experience. It's up to you to make it one that suits your tastes.
I feel this 
I‚Äôm almost two years on hormones and 4 months post top and I still fucking hate this every day
I used to hate myself for being trans because of how I felt people treated around me, but after a long while of working on my self and surrounding myself with good people who accept me, I can say that it's something that I embrace and love about myself now <3 Just know you aren't alone and there is hope, stay strong and persevere!
[deleted]
Good until I started looking like me on the inside. Now the most dysphoria I feel is genital and even that's on and off
One of the few positive things Ive found about transitioning at 39 is that my give a damn level is so low it doesn't matter. There has been no better time to come out than now, 20 years ago it was brutal, partially why I kept stepping to the edge and backing off. You are incredibly young, you dont see it yet, but you will. Your older self will thank you for doing what you are doing now instead of waiting till the wrong hormones wreck havoc on your body. 

One day at a time. Keep up with your hobbies, the distraction is very useful. You will make it. I know everyone's experiences are very different but I look back and realize if I can make it through 2 tours in the sandbox, I can make it through this. School is just as brutal, especially with what you are going through right now. Kids are terrible but sleep well knowing that when they get older they will absolutely remember how shitty they were to you. I remember every single time I was an asshole to classmates.

I don't have much useful advise but visualizing where I'm going to be in 2 years gives me hope for the future. That and I do look forward to being a hot chick ripping around town in my DeLorean.
I feel you and I'm sorry that it's hard right now but soon the cycle will stop, you'll be on T and it'll be good. I send hugs
Thank you bro
Underrated coping mechanism
This page is wonderful and helped my egg crack tbh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I still look at it all the time
I don't see any trans men on there after scrolling for a little... So for me not so much..
R/transtimelines honestly makes me more dysphoric. Reminds me of what I'll never be able to achieve
I fucking love being trans, I am special, I belong to a group of lovely people like yourself, and I'll gladly try to be trans in public to inspire and annoy!

You got this, read, learn, if your friends don't like you, fuck em
I don't exactly love being trans, but you gotta learn how to speak for yourself. I know many people who love being gender queer.
Good Attitude goes a long way
Thank you
ü§ù
Tyyyyy
I started progesterone 2/22/22 and i think my biggest mistake was thinking it would work immediately but in 5 months im starting t but its really hard to handle all this dysphoria
I don't think telling someone to get over it helps with anything.
r/thanksimcured
Don't do that don't say shit like that it's so incredibly invalidating
You got this bro, chin up.

Also, you got on T on 2/2/22? Nice!
Being trans is nothing special. We‚Äôre all just normal people. We can be awesome, we can be shitty. We‚Äôre not any different than cis people.
message me anytime! i totally feel your pain and spent many years trying to figure out how to explain this feeling to my parents (which really i still haven‚Äôt been able to and i‚Äôm 21 now) but i had a really hard time as a teenager and i didn‚Äôt think i would ever make it to 18, and once i did i didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôd get this far. but my 21st birthday came and this year i‚Äôll finally have enough money to pay for surgery and i‚Äôve finally started making enough money to pay for my hormones. it does get better! i promise it does.
I really wish I could help more, but I'm always available to talk if you need it! I would recommend using all your euphoria-boosting stuff right now when it's hardest: favorite clothes, underwear, binder, packer, ect. Take good care of yourself with favorite drinks and foods, too! Surround yourself with any people you have in your life that make you feel valid!
I made the same mistake and even after six months it's still happening and I don't know what to do
Can be , my bad - just want op to be alright with himself
I got on hormone blockers 2/22/22 im getting on t in 5 monthsüòéüí™
I think being trans is a very special experience not everyone gets to have. Some people hate that they have it, especially with all the discrimination. But a lot of cultures held gender queer people in a special place in society, and many of us have a unique connection to gender and our bodies we wouldn't have if we were cis. Most people have a certain trait that makes them special in *some* sense. Being an artist is special. Or a musician. Or a doctor and such. I don't like how special is automatically associated with attention seeking or something. It can mean better/greater than, or it can just mean different in a positive light. Nothings wrong with that
Nah person, no not at all. You keep that one to yourself, because no. Someone who fought the tides to become themselves, who did the self reflection, who fought their personal battles, no, that's fucking special.

You never have to agree with another soul on this planet, but no, I am not ""not any different"" than cis people, than allies, than other trans or whatever people.

You exist here for about 12 minutes or whatever in the cosmic sense, make it fucking special.
Tyy
A large majority of people never self reflect or look deep inside to discover who they truly are, I agree that is special."	t5v7ss	trans	824	0.97	2022-03-03 16:19:42
Pov: Cis people	"My aunt saw someone who I knew was transfemme and previously non-binary, and she was like, ""He started showing his gay side more recently in the past few years."" I got mad that she assumed this transfemme person was gay, so I stood up for her and said that she actually transitioned. Then my aunt was like, ""Oh, so she's one of those transformers. I don't know why people pretend to be something they're not, but if they keep at it there's nothing that can really be done.""

She. Was. My. Favorite. Aunt.


And I'm confused because she literally responded: ""What a beautiful story."" When my mom sent her a transmasc story.

Needless to say she is not really my favorite aunt anymore, until further notice.

Idk what's up with the cis these days but if they just mind their own business and do as told, ex: use she/her on a transfemme, everything would be 100% better."	"if she's someone you're close to, it may be worth giving her a little pushback. remind her what century she's in, try the ""how would you feel if everyone called you a boy?"" hypothetical, etc. if it's not safe don't worry about it, but i understand how hurtful it is to hear a relative you love say nasty shit
Omg, I am a transformer!

In all seriousness, some people are just way too out there. For example, my mother is only okay with being trans if it makes you straight. (Plot twist, I'm trans-masc and only attracted to guys)

This is the same person who opposes gay marriage because ""women naturally like women more, and men naturally like men more because they have more in common... So of gay marriage was allowed the human race would die out!""
Yeah, cis people generally don't develop their understanding of gender after like 6 years old.
>Oh, so she's one of those transformers.

More than meets the eye!
It's a lame feeling when someone you love basically becomes emotionally 'dead' to you right before your eyes. They're right there, but you can never look at, or feel about, them the same way again.
I hear you, it's a never-ending battle. Cis people can be ignorant. I'm cis with a trans spouse - I'm fully aware of the miles I still have to walk to understand what my partner is experiencing. I'm one of the lucky few who has a partner that's patient enough to help me learn.

>Idk what's up with the cis these days but if they just mind their own business and do as told

The thing is, I hear that same sentiment from hateful/willfully ignorant cis het people about the LGBTQ+ community. If we would just stay in our lane and do as told, everything would be fine for them. 

They don't want to learn and we don't want to have to teach them. We shouldn't have to teach them acceptance, true. But then how will anything ever get better for anyone if we go around in circles laying the blame on each other? Expecting the opposing party to ""just deal with it"" whether it's homophobia or a transition?

I agree with you. When my mother spews ignorant words that are hurtful to me or my wife, I get upset too. The woman seriously thinks she's an ally but her words don't match the idea in her head. It's infuriating but I will never stop calling her out or shining light on what she just said, because if I did, she might go on insulting people in the world who *don't love her as much as I do*.
I still don't understand why people are always like ""your pretending to be someone your not"" when in reality were acting more like who we are plus why do people even hate us we did absolutely nothing to them
Man. I WISH I was a transformer.
Well she‚Äôs wrong we aren‚Äôt pretending I‚Äôm trans and I always known I was a girl. Trans ppl always know they are trans, we aren‚Äôt transformers maybe she should learn that gay and trans ppl aren‚Äôt the same and that there is a difference but sweetie im really sorry about your friend.
I can get so annoyed with cis people it‚Äôs crazy how quick people will show their true colors once they know you are trans
üò≥

*Sigh*
Well, to play devil‚Äôs advocate, changing one‚Äôs ideology over night isn‚Äôt easy. It‚Äôs always a process, and it can take years (especially for older folks) to understand that just because one thing *was* a certain way, that doesnt mean it *is* or has to be now.
While I can understand it must have been upsetting to have someone you once held in very high regard make ignorant comments that upset you.. openly bashing all cis people, regardless if they are LGBTQ or are supportive of those in that community, based on the comments/actions of one particularly ignorant person doesn't sound much better
Feels more like a problem with your aunt or the cis people you know than cis people in general ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Sounds like someone got to her with some propaganda. Maybe too much time on facebook
I feel this... I'm very tempted once I'm able to come out to just disappear from my whole family for a few years but stalk on Facebook maybe keep in touch with one of my brothers kids because they seem better than everyone else and find out when the next family reunion is so I can show up and be like ""yeah I'm (moms name)'s daughter. Got a problem with it go fuck yourself""
They just don‚Äôt get it as a straight cis man open to dating trans women if my parents got a hold of that information they would think I am their word not mine a homosexual which is inaccurate yet that too would be OK too
I love it when people say ‚Äútransformers‚Äù like yes I can turn from a human to a robot
I wish I was a transformer. Woop woman, woop man! Instantly ü¶æ

Me gender fluid üòâ! ( having a very difficult time with myself now) 

Sorry for losing a fav ant. And maybe ask her to join this century could help. 

Also what is transfemme?

( English is not my first language)
So she‚Äôs sexist? Because a trans man is brave but a trans woman is ‚Äúpretending to be something they‚Äôre not‚Äù
no fr. cis people just won‚Äôt let trans people exist in comfort and safety. they feel the need to fight trans people tooth and nail on everything. cis people are getting more ignorant by the day it‚Äôs ridiculous. i do thank the cis and/or hetero people who are supportive :)
Send her the book ""Whipping Girl"" by Julia Serano! It will explain in no uncertain terms exactly why this kind of mindset is destructive to all women.
Yeah, depending on the situation I would try to educate her. But obviously the original poster knows her better. It shouldn‚Äôt be required to of course, but that‚Äôs what I would personally try to do. (if it‚Äôs safe and they have the mental energy for it and what not)
>For example, my mother is only okay with being trans if it makes you straight. (Plot twist, I'm trans-masc and only attracted to guys)

lol my mom said I can't be bi if I'm trans and that I can only like one gender
that‚Äôs the gayest thing i‚Äôve ever heard
Transformers! Robots with pride!
Honestly kids are actually better at it, I'm 22 and when I told my 13 year old sister she took to it almost right away, other adults it's like a 50 50 split.
You mean bigots don't.
and in some cases they never do!!
As a cis guy I listen to my trans friends when it comes to gender and gender identity, a majority of them understand it a lot more. All I‚Äôll say is my views/understanding of gender definitely changed and I managed to change my parents views so I guess I‚Äôm part of the cool people club
Thank you for this!
Yeah, right. So easy. Turn in to what ever üòä you feel
 at the moment.
>Trans ppl always know they are trans,

Not always. Sometimes it takes decades for the egg to crack.
frrr, the other day my friend met a trans person (who is my friend) and as soon as they left, i got a gazillion questions like ""are they a girl? is he a he? or a she? or a they? or what??? or a guy who wants to be a girl because idk how i feel about that"". safe to say theyre no longer my friend (im litrually trans myself) but it was just so bizarre because i didnt know they were like that,,, but i guess thats cis people for you.
Nah this is like a ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù statement. Yes, we get it, not all cis but this is a safe space to vent about trans experiences and sometimes that includes ignorance or hateful cis people bashing.

If you‚Äôre cis and you‚Äôre upset, work to be better. If you‚Äôre not upset, good and keep scrolling. 

Not saying any of this abrasively and am not ‚Äúcoming for you‚Äù, just saying.
I understand, maybe I should've worded the title a little better.
I am going to assume this wasn‚Äôt intentional, but this response comes off as self righteous. 

This is like a man responding to someone who is complaining about men based on the misogyny they‚Äôve experienced, with the response ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù
Googled transfemme. üòâ Yup also me üòÅ. But not quite comfortable yet to go out, I was, but somehow I became a bit worried if it is really me. And stopped almost completely being femme in expression. Stupid, really, the hole day I dream of looking not the way I look ( amab).

Just scared to lose the love of my life. üò¢
The weird things they come up with are just so wild!
Right? That was the day I discovered my mother was so deep in the closet she discovered Narnia.
Yep thats part of what good allies do. Be accepting and help other people be accepting.

Thank you <3
Your right I‚Äôm sorry
I would add ""if you are upset because you are not like that, realize that isnt about you""

There are so many cis people (speaking absolute terms here, not relative) who are ignorant so we need to vent. Even if 99% of humanity were accepting, that would leave 70 million who are not. Thats like a full country of people who hate us. And we are nowhere close to 99% acceptance. 

So we need to vent about the bad ones. The op made it clear this is about the aunt as an example for ignorant cis people. If you are cis and not ignorant that statement is not about you.
Yeah these responses help no one, people need to stop protecting cis feelings like transphobia from cis people is not an EXTREMELY common, often daily occurrence for many of us.
It's just a vent, you're absolutely entitled to it!
Yeah, that honestly has the same vibe as like, ""Every guy wants to be a woman!  You just ignore it for a few years and then it goes away!""

Really seems like a ton of people from pre-Millenial generations are closeted so hard it circles around and becomes a secret to only them.
I do my best to be a good ally, my gf is trans and I just want to do my best to understand her and stuff. There‚Äôs also the fact that a lot of my close friends are trans and I want to be able to understand and help and whatnot. I was influenced by an old friend into transphobic beliefs and stuff but I learned to become accepting once I dropped him as a friend and started making friends with trans people which made me realise how wrong I was"	wjj1b6	trans	762	0.98	2022-08-08 20:20:34
Parents mad at my trans sister for not dressing up in pool clothes	"Im not trans but I have a younger sister who recently came out as trans. I support her and have a good relationship with her but she feels misunderstood by our parents. Today we were planning on going to the pool. I know that my sister is quite insecure about her body and wears long sleeved clothes. She insisted on wearing a long sleeve sweater and jeans and asked if she could go to the park thats right next to the pool. My parents got very mad at her and i suggested that it could be because of her gender dysphoria. The problem is that my parents, especially my dad, doesnt like it when i intervene on behalf of my sister whenever this issue comes up. My dad is in his 60s and he is progressive for his age and the people he grew up with but hes still a little ignorant when it comes to these things. How can i help my sister with this in the future without having to make anyone upset?

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice yall, i cant thank you enough. I am kind of treading on thin ice rn because standing up for my sister could mean me and maybe even her getting punished. theyre already not happy with us and im worried if my sister makes my dad more upset she will get sent to military school, and my dad intends on making her spend the full 4 years pretending to be a boy there. im scared for her. I am willing to push my dad for my sister but i cannot get me or her hurt just because i wanna act heroic. If i act too much im gonna come full circle and might make her look bad so shell be put in that school"	"Just stay supportive of yoru sister and let keep patiently explaining to your parents why she feels the way she does. From your post it seems like they hurt her out of ignorance rather than malice, which means they just need to learn and improve.

Your parents need to realize that you're not ""intervening"", you're just trying to help them understand.
I don‚Äôt have any real great advice, just wanted to say that your sister is lucky to have you for a sibling!  Keep standing up for her when you need to, try to be as patient and calm with your parents as you can, and hopefully they‚Äôll start to get it and come around.
I understand her plight only too well. I use a long sleeve swim shirt and a big floppy hat and sunglasses and huge man trunks to hide my currently transitioning body from the community. I live in Florida and don't need the hate in my life. I told people I have a NON infectious skin condition I have to put cream on for and it can't be in sunlight or have sunscreen on it so I have to stay covered up. I get in the pool and I do exercises and run as fast as i can doing laps. It's a great workout and people leave me alone.

If she does something like this she can still be with the family, which is all your Dad really wants, is for you all to do something fun together because time goes by fast and soon there will be no more family time.

You are a good brother keep sticking up for your sister, that's what family does. Dad will come around don't give up on him either. Love to you both.
Not every girl has a sister like you, I sure wish I do. Keep supporting her no matter what. I cannot put in words how much I appreciate what you‚Äôre doing! Thank you!
>he is progressive for his age

Yet he got angry at your sister for something literally beyond her control.... yeah he sounds lovely.
The fact your parents go as far as punishing you for helping to support your sister is a major red flag. Reminds me of companies that punish/fire workers for trying to unionize.

You're absolutely doing the right thing by defending your sister. If you want to escape trouble maybe you could talk to your sister in cases like these and be the one to suggest stuff instead of her? For example if you're the one to suggest going to the park then you're not defending her, she's just tagging along.

That said, some things are worth doing, even (maybe in this case *especially*) if your parents disprove. Stay strong <3
You are a hero. What your doing for your sister may be causing you to suffer consequences with your parents, but you are a hero for standing up for her. Most of all, your her hero.

Every trans person would be thrilled with someone like you as a sibling. We need more people like you.

It may suck now, having to deal with these consequences, but it will pay off. Your sister will remember and in the future when your not under the thumb of your parents, you'll appreciate going through the punishments because you are doing the right thing.

Thank for being an amazing ally and being there for your sister. We appreciate you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
You're the older sibling, It's on you to protect your sister, even from your parents.  sometimes people have to get upset.
Mmmm.

Your parents punish you and sometimes ""get violent"" for... wh -- caring about your sister's well-being?  Isn't that something they want you to do?

Unless it interferes with their *authority,* I suppose.

So I'm a trans woman and I still hate swimming in public pools.  I don't like the way the wet clothes stick to my body and literally *show* people that I'm trans.  So yeah, I imagine you're right about that being the problem.
Oh honey, that edit? You dad isn‚Äôt progressive at all.
Your doing more then you no sweety that fucking amazing keep it up üòä
Unfortunately you can't make everyone happy. But i bet you make your sister feel supported and she's going to need that more than your parents.
There's hundreds of reasons she may not have wanted to wear a swimsuit. What a weird thing for parents to be mad about. 

If she doesn't want to wear a swimsuit then she doesn't have to.
Be positive and encouraging. Never make the experiences negative, especially if she takes a chance and then gets cold feet. Let her just ease into it on her own but also gentle nudging can go a long way.
Without having to make anyone upset. That‚Äôs the rock you will trip on forever. Drop the idea that you can fight for something, stand up for someone or yourself and make everyone happy in the process. Get comfortable at making people uncomfortable if you wanna voice your opinions and really uncomfortable if you want those opinions to be taken seriously and super uncomfortable if you want action to follow your opinions.
continue to be her advocate to your parents until she can find the strength to advocate for herself. show her how it's done!!
Honestly the pool is lame af (I can‚Äôt swim üíÄ)
This shit breaks my heart.. I am so sorry. No kid should be burdened with having to protect their sibling from their parent.

You are a good sibling, and she sounds lucky to have you. If you have someone you can trust.. teacher.. counselor.. an adult you trust, maybe try reaching out to them. Your father sounds abusive from your further comments.  This situation goes beyond what anyone here can help with, beyond offering support and stuff.

Please stay safe, and save all the money you can so you can GTFO and get your sister out too. Once you are an adult there is nothing he can do
Well the military in the end will help with any kind of medical she my need and otherwise couldn't afford
How old is your sister?
My advice is to be aware of when giving advice, even when well-intentioned, would cause your parents to double down. You mentioned in your post that your dad does not respond well to interventions on your part. My family's like this too - sometimes they feel on the defensive when another actor comes into a conversation between two people. 

You seem like a really great sibling and your sister is lucky to have you. But if your advice is harming more than it's helping, perhaps you should consider leaving the issue between your parents and your sister. 

My guess is they will respond better when she defends herself instead of having you intervene. You obviously know your family better than me though, so take it or leave it.
I think you should show your dad this post. Maybe print it out and leave it for him where he gets ready in the morning. Any rational human would get feels from this.
Just keep loving her, let her know that you are always there for her, and support her and that she can always talk to you, and that will be enough support for now. When you're older and can have your own place, maybe then you both can stay together. This is the way.
How does your sister feel about the situation and what your role should be?  You should speak with her privately so you understand what she wants before taking any action on her behalf.  

Either way, I am sure she is grateful for your support.  No matter what happens - be the brother that she needs.  It sounds like you are already well on your way.  I wish I had support like you are giving her.
Keep defending your sister. You have no idea what that means to her. One of my sisters is my biggest supporter, and I have never been able to properly convey to her what it means to me. She thinks she‚Äôs gets it. All I can say is your sister will never forget you being there for her. In a world where it can feel like everyone is against you as a trans person you may very well be the only thing that feels good to her. Keep being there. You‚Äôre amazing. My love to you üíú
Thanks for being a supportive sibling!
I want to share something it took me decades in therapy to really understand: The things your parents do to your sister and you are not your fault or hers. Even when they frame it as a response to your behavior, they are adults with the positive duty to raise you as free from fear, coercion and danger as possible. A Cis man who even threatens to force his Trans daughter to attend military school as a boy is an abuser, even if he's ""progressive"" in many ways. And if you face punishment for sticking up for her, that's another red flag. Take it from someone who had emotionally abusive parents & spent decades in therapy overcoming it.

Seek IRL help and guidance if there is a supportive adult in your life that you can trust to discuss these things with who will not report what you say to your parents (especially your father) & to whom your sister is comfortable coming out. If there is no such adult, do your best to find one and get their input. These are problems no kid should have to deal with, and I am sorry you and your sister have to. 

PS - I also want to mention how lucky your sister is to have you. Continue giving her the love and support you already are.
Slightly off topic, but! I am a cis woman with a real (non infectious) skin disease very similar to what you are claiming! It's called dermatomyositis, I won't get into all the details, but basically I HAVE to stay out of the sun as much as possible and if I am in the sun for any period of time I have to wear mineral sunscreen. I also have steroid cream I use occasionally if I have a flare up, which is kinda like an itchy sunburn that doesn't go away normally.
Anyway, I just thought it might be helpful for you to know that a disease like this does exist, so if anyone ever challenges you on it you can give them something to chew on.
When they get upset i get punished and yelled at for it.
ice cold take there. it is NEVER a child's responsibility to protect their siblings from abusive parents.
14
aww I'm so sorry you have to endure this. I hope there is relief for you from this condition. Thanks for the info, I'd hate to claim I had something wrong with me that I didn't, weird karma or something, so I'm just saying I have a condition (never saying if it is medical or just mental or imagined) and I let them make up whatever narrative they want in their own heads. I don't think I could remember the name of it either! I have other conditions I can't remember the name for but that's just getting old. Thanks for taking the time to respond. Great info. Much love.
as fucked as it is you are protecting your sister and she will thank you for it far into adulthood. your parents are in the wrong and you do have the choice to not take on their shit and it wouldn‚Äôt be your fault that it then went back to her but i think your little sister has already greatly benefited from knowing there is someone in the home who understands her and is willing to fight for what she deserves
That's life dude, I'm so sorry you don't have the parents you deserve.
You're doing everything right. Unfortunately your parents are human, they're wrong sometimes. And often when people are wrong they take it poorly.
for sure not their responsibility it‚Äôs not fair or fight but sometimes older siblings do it anyway because they want to protect their younger sibling. sometimes you‚Äôd rather sit there and take it then be in the other room hearing them get treated that way
That's too bad she's so young that she can't just leave.  I'm sorry your parents are behaving that way.  Give your sister hugs from me.
I cant stand up for my sister before my dad becomes very aggressive. If i do anything that he takes personally he will scream and in some cases get violent. Because im a minor im dependent on him and if I do thinks that he does not like that will affect me. He is already considering sending me to a christian private school and my sister to a military school. i see where youre coming from but im not tryna piss my parents off especially when theyre the ones who can subdue me.
üíØagreed
Yeah,but I couldn‚Äôt see my sister get treated like this so at first I would protect and if it isn‚Äôt working I would call the police because I see my sister get treated like that.
my parents tell me she can stand up for herself but shes the sibling who ""behaves the best"" and so she reacts to it in the most passive way possible to not get punished.
Hey I'm really sorry to tell you this, but as someone who witnessed similar things in some of my friends households: this is abuse. Your parents are being abusive. I know the lines can get blurry because you love them and they love you, but that doesn't undo the damage they are inflicting on you and your sister. Feeling afraid of your parents/ being afraid to stand up for yourself or your sibling is not normal. You and your sister need to keep your heads low until you get the chance to move out.

While you may want to protect your sister please keep in mind, that it would be your parents' responsibility to protect the two of you in the first place.

I wish you all the luck and I'm sending you all the love in this world.
If your dad is screaming and getting violent, you need to contact a trusted adult such as a teacher or school counselor and ask for help. Stay safe, OP
This is dreadful. The two of you are captives to his whims, and there is an ongoing threat of exile hanging over your heads.

I have no doubt he thinks he's doing what's best for you two. But that kind of thinking has been a cover for countless historical atrocities. Forcing someone to do what you think is what is best for them never turns out well. And, in my experience, it is very difficult to get through to such a person.

I wish I could give you an escape plan. But it looks to me like you two need to lay low and comfort each other and try not to set him off. I also think, as others have said, that you two should start planning an escape. The sooner the better, but make sure your plan is airtight. These kinds of situations have a way of escalating.
they dont do it to the point where i would have to call the police. i mean they still love us, but my dad doesnt really understand what she is going through. and he has problems of his own. like, alot of problems. he had a really shitty childhood.
i always reacted that way as well when i was in trouble but i was the older sibling. when it comes down to it everyone reacts differently and internalizes things differently. it‚Äôs not your responsibility as the older sibling to protect her from your parents but as someone who internalizes things not having the acceptance of parents is awful, i think as long as you‚Äôre still sticking up for her in private and telling her that they are wrong and she should do what feels right for her you would not be doing anything wrong if you didn‚Äôt take on the responsibility of changing your parents‚Äô mind. it is very healing to have someone stick up for you though so i think what you did with the pool and trying to give your parents some psycho-education was very effective and kind
Oh sorry, my answer wasn‚Äôt really based on your post and more at the context Frontverlauf comments above  talking about its not the siblings responsibility to protect the other sibling from abusive parents 

Sorry"	128rw1e	trans	694	0.98	2023-04-01 16:53:45
I hate her so much	My therapist, I recently just stopped working with her. Because of how horrible she treated me, and targeted me because I am transgender. But I went to look at reviews for her, but now she has on her profile how she works with trans people. And is very affirming and supporting (which is a lie.) I‚Äôve never seen this on her profiles before, this is completely new. I am just so mad and sad at the same time.	"Leave a bad review if you can. Really sorry you were mistreated.
Absolutley scared of turfs like these. they are just leeches on my trust and desire for help.  


You'll find someone. Don't stop feelin good because of one amoral agenda pushing jerk.  


Sendin Love ü§óüòòüòò
My therapist gave up when I wasn't an easy patient anymore. I worked on my bipolar with her for years and I was stable. As soon as I mentioned gender dysphoria she got uncomfortable and asked me to find a new therapist. That was very hard and there was a therapist that I saw that was bad as well. Glad I kept looking because I found the perfect therapist for me.
What did she that was horrible for you ?
I‚Äôm so glad I never had to see a therapist before starting talking to some random about my problems isnt for me
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what did she do that was horrible?
Same thing happened to me a while back. She kept trying to coerce me away from transition (she won because I've given up any hope of it). You're better off without a therapist like that. The positive reviews might be faked, to be honest, uhless the site verifies identities
Get another therapist. She sounds like a wannabe. She‚Äôs definitely mistreating you by the words she‚Äôs using.
Sorry
I'm so sorry you had this experience. Please report her if you can, and I hope you find a better therapist soon!
I can‚Äôt on my main, but I prob will under a throw away or something.
I really hope that you aren't too angry at that therapist still. Therapists have different areas that they focus on and specialize in. She might have been excellent with your bipolar disorder but not having any experience with gender issues so telling you that she's not the one to help guide you through that was very professional of her IMHO. It meant losing you as her client but she's the one that knows the limitations of her knowledge and expertise and she probably saw that you would not be properly served by her at this point. 

I had something not entirely different happen recently. Back in January, I decided that I needed to change therapists so I went back and started looking. I found someone that sounded like a good fit but the first appointment I could get was in April. Meanwhile, I'm going out of my mind with anxiety issues on top of trying to get help transitioning and I find out that my workplace has an employee assistance program that will pay for 10 therapy sessions through a telemedicine service. It's free, I got nothing to lose so I sign up saying thar I'm having issues with anxiety and some other stuff. 

A couple week or so later, I started HRT and my anxiety is just gone. Poof. Overnight practically. 

Get the session with the EAP therapist. Explain that I'd be more than happy to talk about my nonexistent anxiety issues with her. She's taken aback and I go into some detail with my story and that I'm still looking for help with gender and sexuality issues that are present and she tells me that she's very much a specialist in anxiety and really doesn't have experience in the topics that I'm looking for help with at the moment. I thanked her for her time and her honesty with me and we ended the call about 30 mins early.
Bunch of stuff, one is that she looked me dead in the eyes and told me I will never be a man.
https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/sc0lny/tw_is_my_therapist_right/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf that‚Äôs not even all
‚ÄúShe won because I‚Äôve given up any hope of it‚Äù

This statement hits a bit close to home, so I feel I should remind you that you deserve hope as well! Even if you‚Äôve had a particularly horrible experience with therapy, please try your best to keep an open mind towards your own happiness and remember that anyone worth a dang will support you to achieve it! As hard as it is to stay positive sometimes, nobody deserves to have their hopes stripped from them because of the ignorance of others, you, all of us, owe it to ourselves to keep moving ahead as best we can! Sometimes that‚Äôs therapy and sometimes it‚Äôs just goofing around on trans subreddits, but it‚Äôs important to keep hope alive in whatever way works best, right?
I wonder if she can just delete bad reviews, is it on her website or something like Facebook? It‚Äôs obviously not going to be Tripadviser, maybe there should be a therapy advisor site for honest reviews that can‚Äôt just be hidden
Thank you so much for your comment


I'm not mad at her, I appreciate her telling me that she wasn't best equipped for my issues. 
I did feel betrayed at the time because she was the first person I ever talked to about my gender dysphoria. But in hindsight I'm so glad that I could find a new therapist.

She was the only therapist I'd ever had so I didn't know if she was good or not, but my new therapist is also way better with my bipolar too. The first one was a lot older and not up to date with the latest research (literally pulled out the DSM5 and said maybe I'm a transsexual or a crossdresser). My current therpist is much more engaging  which is a super important trait, and reads research between sessions. She also recommends papers for me to read because I'm very academicly minded.
How did you felt hearing her saying that ?
It‚Äôs on one of those therapist finder websites.
Really glad to hear that things are working better with your new therapist and that you appreciate her for being honest with you! It may have taken some time for that and that's also understandable, especially since you'd been working with her for a long time on your bipolar."	u8fh2d	trans	702	0.98	2022-04-21 04:42:59
[Update Post] I did it. I went to Easter as myself, and it was extremely awkward.	"So I made a [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/u3nlej/need_a_second_opinion_would_i_be_in_the_wrong_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) the other day asking for advice on whether it would be wrong for me to dress appropriately to my gender when my father asked me not to when coming to family events. Well I did it, and oh boy was it awkward. 

So to begin, everyone is already there. I‚Äôm the last to show up. I ring the doorbell and my mom answers. I smile as much as I can for a nervous wreck and proceed to tell her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so fucked :)‚Äù She steps outside for a moment to talk to me and my sister peeks around the corner and comes out with her. She asks what I want to do and I just said fuck it and said I‚Äôll just go in. So my mom goes in and I give my sister a big hug before I go in.

Aaaand let the awkward begin. I walk in and before anything happens my mom apparently went and found my dad and told him before I came in (I guess to give him some warning). Well I walk in and my dad walks around the corner, barely glances at me, and keeps walking right out the front door. Not saying a single word to me. No ‚ÄúHello‚Äù no ‚ÄúI told you not to blah blah blah..‚Äù Oh. Yeah. He‚Äôs definitely pissed. 

Well I walk into the kitchen where everyone is waiting and my grandparents look at both my friend and I and they recognize my friend from last Easter and say hello to him. My grandfather looks at me and says ‚Äúand who could this be?‚Äù At first I thought maybe they genuinely didn‚Äôt know, but then my grandma responded to his question with ‚ÄúI have no idea who this is‚Äù. Yeah no, they know it‚Äôs me. That was it. That was the only thing my grandparents said to me for the entire time I was there. After my dad comes back in we proceeded to grab food that my mom cooked and eat. I eat in the living room with my Mom, my sister, and my friend. My dad and my grandparents ate separately in the kitchen. I had asked my mom and apparently she told them I was trans the week before because ‚ÄúShe had a feeling I was going to do this.‚Äù I can‚Äôt be mad at her honestly it‚Äôs kind of a relief‚Ä¶

Well THEN after food, my grandfather goes missing. My dad and grandma goes to look for him and go out front. My grandma then comes back in, grabs some paper towels, says he was out front in the car, and then goes back out. Ok he‚Äôs obviously out there crying. Now I feel bad. We‚Äôre all kind of sitting there awkwardly talking then they all come back in sniffling. 

THIS is where it starts to get even more awkward they were throwing me a surprise birthday because it was my birthday a couple weeks before. THAT SHIT was awkward for EVERYONE. My mom carried out a cake with candles and maybe half of the people sang happy birthday, and half assed at that. Nothing is more awkward than a half assed birthday song. ‚ÄúHappy birthday to you.. happy birthday dear.. muehuhhhe????‚Ä¶..‚Äù THEY DIDNT SAY EITHER NAME. THEY JUST PAUSED AWKWARDLY FOR LIKE 5 SECONDS. 

Well after that everyone went back to talking separately, my dad and his parents, and everyone else. At the end neither my dad nor my grandpa said bye to me. Surprisingly my grandma did. She did hug me and say she loved me and bye. But my grandpa and my dad said nothing.

TLDR; I went to Easter as myself, made my grandpa cry, and got sung an awkward happy late birthday. 

I can only hope that things hopefully get less awkward :)"	"This was a HUGE step forward! I really hope you can see that and maybe feel a bit of pride despite how poorly it went. 

I promise you it gets easier. Like, if you can endure this, you‚Äôre gonna be fine out in the wild üíö
Yeah it was awkward but you ripped off that bandaid and should be proud of yourself. The people who wouldn't accept you standing in the kitchen and eating without chairs is kinda funny. Their loss.
You were soooo brave. Very well done ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Okay, first off, wow. Just wow. I am so impressed by your courage to do that! ‚ù§Ô∏è I was following your prior post and saw this follow up! Seriously, girl, I am so beyond proud of you. You did you, you were yourself unapologetically and with respect for those around you. And that is classy üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

*btw, I‚Äôm really sorry it was as amazingly awkward as it was, but hey, you‚Äôre totally right! This was a great step forward and a huge win! You gotta celebrate girl!
Good job! Your brave, and I'm so impressed!

That birthday scene needs to be made into a scene on YouTube. The awkwardness is unreal, but you made it through that!
>My grandfather looks at me and says ‚Äúand who could this be?‚Äù At first I thought maybe they genuinely didn‚Äôt know, but then my grandma responded to his question with ‚ÄúI have no idea who this is‚Äù

You sure this wasn't a really awkward way to ask you to introduce yourself with your chosen name? Especially with you grandma hugging and saying she loved you. Even you grandpa crying implies that he cares about you. 

I'm very socially awkward and I could easily see myself doing that. Especially if they knew you had waited a lot before coming out they might not have wanted to bring up the conversation and instead wait for you to do it. 

At the very least neither of them reacted badly so that's a start.
That‚Äôs insanely brave of you. I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to do this. Right on!
i‚Äôm so proud of you! i‚Äôm glad things went the way the way they did, i was actually worried abt this whole event after reading the first post.
Congrats to you! 

Honestly, the fact that you went and stayed the entire time says wonders about you and I think is actually a really positive sign about the potential for the rest of your family to accept you. Sure, it was super awkward, but you were safe, you were yourself, and everyone even sang you (what sounds like the absolute most cringeworthy version ever of) Happy Birthday. 

In my experience, even people who are unkind early in transition are often pretty accepting later on. I had a colleague who was pretty unkind to me tell me that he had never met a trans person before, and he's pretty ok at this point. You did the hardest part already. And I agree with what others have said: it's going to get much easier. üíúüíúüíú
You didn‚Äôt make your grandpa cry. You are not responsible for any reactions other than your own. Your grandpa could‚Äôve been reminded of an old friend or a time when he got beat for trying on his mother‚Äôs clothes. Or a hobby he loved but had to give up bc it wasn‚Äôt manly. Even if he claimed his reaction was all about you, rest assured that it wasn‚Äôt. your dad had time to influence your grandparents and even then they weren‚Äôt that shitty. Also you might want to communicate directly w your grandparents and dad and say the words you mean and how you want to be addressed. Your mom didn‚Äôt know not to come out for you so she probably didn‚Äôt word it right. It would be good to catch that right away so they don‚Äôt start bad habits. You could rehearse it and maybe even write it down so they can remember better. Like on a cute notecard with a new pic of you. Congrats! I bet you feel a lot lighter now.
1stly: WTF
2ndly: you are so goddamn brave!! üëçüëçüí™üí™
I'm sorry, the idea of them just completely stopping and not saying either name is hilarious to me. 

Anyway, glad you were able to go to a family thing without anything breaking or a verbal fight.
Hey congrats girl! Give them time, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll come around. Hell, they‚Äôve thrown a surprise birthday party for you after all that. They certainly care about you üòä
Oh my god, this was painful to read so I can't even imagine actually living it! You did great OP, well done. Seems promising that your grandma said goodbye at least and that no one actually left before the end.
I shit myself when I think of doing something like this, I‚Äôm very proud of you, keep flourishing!!
This took so much courage, glad you are finally getting to be yourself! Sorry it was so awkward :/ hopefully your father and grandfather come around, happy early birthday also!
[deleted]
Aww, I'm proud of you girl! That's a big step and i can't even imagine doing that with my family
oh my gosh! you did so well. I'm so proud of you.
Honestly despite possibly never being invited again, I feel accomplished. Me four years ago would‚Äôve shit my pants thinking of doing what I just did üòÖ

Makes me kinda proud of myself :)
They didn‚Äôt eat without chairs (though that isn‚Äôt really important) the rest of us just ate in the living room. It was just awkward because the whole time they didn‚Äôt really talk to me. But maybe they‚Äôll come around :) also yeah ripping the bandage off hard is less painful than the dread of keeping it on for sure!
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 

I tried my best to be as brave as I could, I even smiled the whole time so if someone happened to stop ignoring me for 3 seconds they‚Äôd see I was happy :)
Thank you :) I don‚Äôt know how I did it, honestly I was extremely terrified. I‚Äôm still terrified üòÖ but I did it, and I did it with a smile and now I suppose I wait and hope for the best. I feel like I just took a giant leap in my self confidence.

To be honest also one of the main reasons I did it was because I was recently depressed and not presenting even out on my own probably mainly due to being upset over my father not accepting me. The last time we had talked he got angry (which made me kind of angry) and he kicked me out his house. I had lost my spark and I feel like this is honestly what I needed. Super glad and I thank everyone who encouraged me‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Omg seriously like not kidding Top 3 most awkward moments in my life. Like, if I didn‚Äôt know better I‚Äôd think that they were intentionally trying to make it MORE awkward üòÖ
It could be quite possible! Maybe I was also a little at fault for awkwardness because I didn‚Äôt really try to talk to them about it but I also wanted to give them the space they needed to deal with stuff. One thing is for sure I definitely need to call them and talk to them or have a dinner conversation with them about it. They deserve at least that
Brave? Perhaps. But we all have moments of bravery. It‚Äôs brave to accept who you are, it‚Äôs brave to come out to anyone, it‚Äôs brave to wake up every day and keep going. I didn‚Äôt think long ago I‚Äôd ever be able to do something like this but here I am. Who‚Äôs to say you couldn‚Äôt have done it? I believe everyone here has the potential to do the exact same thing. Plus, I probably never would have if I didn‚Äôt have an accepting sister and a really good friend to come with me for support :)
Aw thank you :) I was worried for my mental health. 
For like 3 days I was having nightmares but hey, I‚Äôm perfectly ok!! ^‚Äî^
I never really make a birthday wish before blowing out candles, but this year I didn‚Äôt hesitate to wish inside of my head for my family to eventually accept me while blowing out the candles. Let‚Äôs hope that you‚Äôre right and my birthday wish comes true :)
They already know how I want them to address me. At least my mom and dad do. Not sure about my grandparents I haven‚Äôt talked to them about it. I have hopes that my mom will get there I think that she‚Äôs too afraid to break some sort of imaginary peace barrier between me and everyone else. My dad I don‚Äôt know if he will ever come around from some of the things he‚Äôs said about me being trans. My grandparents I have zero clue. But my grandpa was definitely crying because I‚Äôm trans there is no sugar coating it unfortunately :( I do believe he has a sibling that was trans that they outcasted from the family, or at least so I‚Äôve heard by word of mouth.
All I need now is a bow and a Scottish accent and maybe I can get my own movie! 

No but in all seriousness I don‚Äôt feel brave, I just had a strong desire to be myself and the help of some people and pushed through it! In that sense of like to think we are all \ can all be brave! <3
Oh it was like a scene straight out of a movie. Hopefully it‚Äôll be something to laugh at in years to come üòÖ
Well they kinda knocked out Easter and my birthday in one day. But I mean, they didn‚Äôt expect for me to come as Myself, the expected me to come as deadname (except my mom who suspected I would). But they definitely do care about me. I just hope they care enough to not let their beliefs get in the way of supporting me by actually respecting me enough to use my name and pronouns :) it‚Äôll get there eventually, hopefully.
Yeah! It was painful but it was less painful than pretending I‚Äôm not trans and boy-moding and getting deadnamed. And yeah!! Promising for sure but I definitely thing my dad would‚Äôve left if he wasn‚Äôt in his own house lol
I truly believe the only reason I didn‚Äôt shit myself was because I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything that day 0__0

Also thank you :)
Late birthday!! And thank you! :) ‚ù§Ô∏è hopefully everyone comes around eventually.
It was def awkward! I‚Äôm just glad it wasn‚Äôt emotionally distressful. Like nothing terribly horrible was said to me, at least not to my face. üòÖ
Ahh thank you!!<3 **Hugs**
That's growth, and you should be proud of yourself! Well done!
Any progress is good progress, awkwardness might mean that they‚Äôre having a hard time but are trying! As somebody who enjoys super awkward situations, that birthday singing sounds actually amazing, you should thank the participants for a very memorable birthday üíú
Its like a stab in the gut for me because I know that no matter what, I cant do anything to keep my experience from being like yours. Eventually it will have to happen, that I have to crush others spirits in order to attain my dream.
You should be proud hun!  Huge hugs.  I hope they all take it for struggling through to a better future.  But only time will tell.  I'm glad you were genuine to yourself though!  And I hope they were able to get a glimpse of understanding you better, even if they're having trouble themselves. Hugs again hun and just keep being you and don't let anyone hold you back! <3
YES!
Oh hey, I get that! But girl, you got your spark back!! Congrats again! üôå‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è
>I definitely need to call them and talk to them or have a dinner conversation with them about it.

I wish you luck with that. I hope it goes well.
That‚Äôs a really good point. I‚Äôm generally bold but when it comes to family I‚Äôm very confrontation-avoidant. 

Thankfully my parents just have a more ‚Äúignore it and hopefully it goes away‚Äù approach to my being a daughter instead of a son rather than outright ‚Äúhell no‚Äù attitude so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get the opportunity to test my mettle. They also live 4,000 miles away and I have the advantage of being the oldest and maybe the most ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù (to them) of the kids so it gives me some leeway.

I still think what you did is really cool! So let it be known some random chick in NY thinks you‚Äôre rad!
I'm insanely hopeful for you

And one of the hardest (but also most positive) lessons from being trans is that while everyone isn't accepting, the people who stand by you through everything (like your sister, who sounds great!) are your real family. And you get to choose those people based on what feels right to you. 

I genuinely wish you all the happiness in the world, and that all of your birthday wishes come true!!!
Now that‚Äôs a pro strat right there
Oof sorry totally read that wrong ü•≤üòÖ happy late birthday! Absolutely ‚ù§Ô∏è this is a very inspiring story to me, My father gets married in October and wants me to be his best man‚Ä¶ Ive barely talked to him in years and haven‚Äôt told him about my true self yet, so seeing this really makes me want to ensure I do before I make it a problem on his day.. sorry for the ramble üòÖ once again that took so much courage to do! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Omg hahaha darn I definitely should have invited you then, you would‚Äôve had a field day! 

No but seriously that was my reasoning for doing it, if I don‚Äôt push and let it continue the way it is then nothing will change and I‚Äôll always be deadnamed and nobody will take me seriously :)
Just remember that if spirits are crushed, it‚Äôs not your fault. Stay strong <3 I wish you the best :)
*Hugs*  Thank you<3 I hope one day they can understand and actually take me serious, although I have doubts. But a girl can hope :)
Aww I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs inspiring! Best wishes, I hope the best for your situation! I believe in you :)
Absolutely push for your right to be respected until you‚Äôre comfortable with who you are and how people treat you, that was a big step in that goal for sure and I wish you luck in future steps!"	u6mp4k	trans	687	0.99	2022-04-18 20:28:48

You look great, OP!   
My transition was from giant gym bitch to masculine yoga noodle, I feel like these things really can't be predicted haha
weird question, but where did you get that hat.

RIGHT like I always kinda envisioned myself as a plaid-wearing hairy lumberjack type I guess? üòÇ Because I really wanted a big beard, and I look great in plaid.

Gonna embrace full himbo status üòÜ
Lmao it's the angle. Every time I take full body pics in this mirror it's like a slightly downward angle that make my legs look smaller/shorter than they actually are
Do u lift

dang lol, its right up my boyfriend's alley. he has one with flowers from vans but its only the underside of the brim
As a transfem I can say I'm not jealous of looking masculine but I'm Uber jealous of the results of hrt
I have weights that I try to keep up with but I don't actually go to a gym or anything bc I can't afford a membership rn lmao but I'd like to in the future so I can lift heavier weights than 15lbs and actually gauge how much I can lift
Aw man we need more floral caps üò§

Girlfriend misgenders me and worse..	"We are dating since october from last year, she met me when i was still transitioning(hiding with boymode) and in the first days i told her i am trans and wanted to be treated right with my pronouns and name.
Although... She constantly misgenders me when talking to me or even when talking to friends and such. Doesn't make me that uncomfortable, only makes me insecure about my masculine characteristics.
We were talking about Voice training and how hormone therapy doesn't change the Voice, and i noticed she was curious to hear my old voice so i did it and it surprised her a lot, never did again..
But in recent days, she wanted me to read a ero text using my old voice for some reason, i didn't do It because it was uncomfortable for me but she wanted so bad It made her mad.
One day that we were having an intimate moment, she just whispered me during sex ""i want to hear your real Voice""
I lost It right there and went home, for me i know it's hard to accept me but, it's just too much for me.
Thanks for reading.

Edit:Thank you everyone for the support, i think i made my choice for the better, i really needed to get all of this out of my chest.

Literaly about to cry as i just realized the shit i've been through"	"So your girlfriend disrespects your boundaries, actively does things that trigger your dysphoria, doesn't recognize your gender, and then gets mad at you when you stand up for yourself? Am I reading that right?   

What do you hope to hear from me and this community right now?
If she's not willing to respect who you are, then she's not worth being with in a relationship. If you've told her the things that make you uncomfortable and she refuses to acknowledge that they make you uncomfortable, then she's not worth your time.

If you do break things off with her, I wish you the best with your mental health when going through that.

Things will be okay in time. <3
If she doesn't understand that your real voice isn't the one you were born with, that's a major, MAJOR red flag.
I think she's not your girlfriend, hon... She's your dead name's girlfriend. I know that's hard but you deserve someone who wants YOU and not who they want you to be
She clearly doesn‚Äôt respect you. It‚Äôs a sad thing to say, but you‚Äôd probably be better without her.
I know it's hard to see that someone you love is bad for you, but she clearly doesn't respect you, it appears she wants to slowly force you to detransition by telling you to do things like ""use your real voice"", and misgendering you everytime, probably in hope you are gonna ""go back"" 

I think it's time to end it, she's probably just gonna keep hurting you 

But you'll find someone who loves you for how you truly are, that accepts you and your transness and loves you for it, not and not inspite of it
""real"" voice?? girl i would've lost it then and there. if she wants to date a man she should fuck off and date one, not waste your time and keep triggering you. i'm angry
That's an instant breakup for me.

""How you do anything is how you do everything."" ~ Unknown

A lack of compassion from whatever, be it narcissism, transphobia, jealousy or distain... doesn't matter it's a deal breaker. 

We gotta weed out many people unfortunately so with a tiny dating pool we are expected to date twice as many people than cishet folks just to find someone who isn't queerphobic or hateful??? 

Yea we got the short end... again!
The part about wanting to hear your ‚Äúreal voice‚Äù during sex, which is already way WAY out of line‚Ä¶ I get the impression that she may be fetishizing you. I‚Äôd move on, personally. I like how you seemed to handle these events, and your (hopefully ex) girlfriend doesn‚Äôt seem to be aware enough of your needs. Get ready though, if she‚Äôs as toxic as she sounds, then it‚Äôs probably best to break up over the phone where you can just hang up and block if absolutely necessary. Protect yourself and your mental well-being girl.
There‚Äôs more red flags here than a communist parade. I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with all this. You deserve someone who respects who you are.
Honest opinion ... ditch her. She never respected you from the very beginning and there's no reason to believe she ever will.
Yeah have a talk abt it with her, next time she does smth like this just drop her she's not for you
dump her ass.
Get rid of the whole girlfriend. You deserve to be treated better.
You deserve to be with someone who wants to be with the *real you,* not a role you‚Äôve been forced to play. You are a woman and should be treated and loved as such.
Your girlfriend doesn‚Äôt seem to respect you and honestly doesn‚Äôt seem to view you as a woman. That might change with time but you deserve someone that respects you and your boundaries and that sees you as the person you are. To be honest I think she may have been looking for a feminine man and may not be all that interested in who you are and how you want to live. I really don‚Äôt think this relationship has a future but my opinion on that doesn‚Äôt matter. Talk to her and try and find a way to get this relationship to work for you or find a new one that does.
I have no words. I'm just so fucking sorry and hope that you're able to get out of this toxic situation. You are such a beautiful girl who is worth more than what this shitty person is giving you. <3
It sounds like she really wanted to date the man she thought you were, rather than the woman you are. I don't think that makes her a horrible person, but you definitely aren't the person that's right for her. Hopefully, if she has some growth, she can be friends with you and support you. Attraction is a weird thing, and both people in a relationship not having their needs met causes way more strain than a normal friendship would likely have.
Hun do yourself a favor and dump her IMMEDIATELY!!!!! If she isn‚Äôt going to respect your boundaries and beg you to do something that makes you UNCOMFORTABLE, then that honestly shows how little she seems to care. You deserve better than that, you deserve someone who will love you as you are, respect your boundaries, call you the right pronouns and definitely not beg to hear what she says is your ‚Äúreal‚Äù voice. Also what‚Äôs really funny about that part is your REAL voice is the one you currently have because that‚Äôs the one that fits the REAL you who is the wonderful and beautiful woman that you are transitioning in to. I hope that this helps you in some way and please don‚Äôt stay with someone who is just going to hurt you and make you uncomfortable. Much love to you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Baby, you need to get OUT. You are hurting the both of you by staying together, and you deserve actual love! üíú
Wowy, hell nah.

She could maybe claim confusion at the start but all the things with the voice? That's just a no.

Idk what you need to hear but this isnt it girl.
I'm sorry to hear this sis. She doesn't seem like she wants you to transition. Maybe you could sit down and talk to her. I know it will be hard because you both obviously have an attraction to each other but let her know that you are not at all a man. If she can't respect you for who you are then possibly it's not worth pursuing. I love you!! Message me if you want someone to talk to.üíöüíú‚ù§Ô∏è
She's head fucking you. Get away from her
I was with a boyfriend who had blatantly disrespected my identity and pronouns so much that I ended up in one of the worst depressive pits and tried to un-alive myself. 

If there is anyone in your life who isn‚Äôt supportive it‚Äôs best to cut them out so it doesn‚Äôt lead you down a dark path
For me the misgendering by itself would be enough to break up with her, this is above and beyond
She‚Äôs not a good girlfriend, it‚Äôd be better to drop her. I‚Äôm so sorry that you have to feel like this :(
She doesn‚Äôt sound like a worthwhile person to have in yournlife
Yeah sorry you've had to deal with that. From the sounds of it def doesn't respect your identity. Like I understand if misgendering every so often since for some people it takes adjustments, but when it's very blatant and trying to get you to do stuff that makes you feel uncomfortable then unless they refuse to adjust how they treat you then sadly is best to avoid. I've had to do it to a lot of my family especially on one of my sides that's very right wing. Just hope you're safe and doing well
Maybe she thought she was helping you be okay with your voice? If not then you‚Äôve only described red flags
Screwing up pronouns is one thing, I have ADHD I get it, but all that other stuff is just, ew
End the relationship immediately
girl it seems like you're dating a straight woman. And straight women aren't attracted to other women, they're attracted to men. And although I'm sure your girlfriend does genuinely like you, your girlfriend is attracted to you as a man, so much so that she'd cross your boundaries to see you that way. I'm not gonna go as far as to say break up, but you should at least have a serious talk about this with her and ask her if she is genuinely attracted to you as a man or woman. And then maybe based off of that answer see if you should break it off
Either she knocks this shit off IMMEDIATELY and apologizes, or I would suggest to leave her. It's impossible to be with somebody that doesn't accept you.
She literally started dating you when you were in boy-mode. Stop being so selfish and realize this is hurting her too. You need to break up with her. You were trans and she signed up to be with a boyfriend not a girlfriend ffs.
even if my partner accidentally misgendered that would be a dealbreaker... you deserve better!
Dump her and let her know it's because she is a transphobe.
Get away from her if she don't respect you, she is probably going to keep doing that yk
It's hard to be alone, I can appreciate that, but I think you'll endure even more hardship by staying in this relationship. Good luck, wishing u nothing but the best
Oh honey. An accident is one thing but she‚Äôs not attracted to who you are. Your real voice is the one you use. Being alone has to be a better option than being with someone who doesn‚Äôt want you for you right?
But your ‚Äòold‚Äô is your voice, just use that
This was actually heartbreaking to read
She doesn't see you as a woman.

She sees you as a man who's acting.

You are both looking for someone different than the person you're currently dating.
Your ‚Äúreal voice‚Äù is any voice time you use your voice, like an impression or anything, idk if she lives under a rock but she clearly needs to do research on trans peeps, and just how not to be a jerk
Sorry but she needs to go and give her a right telling off you told her you trans and yet she's not respecting you don't care about your feelings wants something you not not to mention name and pro nouns drop her plenty more fishing the sea hugs you valid always remember that xx
Girl, you are well within your rights to be angry. She is blatantly disregarding your wishes and how you want to be treated, and the fact that she asked you to use your ‚Äúreal voice‚Äù means that she will never see you completely as a woman. I would have left too.

My wife and I have been together for almost 15 years, but I only came out to her 1.5 years ago. To this day, she has never asked me to speak in my old masculine voice. In fact, she often reminds me to focus more on my femme voice because when I get really comfortable around people, my voice slips. I am no longer able to reach the depths that my voice used to, but it‚Äôs just so hard to keep up the higher pitch. I know that I don‚Äôt have to have a higher pitched voice to be feminine, but I‚Äôm just so PHYSICALLY feminine that not having a higher pitch really draws attention, and that bothers me. 

My wife sees this and actively tries to help me and your partner should be doing the same thing, not holding on to the person you used to be.
I needed to tell someone this because i don't know If i just trust that she will recognize me for who i am or i just finish this relationship.
Thank you for kind wordsü•π
I i think i made my decision deep down my heart but i don't have the courage to stand up for myself this way, it's hard for me but i need to.
I even forced myself and It hurt a lot to do a voice that isn't mine anymore, for the joke i get it but being asked to do it in normal situations just fucks me up.
This this this this. Your partners should love you for who you are, and not who they think you are. Clearly she thinks you‚Äôre a man, and that‚Äôs not gonna work out well for either of you.
Thank you <3.
I Hope i can get through this break, i need more time alone so i can actually love myself first just to know what is good for me or not.
Recently i just think ppl use me for their own interests and just don't care really about how i feel about things.

Character development time lol ü•≥
I'm angry and anxious af, i can't Just process the fact that i could've ended this sooner
Yeah... We got the fricking short end.

I can't help but feel miserable because of my last dates, and this one.. more trauma to the list
I had the feeling she was fetishizing me since we met, she told me she realized i was a boymodder because of the bra strings.. so..yeah
I'm breaking with her through the phone because i can't even look at her face and think about everything that happened at the same time
I will steal this idiom. Thank you.
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è

Everything's going to be fine, i can get through It.
She's bisexual and started talking with me because she noticed a ""boy wearing a Bra"" so yeah, she was curious.
I think you should just finish it, you're only gonna get more and more hurt, by what you said she clearly doesn't respect you and is trying to get you to act more ""masculine"" or do things that make you uncomfortable because she likes
She has shown every indication she does not respect you, and no indication she will recognise you for who you are. 

There‚Äôs no maybe, dump her.
I got a question for ya: you wanna borrow my boots with the heels or the composite cap boots for when you punt her ass to the curb? 

You deserve respect and love and to be treated like a person. She‚Äôs not giving you any of that, and you deserve better all the way.
Heres a tip for relationships, jobs, and most other things. If you ever find yourself thinking ""it's bad right now but it'll get better"", you're in denial. The only way it'll get better is if you make it better, by finding a better job, partner, videogame, or anything else.
she doesn't seem to be even trying though
It takes a lot of courage to stand up for your boundaries. But I believe in you. You had the courage to question who society said you were. You had the courage to embrace those feelings and follow your own path. You even had the courage to allow someone into your world. The courage to let them see the real you. You have the courage for anything. Someone once told me that courage is not the absence of fear. The absence of fear is stupidity. Courage is the ability to act in spite of the fear.
She's probably hurt you more than you realize.

Please, protect yourself. You deserve a relationship with someone who actually sees you.

EDIT: most of my dysphoria is vocal, so I understand how much that can fuck you up. The first thing my father said when we spoke post transition was that I still sounded like a boy.

That was in September. I still feel the sting from it even now.

I can't imagine how much worse it would be in an intimate context... Ugh
‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° character development time
still not your fault. you did stand up for yourself multiple times, right? and it sounds like you liked her. don't beat yourself up for being willing to give second chances

For what it‚Äôs worth, if you‚Äôve been dating since October, then that means you were a lot better than I was at standing up to a disrespectful partner. 

I was dating an abusive and disrespectful man for a entire year, and my self esteem and mental health was gradually crushed until I got the courage to leave him after a whole year. 

For others, it takes even longer, so I don‚Äôt think you failed or anything but actually did really good at standing up for yourself in comparison to others.
it's not your fault. you're just trying to exist. every human being deserves respect and it's not fair that not everyone gets it.

there's someone great for you out there i promise
All the love, girl ‚ù§Ô∏è
Okay but still, she saw you as a BOY. Now you're a girl. If you knew you were a woman before dating her, that makes you a catfish. She is still wrong for being bi-curious but you can't be upset at her for wanting your boy voice. If you aren't selfish, break up with her so she can find a man.
\+1 this! time for a change
This! You'll see, it's so much better when you're not around transphobic people. This is not the same situation but when I left my parent's house (and my transphobic mom) and started to live with lovely people that respect me, it changed a lot of things and I was much more comfortable with myself. Reading the edit I think that you'll make the right choice and I'm proud of you ! 

(Ps: I don't wanna gaslight you, maybe ""the right choice"" wasn't the words to say... only you know what is best for you of course!)
yes!
Give me the composite cap boots fr.

Sometimes i really think i don't deserve good nor bad ppl, i really need to find myself and think about what is important for me, i'm done
I wish you‚Äôd have told me that September last year
I know this is off the main topic, but your comment resonated with me, as I‚Äôm sure it did others. About your father: He almost sounds bitter from the wording, if he was indeed so brief and dry with his wording in person. I would hug you if I could, but an internet hug will need to suffice. ü§ó You are valid, a beautiful human, and you are loved. üíú
Good on ya! That‚Äôs the healthy choice for sure. All that added stress is just awful all around.
Thank you... I didn't know how much I needed to hear that.  


On reflection, I think you're absolutely right. I think he has a lot of regrets, and they've turned to bitterness over time. Doesn't help that he's absolutely TERRIBLE at apologizing for anything.  


I'll take your perspective into my next therapist session and discuss it with her. Thanks again :)

I tried to be happy but I so scared that people will make fun of me for being ‚Äúme‚Äù (I get misgendered to a f tonne that I tell of people in public then I would cry in public). Here are some photos before I got mad.		"Who the fuck is looking at you and seeing anything but woman?
I'm legit confused why and how would anyone misgender you. You look and are so pretty and more like a woman than many cis women I know.
Know the feeling darl. There is such a disconnect with how I see myself vs how others see me. Stay strong and know you're gorgeous x
Look how pretty you are!
There is just something wrong with the people who misgender you cause you look wonderful and pass amazingly
You are stunning! Sorry you're being treated like that.
Misgender people back, that's what I do. Nothing better than calling an old male bigot Janice and watching how pissed they get. If someone makes fun of you so what? It has no power over you if you give it no power. They want you to cry, they want you to feel bad. Fuck em all. Be happy and piss them off.
You look very feminine. The only reason I could think that you are being misgendered is your voice or mannerisms. Voice is such an important factor in whether we are read as male or female. Would you be comfortable posting a voice clip? Or if you feel it‚Äôs your voice look into voice therapy or surgery?
had to make sure you weren‚Äôt a trans masc who hasn‚Äôt started transitioning yet. You are a beautiful woman, i definitely echo voice training
Hello new crush üò≥ screw those people. They‚Äôre jealous at how amazing you look
honestly have no idea how many misgendered you. Unless your voice betrays you. It‚Äôs the only thing I can think of. But sweetie. You are a gorgeous woman. Be proud. You are legit gorgeous and your outfits on point.
Imma start throwing hands for you on god!
So beautiful!
lovely üéà
Dear you look beautiful don‚Äôt let other people dictate your beauty and appearance and happiness dear enjoy your beauty and happiness üòòüòòü•∞ü•∞ü§óü§óüë©‚ù§Ô∏è
If someone misgenders that gorgeous face then they are blind and dumb. You got this girl!!!
You look like a beautiful woman. You‚Äôd have to tell me you were trans
From my perspective, i bet a majority of people who do that to you are envious, jealous that you have worked hard to present as a female/woman.  Rise above that and love yourself.
How do you see a man there? If I saw you in person and didn't know this was a trans subreddit I would say you where born female
Look good to me üòÅ
You are very gorgeous.
What a sweet smile you have!
Such a cutie!
Be happy to spite the haters. Let them keep their hate.
You're beautiful and wonderful!
Girl you look way too good for any sane person to misgender
Girl you're hella pretty I'm jealous üò≠ screw them, you do you‚ù§Ô∏è
you‚Äôre beautiful. don‚Äôt let insecure people bring you down üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüíò
Mis gendered ??? HOWWW???!!! Likee
Literally HOWWW!!! I Don‚Äôt see anything but a women ?? How would anyone ?? Uhh wha??

I almost don‚Äôt want to believe you bc you pass

But you still look so good, you pass 

The only thing MAYBE?? Is the eyes? They look tierd? But like you can‚Äôt change that ? 
Maybe your voice? But idk i haven‚Äôt heard you before Soo idk 

But your a pass in my book
Beauty.
very nice  never give up. if we cannot bask in our own peronal development and beliefs were even more a prisoner in society . love and hugs there wll be more better days than not
You are flipping beautiful. Pretty sure you are a top 1% of attractive women in any room you are in. I see nothing that clocks you. Some people are just filled with hate.
People are always gonna hate. We just need you show we don‚Äôt give af. Misgendering, fuck em. You don‚Äôt need their respect because they obviously could never share space with youüíñ
Well you look very cis to me. You actually remind me of an old friend :)
You are absolutely gorgeous don‚Äôt let people‚Äôs hate of themselves ruin the person you are. Live your life to make you happy because that‚Äôs all that matters. Be yourself you are a beautiful woman
You must live in a super conservative place. Your outfits, makeup, and hair are always on point. By the way your new hair is gorgeous as I said last time üòä
Esp now there are bigots that kinda look for us so they can insult us. Jealous woman tends to do this also..ü•∫

But you're very passable so if you get misgendered it's from that it's not because you're not pretty. 

It's difficult being hurt by anyone for no reason that's the part I have trouble with.  
ü§óü§óü§óü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è
Not going to lie, you're my transition goals now.
I LOVR your look girl! :) Keep on being you. The world became a better place when you decided to be you ‚ù§Ô∏è
They‚Äôre probably just mad that you‚Äôre more put together and beautiful than most of the women they know. How they know you‚Äôre trans is where I‚Äôm confused. I wouldn‚Äôt know just seeing you and I am trans too so I feel like I notice things other people wouldn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre just looking for people to hate at this point because their lives are miserable. If I do notice another trans person I just go out of my way to be gender affirmative.
Yeah you still gorgeous anyway! I love who you are I respect it
Gorgeous!
You are beautiful and just remember that no matter what pronouns someone calls you, you are the one who knows who you truly are. If they don‚Äôt respect you and your pronouns, they can just F off.
Girl you look absolutely stunning. They just hate you because your had the courage to be yourself rather then what society tells you to be.
As far as FFS,take your time and decide what you want to change. Find a surgeon that will work with you and is recommended by bunches of others. Do whatever makes you happy with yourself.
No one can actually take away who you are. If they could then pushing cis gender identity on us would actually work. No matter what others say you're you.

If passing matters to you, you've nailed it.
Oh girl! You are so beautiful! I know it's hard but don't let the haters get you down. You are trying to be happy and live your authentic life and that is the most important thing.
Beautiful
I've been where u are so if I may, let me offer some advice for you to consider.  Before I do though let me say you look amazing and clearly you know how to put together a look.   However, it might be simply too good for what you're tying to accomplish.

There was a time when I was getting ""clocked"" often and couldn't figure out why.  Then it hit me......I was overdressed for where I was going and the hair was just too perfect which kept me from blending in.   Where I live, women will go to the mall in the most casual clothes they own.   As soon as I stopped dressing to look ""great"" and dumbed it down with jeans or a skirt just above the knee, a t-shirt with tennis shoes and putting my hair up under a baseball cap I found my way.  I learned that a successful trip to the mall (or anywhere else for that matter) was NOT drawing attention to myself by looking dressed up with an awesome hair style.  

Women don't care about what other women look like if they're wearing the most basic stuff to go out in public and very little makeup, but as soon as you dress it up, do your hair perfectly and look amazing......they're ready to inspect every little thing about you and judge you.  

You're a very passable girl.......hang in there.  It may feel tough right now but I'm cheering for you and I believe you'll figure this stuff out.
Fr!! I'm trans and I have a horrible habit of trying to pick out other trans people in crowds cause I was raised conservative and my parents would always do it.  But honestly I wouldn't even take a second look at you honey!  You look gorgeous (‚Å†¬†‚Å†‚ïπ‚Å†‚ñΩ‚Å†‚ïπ‚Å†¬†‚Å†).  I hope that makes you feel a bit better.
They do it on purpose because they don‚Äôt want to validate our existence
I think someone is just fishing for compliments with this post.
It's the hands. There's no surgery to change hand size and length of the fingers.
My mom tells me I need only hairline and that‚Äôs it but I know that I need to get forehead nose and chin done. My mom would say do you want to look notched like that tv shows. I have saved up a lot for surgery but I‚Äôm torn between two halves ma I get treat like crap in public  with people talking about me and sometime I get it wrong accusing people for talking about me but I‚Äôm on edge of my seat. I wish I had never ask those staff me ever if they were laughing about me because they probably weren‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm just not used to people.

I feel as though surgery would help me substantially. 

I was told by grandad to do walking lessons and voice then do surgery if you want to but would not even be supportive about it. 

I‚Äôm stuck. 

I just want honesty.
I‚Äôm trying to not be rude. That‚Äôs why I only ask if they were laughing at me or talking about me. I don‚Äôt want to stoop to their level.
Definitely looking into voice training but I don‚Äôt know if it actually works. I‚Äôm also going to buy those Hera breast forms so I can feel more comfortable and prepared for the surgery (FFS surgery). I was told that I need to practice my walk or do ballet classes.
Most of the time when I walk past young adults. People who have gone to the beach and the trouble makers who act foolish. And rich folks would make fun of me. Or people who look better than me. I saw a couple kissing on the tram standing and kissing each other right next to me as if they want me to notice them. Eshays who would try to be edgy and say mean things behind my back. Junkies and homeless druggies would perv at me and I feel like crap because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm only attractive to junkies smh. It‚Äôs horrible.
Thank you üôè
I‚Äôll try but it‚Äôs not easy.
Could it be my male gaze?
Was in the city
Thank you
As a kid your conservative parents would always try and pick out trans people in public crowds. Around what decade was this, seems unbelievable.

Yes because you're the only human who doesn't crave validation. How enlightened of you.
Not being a jerk costs zero dollars my dude
I‚Äôd start with not going to unqualified cis people for advice. People are saying voice training, that‚Äôs an absolutely massive factor there‚Äôs no other way around it. 

Past that, I can only say what I relate to. I‚Äôm pretty tall relative to female height especially outside of Europe, and have had to figure out what clothing works well on my silhouette, which seemingly overlaps with yours a fair bit. And this might sound pretty abstract but trying to phrase this type of stuff with just text is difficult.

You‚Äôre a big woman from the looks for the first few photos, but wearing little woman clothing. The cardigan and bag and to a lesser extent shirt in the photos are little woman clothing. They kinda shrink physique, which looks cute on smaller girls but once you‚Äôre tall enough broad enough whatever it just looks off. Same with how the shirt is cropped, if we can‚Äôt see the edges of the collar here and the cardigan is what‚Äôs doing that it‚Äôs actually making you look *more* broad believe it or not. And in your case the hairstyle while dope is also loud, so your legs and shoes look fine (black boots and leggings work with all physiques and silhouettes), hair and face presentation looks cool, model height, but then the mall girl torso clothing throws it off. If you had an oversized *and thicker cut fabric* maybe brown sweater, and a bag that looks louder/more distinct and has a thicker strap (this part about the strap is a really big deal. That thinner strap size is literally relative to look good on smaller girls), the fit is totally cohesive now. Past this, I‚Äôm just some internet rando who made one comment, I‚Äôd go to fashionable girlfriends you have (ideally tall girls) and see what sort of advice and brutally honest feedback they have to give on outfits

Tbh I don‚Äôt think the fashion aspect is really necessary if one has a passing voice, but think it‚Äôs worth mentioning. And if those pieces you‚Äôre wearing make you happy then fuck what I say, none of this is taking into account the personal feelings of the individual, which is the most important thing in personal style and fashion
Going to be 100% honest, I can't see how you'd get clocked by looks alone. How does your voice sound? Personally Ive seen ultra passing trans women who I can clock as MTF because their voice still has a masculine tone to it. I have not heard your voice, and I'm not going to judge that, just that's the only thing I can think of. Like, if passed by you irl, my first instinct is that you're just another woman, can't really tell you were amab.
Well then honestly, you're mum's a bit of a bitch. I understand the desire to pass, duh lol. Surgery isn't a cure all. Trans people will still be clocked after FFS, BA etc. It's important that decisions to change our bodies in such ways are made because it's something we want for ourselves, to make us more comfortable in our own skin, not for the benefit of others, not to try and blend in. That might be a factor, but it should be secondary. 

Idk wtf walking lessons is lol. Do men and women walk a particular way? That just sounds like a person would end up walking in an exaggerated female fashion that comes off look very fake. Voice training is obviously a long process that takes commitment, time and effort to pay off but does help people pass.

I also understand what you mean about being very sensitive to people around you. As someone who does not pass, I have a hair trigger for that sort of thing, especially because I work in a very public setting around dozens of people. It's not a healthy mindset to be in. I try to cope by telling myself that what's important is that I'm happy in my own skin.

For what it's worth, I think you're gorgeous. It's so easy to get in our heads and have a dysphoria spiral. When people tell you you're pretty, listen to them because they're not just saying it to make you feel better x
You are a much better person than I am. I personally will always be Ryde to rude people. I have a thick skin and they don't bother me really. I just make them feel how they tried to make me feel. Taste of their own medicine.
There is an entire profession that is devoted to changing your voice. It works. Find a good speech pathologist and you‚Äôll be golden. Mine specialized in trans voices and he helped tremendously.
Voice therapy is definitely cheaper than voice surgery. I didn‚Äôt really get oh with therapy so I had voice surgery which is on my profile. I‚Äôm now having post therapy which is somewhat helpful in stamina and raising my voice higher. I think they also do classes for women etiquette as well as trans women.
No problem girl we gotta have each others backs out here üíú
Life is about ups and downs the best times in life require self-determination and effort.  Learned along the way to adapt to changes in personal vital needs
You underestimate how shit people can be.  My dad calls them ""chicks with dicks"" and says their destroying America.  He still does it but I remember him starting around 2014 when trans and gay people were in the media more.  In the town I grew up in there was a guy who drove a box truck with racist and homophobic slurs written on the side, most of them followed by ""your going to burn in hell"". That guy was friends with the police, and he parked his truck in the middle of town all the fucking time, no one ever stopped him.  America is still quite homophobic and transphobic in some places.  I'm barely 2 decades old and I've been called the f slur many times by people my age.
I mean I have a family member that isn‚Äôt conservative, is gay and pagan and not too long ago they were in a call with a friend and started talking about how they don‚Äôt get, ‚Äúthey/them pronouns‚Äù and started making transphobic jokes. Even said something about ‚Äútheybies‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure what it was bc eventually I had to put in my earbuds bc I knew if I confronted them about it I‚Äôd accidentally out myself soooo

Plus they were being so loud I could barely hear my video and that‚Äôs was just as nerve wracking considering I was in the opposite room.

Plus they‚Äôve said on multiple occasions in not so many details about how trans ppl are going against the gods bc the gods gave them that gender for a reason. So yea some ppl are just fucking assholes. Makes it even worse is that they were born around the time Stonewall happened.
Transphobes don‚Äôt make sense. They just hate
Not to take away from op's frustration -- I wish I looked that good -- but proportions of things like straps, accessories, even cuffs and collar width is crucial.  Plus size has the same problem though there's more choices than used to be.  In my 20s being trans was overwhelming but (considering the other things I have made time for since)  I wish I had learned to sew and design my own clothes.
I sound like a guy or butch lesbian. It‚Äôs creating discomfort when I‚Äôm in work situations too. I feel out of place and draggy. Shudders. Is it too late to train my voice?
I used to think this way same as you but it will only make me feel like crap because it‚Äôs not who I am. 

It doesn‚Äôt stop people from thinking that we‚Äôre crazies in the street and are equivalent to junkies.

Man if only Jim Crow (or creator of) were real person he would only be the person I would yell at. Tomato juice and all lol.
I‚Äôm prioritising ffs surgery because I thought that I need a bit if work done. Then later on my boobs so I can replace the breast forms (i want 38C). Do you know any surgeon who could produce natural result that doesn‚Äôt look fake (for ffs surgery)? Anyone have ideas?
Love me some down votes for trying to help lol
As a person from the south I can confirm shit like that happens here.
It's never too late to start voice training. I won't tell you it's easy though. It's a learned skill, kinda like playing an instrument. Personally I have been voice training for roughly 5mo, and while I know my voice still can sound fairly masculine (especially when I forget to use it), but I can clearly tell a difference between how I used to sound vs how I sound now. 

There's an app called voice tools that helped me track this greatly. It will show your tone, pitch (and whether it's male/female or androgynous range), and also a little story you can read, which will then show you what % was more masc to fem. Seeing fem overtake masc overtime is highly euphoric. Additionally, videos on YouTube (a popular one is trans voice lessons) can help a ton. It won't be instantaneous, but you will see progress as long as you keep at it!

Finally, you are absolutely stunning hun! I couldn't even dream if being as beautiful as you are. And if people talk and have opinions, that's all they are. In the grand scheme of things, thier opinions shouldn't hold any weight on your happiness of being a woman (I know it's *super* difficult to basically stop caring what others think, but if you can get past that hurdle, or even work your way towards it will help immensely)

I wish you all the best hun! Hopefully you managed to pull *something* useful from this üòÅüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüíú
It's never too late. There's tons of voice training online that you can practice with, or if you have the money you can try seeing a vocal coach. You don't need to have the most perfectly feminine voice but voice training does help with passing.
I'm a veteran so I am probably much less inclined to deal with idiots than the average person. The military gave me a thick skin and the ability to shut down stupidity as quickly as possible. I hit em back quick with their own bs and keep moving. It's the same thing I do with other crazies. Tell me the moon landing was fake and I tell em the are a sheep for thinking yhe moon is real, tell me a second gunman killed JFK and I tell em JFK was a lizard man from Mars. Earth is flat, lol its all a simulation. Misgender me I misgender em back. 

Always gotta throw them off to shut it down.
If you want to consider ffs r/Transgender_Surgeries has a lot of discussion and a wiki.

Agree with the suggestion of ballet, it helped my daughter.  Other forms of dance (belly dance is usually very gender positive if you have a good studio in your area) probably good too.
Yeah you get it.  Living in the south as someone LGBT or a racial group that isn't white is quite the fucking experience.  Everyone wants to try and convert you to Christian, hurt you, or just be generally sarcastic towards you.  The best part is the questions, like ""are you one of them drags?"", ""Y'all can't be dressed like that theres children around"".  I love the south cause so many parts of it are beautiful and I want to die here but damn the people can really be awful.
I second voice tools(as well as the rest of this post. It's been useful if not cringey to hear myself back. I pass on the phone pretty much 100% of the time, in person around 80% voice wise, although I want my jaw and browline done. Other than that, I'll just say this, which I've said before on here: slay isn't just an appearance, it's your state of mind, the confidence to live as the human you are. There is so much time for you to get the little things done but YOU have to do it. It's a scary world for us out there, so we have to be fierce. My state government currently wants to crush us, so we have to be strong. There are people who would gladly cause great harm physically and emotionally to us, so we have to be willing to fight if necessary. But at the end of the day, we are who we are, and no one can take that from us.
Is voice training actually useful for anyone, or are there some cases where the surgery is required to reach the more feminine vocal range? Cuz I've just started and I can't possibly see how my voice will every sound feminine. I can't get higher pitch at all and my voice just cracks or whatever.
I mess around with voice tools, and I think it can be handy too how it can record a bit and you can play it right back, though it basically just does pitch, which is supposed to be pretty irrelevant versus resonance or whatever, only I don‚Äôt understand what those other things ARE, nor what to physically do to change them.
Don‚Äôt forget all the racial and sexual slurs we get called. That‚Äôs including the T-slur. 

And not to mention the ones that are always starting conversations like, ‚Äú I‚Äôm not racist but-‚Äú or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not homophobic but-‚Äú and it‚Äôs like yep imma stop you right there and remove myself from this conversation and do something that doesn‚Äôt require conversating with you üòÇ 

Even had instances where just cuz I‚Äôm white, racists, homophobes, transphobes, etc. will start spouting their bigotry and then I have to call em out.
A lot of us are changing this shit in the south and that‚Äôs why republicans are freaking out and passing these terrible anti-LGBT laws. They can‚Äôt stand that people are getting tired of their hate. It‚Äôs desperation. They are flexing hard while they still can.
Well I can't speak for everyone,but I would say I used to have a pretty masculine voice, and much like yourself, I didn't believe that I could reach a feminine range. While I'm sitting fairly low on the fem scale, I am now within the range *almost* naturally by this point. I've even shocked some coworkers lol
YukkoEX (on tiktok is where I saw this) shared a tip that helped me quite a bit. I can't remember exactly what was said, but to adjust resonance you basically want to reduce the space in your throat. They suggested to swallow, and pay attention to the feeling (more or less?) The more ""closed"" your throat is, the higher your resonance will be. This was easily the *hardest* part, because it's quite difficult to figure out how to do this. Even now I run into issues where my voice will legit just cut out while practicing this

Edit: found the video https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZMYbNqeBn/
Huh, maybe I can do it then. It's just idk how to control my voice. And I still need to get over the embarrassed feeling I get when practicing. It's stupid but I still feel it.
That‚Äôs interesting, thanks!

I‚Äôm super clueless with this, and obnoxiously I feel like even to the extent I feel I sound better or worse, it‚Äôs not consistent. 

Like I just tried to do what you described while running VoiceTools, so I could listen back to it, and then did it without doing that, and like I actually‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs anywhere near perfect but it‚Äôs not Vin Diesel sounding to me, but then, especially when I‚Äôm talking to my mom I hate how it sounds most of the time‚Ä¶ Although you with that, I guess not all the time.

I don‚Äôt know, I wish I could‚Äôve just avoided the damage that was done to me, I hate this. 

Right this very moment  I feel like I don‚Äôt sound very bad, but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and it may slip away at any moment, and I don‚Äôt even trust that it‚Äôs decent without being able to hear it back immediately. 

I really wish there was an app that would tell you what your residence was you could adjust and practice! 

At this point, I can‚Äôt even tell how masculine and sound even when I‚Äôm specifically trying. Like I know, is I dictate this it‚Äôs above the androgynous range in Voice Tools, that‚Äôs without even necessarily matters, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the worst thing ever, but‚Ä¶ Honestly, I think if I sounded like this all the time, but I looked pretty I would be fine, because there‚Äôs cis women who could pass for male from their voice, but then you SEE them
I have faith in you! There is definitely a learning curve, I won't deny that. But once you know how to control your resonance, it should move along petty quickly
Do you have any advice on how I can even begin?
I'm no professional, and as soon as I learned how to control resonance I kinda went off the road and did my own thing. That being said, I hear trans voice lessons on YouTube is a good place to learn, a lot of people seem to reccomend it"	129derh	trans	587	0.98	2023-04-02 07:13:21

Oh honey I'm sorry, I'm scared to correct my parents cause I've only met with them crying when I do. You're not alone sister and you look fabulous in that
You're so damn cute. That sucks your parents don't support you üò£
Hey, maybe the fact that they still let you keep your stuff is a good sign they can change? Some people are very slow, but I understand when it's hopeless too.

Yea look spanktasticly gorjus, stay strong girl,  my heart goes out to you, and the people who's parents are having problems with you, I was blessed with nice parents, I'm now 57, but I believe that they WILL come round eventually, maybe not as much as you'd want them to, just forget the hatred, the disappointment, live YOUR LIFE THE WAY You WANT, if you don't it WILL BITE YOU ON THE ARSE, I should know I didn't come out till I was 49, 

I wish you all the very best of luck,
You look adorable! Don't let them keep you down.
I see SO many of you young trans girls in here who have the most unsupportive parents *ever* yall's stories break my heartüò•  
Focus on finding a way to escape when you all are able to. You can't force your parents to accept you, but you can set boundaries when you move out. 
Stay focused stay strong y'allüåà

YOU LOOK AMAZING!!

It's a good question, I'm not sure. I've seen stories of other parents crying when told but it depends on the parents I guess

My brother doesn't want me to present a female at his graduation.	" So my brother is graduating from grad school this May and despite having come out to him more than a full two years ago he still sees me and my identity as a joke and a punchline rather than who I am, whenever I suggested that I would wear a dress to his graduation he would laugh and would say ""it's my day, not yours"" as if I was only doing this for attention and despite claiming to support the community and having gay friends, he still sees me as an attention seeker and says I owe him ""being normal at the graduation"" because I couldn't make it to his undergrad graduation.

Edit: while I do understand everyone who is saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck him‚Äù or ‚Äúwear the dress‚Äù I don‚Äôt him want mad at me for presenting the way I want, this is a big deal for my family since he‚Äôs the first person in our family to obtain such a degree and I felt bad enough not going to his undergraduate graduation. As of now I don‚Äôt plan on going unless he tells me I can present as I wish."	"I just would not go, why support someone who doesn't support me?
If I were you I wouldn‚Äôt present myself there at all.
The average age of a Grad School graduate in USA is 33.

Unless he's a super-genius, he's not a little boy chronologically even if he is emotionally.

I personally would not go. He's long into adulthood, he's made his demand and it's beyond unreasonable.

This would be one step before a relationship-ender for me. I would not go, and I would not associate with him until he started treating me with the respect and dignity I deserve.

He's demanding you disassociate yourself from yourself as a condition of his being willing to publicly associate with you.

Would you demand that of HIM? OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T.

If you did demand that of him, would he do it? OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T.

Do not let him demand that of you. You are not a prop in the movie of his life, don't let him treat you like one.

We may have only ONE person in this world we count on accepting us as we are, and that is ourselves. Don't let someone steal that from you. If they won't accept you, you still have yourself.

Whereas if you compromise to please them, you still won't really please them, and the STILL won't accept you... and now what have you gained? A continued relationship with an abusive person?
Ugh. I'm sorry.

If it were me, I think I'd say I'm either going as the real me, or I'm not going. I can be in their life or out of it, but I won't be a lie.
>I owe him ""being normal at the graduation""

In my professional opinion, he can eat shit.
""It's my day, not yours""

It's your life and gender, not his. He doesn't get to decide who you are.

""says I owe him 'being normal'""

There's nothing normal about the level of contempt he's treating you with. Especially after two entire years. It's utterly inexcusable. You deserve love, OP. I'm sorry your brother is choosing to be cruel. You don't owe him anything. An option to consider might be skipping his graduation and spending the time doing something kind for yourself.
Yeah so if you want my opinion go done up and In a very pretty dress. You are already normal screw his opinion
Um he should stop being transphobic because being trans is normal im normal, we all are normal because i work a job and i want a relationship with the right guy im as normal as can be.
""If my normal is too much for you then I won't go, I wouldn't want to distract you on your day.""
Pretty simple way to fulfil his request.

""If you don't want the real me at your graduation, then she won't be there.""

Then don't go.
Take the low road and wear the most attention seeking dress. all done up makeup/hair. 

Make sure to get in all the pictures so he will have to forever remember that you‚Äôre unapologetically trans üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
Don‚Äôt go.
The way I see it your being normal his undergrad ceremony is to wear a dress presenting, I mean you are female, so boy modding would be abnormal from your view point.
Tbh yeah I just wouldn‚Äôt go and I‚Äôd tell him that every day is his from now on, because I won‚Äôt be a part of the rest
I wouldn't go. It's not about stealing his day or anything like that. You're just living your life. Fuck him if he can't deal.
Don‚Äôt go, why support him if he won‚Äôt support you lol.
Don't go, if he asks why you didn't, tell him why 



""You said you didn't want me there""

If he's asking you to be someone else when you show up then he doesn't want you there to begin with.
I only see two options here go fully dolled up and outshine him  or don't go at all.  
i'd chose number 1 personaly
""It's my day, not yours""

Well it's your life and not his, if he can't understand that your gender identity isn't a joke and just who you are than it's his problem if he gets upset that you're not there
Why would you go?

You are a good person for even thinking about going still. 

I hope you decide not to go. He's treated you horribly, but wants you to be part of his day?

The choices are... Go as your authetnic self and endure more abuse from this AH, or boy mode to help a transphobic brat have a special day. In both options you lose.
You need to make a clear boundary ""If you wont let me be myself, I wont be there."" If they get upset that is their fault not yours. You arent doing this for attention.
My initial response was going to be don't go then. After consideration though, idk your family responsibilities or dedication so I don't understand the struggle. That said, consider this: pick something neutral to wear, like, say,  androgynous 80s but chic and not over the top, and if anyone asks you introduce yourself how you want. Therefore you're not ""presenting yourself"" nor ""seeking attention"", not taking away from his day while still being yourself. Idk your style but toeing that line can be a fun little ""ok I'll play by your rules"" smirk. Just a thought.
Presenting female is your normal. He either wants you there as yourself or he doesn't want you there. Pretty simple math if you ask me.
I guess I'm petty, I would show up in a dress, and I would have a list of points to argue about why it's okay for me to be in a dress, and it's not okay for them to be a bigot.
I would skip the party, he can have ""his day"" all alone.
He expects the ability to disrespect you as his graduation present.
Going as a woman is normal it's just how you are. Technically masquerading as a man would be weird it's just often hard to get other people to see that from our perspective as trans people. 

I'm really sorry OP this is a tough situation.
Don't go.
Yeah that‚Äôs what most cis really thi k some don‚Äôt say it done do , we aren‚Äôt normal and we have a mental issue .
Tbh yeah I just wouldn‚Äôt go and I‚Äôd tell him that every day is his from now on, because I won‚Äôt be a part of the rest
don't go or invite all of us to slap him one at a time.
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that you have to deal with this. :/ He is putting you in an impossible situation where he thinks that you owe him to be there and also not be there as who you are. Maybe you could ask him, not in a sarcastic manner but actually seriously, if he actually wants you to come. If it bothers him so much, then it would probably be best to just not go. 
If it were me, and I wanted to be a bit more confrontational, I would show up wearing a feminine outfit with a skirt but make it conservative and definitely not attention-seeking. Mid-length skirt, black tights, dress shirt, no heels. This would make him look bad in front of the others if he were to publicly say something against it.
Oh, screw that dude. Tell him you either go as yourself or you won't bother showing up. You don't owe him the denial of your identity.
Then don't present as female. Don't be present at all!
This is a terribly difficult situation. As trans people many of us are made to feel that relationships in our life are conditional, that we have to be who we are on someone else‚Äôs terms to avoid losing them. Everyone has a different relationship to their family and to the concept of family and everyone is going to have different priorities. From the outside we all want each other to stand up for who we are and be unapologetically ourselves. It‚Äôs a noble goal, but it asks people to risk so much personally. It‚Äôs a big ask, one that not all of us have the freedom to follow through on every single time. I don‚Äôt have any fresh advice for you. I hope your brother comes around and realizes he‚Äôs being really terrible to you. I hope that you‚Äôre able to be there for his big day because it sounds like you would like to be there to support him. If you can‚Äôt, know that it doesn‚Äôt make you a bad sister or anything like that. I feel for you and I‚Äôm routing for you. I‚Äôm sorry.
It kind of sounds like he doesn't want a sister *shrug*
How can he claim to support the LGBTQ+ community whilst misgendering and mocking his sister? After two years?! Screw him
As tough as this is, I'll offer a contrary piece of advice. If you hold your ground you will be morally right but you'll create a rift that will hard to bridge later. If your brother and your family are important to you, moving slowly and ""compromising"" may be a better strategic path to getting them on your side than holding your ground. I'm not saying this is the right thing to do, but with other people, sometimes the path to getting what we want and deserve isn't always straight. 

If you dig your heels in and don't go or present as yourself against your brother's wishes, you may create a rift that's hard to close. Having a conversation later on about why this was important to you will be harder to do because he may be less amenable to listening. If you concede, for now, you may have a bigger window to explain why this was painful for you and how his non-acceptance hurt you. Giving some ground now can keep a door open for more acceptance later. It's not fair to you, I'll be clear, but that's often the case with family. If they're important to you, you may need to bring them along slowly. 

It's easy for strangers to tell you to let people go but it's often not as easy in practice. People we love, and people that love us, sometimes do things that hurt us. Sometimes they figure that out and things get better (sometimes they don't and we let them go). Letting go will always be an option later on. But it's much harder to fix a broken relationship than to push a working one forward inch by inch.
Then dont go if he wants u to go in a costume pretending to be someone else, then why bother going , you don‚Äôt owe him shit, he clearly hasn‚Äôt accepted you for who you are , make it clear to him that you either go as yourself or you don‚Äôt go at all
Don't go :)
Family that doesn‚Äôt support you isn‚Äôt family. Sorry hun. Don‚Äôt grace him with your presence
Would he come to your graduation dressed as a leprechaun if you asked him to? No? Then you don't have to go to his dressed as a man. Also he sounds like a complete POS. If he doesn't respect your identity and sees you as a joke then he doesn't deserve to have you there.
DONT GO.
If he doesn‚Äôt want you there as yourself, don‚Äôt go.  Your only two options are to go or not go.  You can‚Äôt be expected to live a lie for his sake, so it‚Äôs not a choice of wether you present female or not, it‚Äôs a matter of whether or not you‚Äôre welcome there, and if you‚Äôre not welcome there as you, then you‚Äôre simply not welcome there at all.  Make sure it‚Äôs clear to him that‚Äôs the line he‚Äôs drawing.
either go as you or don‚Äôt go. under no circumstances should we deny who we are because of someone else. don‚Äôt give them that power. family is chosen.
Would he like you to come? Then he has to accept that you come as who you are. You could also wear something more ambiguous, like a nice womens pantsuit‚Ä¶
Well your brother sounds like a bit of an asshole. I don't have any good advice for this, but I wish you the best :)
Don't go! Stay home blast some musica. Drink a yummy monster of choice and eat some beef jerky. Don't forget to put your feet up too. I'd jam out and game and vc with people that actually care about me more than some dummy that thinks they will have life changing memories at their graduation. Even more so at a high school graduation. Ain't nobody care about that. I have friends that don't even get to experience it because of hardship they had to do their schooling via GED before moving on to college. Save yourself the trouble and get a nice meal and tell him to shovel it.
If I were you, I definitely would not go. He doesn‚Äôt deserve you showing up if he doesn‚Äôt respect you enough to let you wear as you please
If I where you I wouldn‚Äôt go if it doesn‚Äôt end here when will it I think this is a good place to stand your ground and show him you won‚Äôt be bullied so don‚Äôt go simple as it the short story he‚Äôs shown blatant disrespect and also what do your family think about his attitude
It seems like you want to support your brother in his accomplishments because he‚Äôs your brother, but he‚Äôs being completely unsupportive of you and you‚Äôre feeling conflicted between being a good sister and being true to yourself. Is that accurate? If so, know that it‚Äôs ok to feel both things and that there are other ways you can acknowledge his achievement without squeezing yourself into his narrow mindedness. What about not attending and sending a congratulatory card? Of course all of the other suggestions here are viable options as well. In the end, you should do what feels good and true for YOU. If he thinks you presenting as female is trying to take attention away from him, that‚Äôs a him problem. You feeling safe, confident, and true to yourself is your responsibility, not anyone else‚Äôs feelings. üíúüíúüíú
Guess family doesn't mean shit to him. You deserve to be able to be yourself, you going as your true authentic self isn't making it about yourself and you don't owe him shit.

Be safe, love yourself üíü
No, he's the first transphobic scumbag to earn a degree and he doesn't deserve your presence.
From a cis perspective, you don‚Äôt owe him, or your family anything. So, the degree might be seen as a big deal. But, so is your gender identity, and if he can‚Äôt respect that, why should you respect him getting a degree?
If he don't want you to live to your true self then I would have to say don't go. Its not about him or his graduation. Its about you if he don't support you then don't support him. At 66 yrs old I have to say live your life as you want to because life's to short not to.
Then tell him ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but if you can't accept me the way I am, I won't be going.""

I just read your edit.  The fact that it's a big deal to the family, drives the point home even further if you refuse to go.  This is HIS decision.  Not yours.  You are not being an asshole for being yourself.
You are allowed to stand your ground for who you are. I understand it‚Äôs family but they don‚Äôt get a pass just because of a special event. Maybe you can stream it so you can still show support if you‚Äôd like or if that‚Äôs an option. I‚Äôm sorry you have to experience this. 

Normalize not giving into the old traditions of family or friendship dynamics and having to respect others simply out of courtesy for their projected toxic and fragile feelings.
I‚Äôd say go and wear the dress. yes, it is his day but you still matter. just because your brother is graduating it doesn‚Äôt mean you should be forced to not be who you are.
Yuck. Sounds like a business major ü§Æ

Not to be dramatic but death before detransition. Even for a day. He sounds like a supremely disrespectful person, so why should you respect his learning how to screw the poors over with stonks or whatever (sorry I'm running with the business major thing)
If you value you relationship with him more then you value the pain, go in in your regular clothes. Not a dress, but in something nice. But make it explicate that your pain is a gift to him.
So sorry for what you are going through. Not an easy situation but I know you will find a way to be true to yourself. Families can be very taxing
Heres the thing you need to realize girlie, and I apologize  that this is when the bandaid needs to be ripped off, and for what Im about to say for I say it with love.

Why in the FUCK do you care about this achievment from this asshole who cant even be bothered to respect your identity? And you want to go out of your way to appease this douche?

Fuck that guy! With a cactus! You deserve better, and you need to respect yourself enough to put your foot down. ""Its my day not yours"" are the words of a petulant child who isnt getting their way. You arent showing up to his wedding in a wedding gown for fuck sakes.

So when you honestly think about his award and ceremony, really let the next words sink in, sit in them and marinate.

Who. The. Fuck. Cares.

Be yourself, and dont let anyone not even your family, ESPECIALLY when they want your praise. Why praise his achievement when he doesnt deserve you calling him your brother in the first place.

Im sorry if this is too harsh, but people dont deserve your time and energy if they cant be damned to accept you. That goes triple for family.
Sorry to hear that but you don‚Äôt have to go also. I didn‚Äôt go to my sisters wedding because she and a lot of my family don‚Äôt understand me and it‚Äôs better not to be in that situation. You don‚Äôt owe anyone anything and you‚Äôre mental health is the most important. I hope he will learn sooner than later that you are more than what you look like and take this narrative out of his head. Keep your head up and be proud of who you are! üåàüíïüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
I am thinking about something similar myself. My favorite baby cousin is having his first communion and his parents are not usually accepting. I don‚Äôt want to want to stir up trouble with my aunt and uncle by going as myself because I don‚Äôt want to lose my cousin or not go and appear to be snubbing my cousin on their big day. May I suggest a women‚Äôs pant suit or something that can be read as androgynous or both feminine and masculine?
I would recommend wearing a dress if you want to, but being sure that it's modest and formal. You're right, your identity isn't a joke, and your clothing should reflect this by being appropriate for a graduation setting. Something simple and not too flashy, but also something that is still a reflection of you. ""Seeking attention"" would be showing up in a glittery ballgown or something. There's nothing wrong with wearing clothes that suit your gender identity in public, and the sooner this is accepted, the easier it will be. Of course, I'm not in your situation so if you think wearing a dress would draw violence or hatred your way, then it's up to you to decide whether or not you feel safe wearing a dress in front of your brother just yet.
I can‚Äôt see where you owe him your presence at all
It doesn't matter how important this day is for him, he doesn't deserve it. Screw him. Be yourself or don't go.
> despite having come out to him more than a full two years ago he still sees me and my identity as a joke

> ...

>Edit: while I do understand everyone who is saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck him‚Äù or ‚Äúwear the dress‚Äù I don‚Äôt him want mad at me 

He doesn't respect you. Why show him any respect?

> this is a big deal for my family 

And your identity isn't a big deal for you? In no way will you showing up in girl mode detract from his moment on the stage, or his accomplishments that got him there.
I am not going to read through all the other commitments, so please forgive me if this is already been said. I support you in whatever you choose to do because there are no rules to this. No set right or wrong, We each do what we can do when we can do it. Could this idea be a sort of middle ground : could you go as your true self but no identity as his sister? Like sit by yourself? Take a friend and sit away from the your family unit. That way you are being yourself while also showing support for your brother. This is about you and your heart. If you want to be you AND show support, why can't you? Like an Anonymous donor - they give from their heart and do not need recognition. Being there on his day doesn't mean having to high-five or take shots. It just means showing up! I wonder about my daughter's future acceptance of me and if they will not want me to show up bc they are ashamed or embarrassed. My support of them is not reliant on their support of me. I love them. I will wait forever if they choose to turn away from me. I am not dependent on them to know Me. You are not dependent on your brother. You don't need his permission to love him. If you want to show your love by being physically present, you can do so in a way that doesn't make him upset, if you want to. I am sad he feels the way he does about you and I do not agree with it. I hope one day he is able to grow up enough and be strong enough to change his views and feelings. This is about you though. ""Some will wave their hats. Some will turn their backs."" I hope you are able to figure out how to exist for you and to be happy!!!!??
Don't go
Go as who you‚Äôre or don‚Äôt go at all.
Okay, so I see your edit, but your brother is a legit piece of shit and you should probably not be around him sweetie. Family is nice when it works, but you can find new family if all they do is hurt you.
Don‚Äôt feel bad for bigots, family or otherwise.
I feel you. My mother could not deal with me transitioning and didn‚Äôt even want me calling the hospital when she was sick and dying, because she didn‚Äôt want the nurses desk to say ‚Äúyour daughter is calling‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt say I was her daughter, I just asked to speak to my mother and was clearly female on the phone. In the end, my family didn‚Äôt even tell me she‚Äôd died until she was already in the ground, because they and Mom were mortified I would show up en femme. Which I would have. Years of bad feelings resulted. And people wonder why we‚Äôre touchy about things.
Why even go under those circumstances?
I am going through a very similar situation. I am no contact with my parents as they refuse to acknowledge my gender identity. My little sister has her undergrad graduation next month (the first of the family) and wants me to go. My solution was to watch virtually. Don‚Äôt put other peoples beliefs and feelings over your own well being. You are valid and important and anyone who cannot see that is worth reevaluating as a part of your life. Good luck, know that the community is on your side :)
this is someone who is graduating from *grad* school? what a childish request to have. it‚Äôs not your fault for getting attention because you‚Äôre presenting as yourself.
You shouldn‚Äôt hide your identity because other people are uncomfortable with it. Being female is who you are and if you‚Äôre going (which you don‚Äôt have to) you have to bring your full self. 

He‚Äôd probably never dream of dictating what the cis women who are attending can wear, he doesn‚Äôt get to do that to you either.
Everyone is saying ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt go if he doesn‚Äôt want me to present as myself‚Äù I SAY, just go and don‚Äôt tell him you‚Äôre presenting as yourself and show him and you‚Äôre whole family that you can be present as the woman you are and still not take up all the space. And also be respected as a woman by other people. Fuck it. Just do it and be unapologetic for it, I promise it‚Äôll make them realize that you are valid in your identity.
it is difficult to do, but my family didn't change their attitude about me until i started to cut them out of my life and they realized that they were going to lose me. don't go to his graduation. don't talk to him for a few years. let him figure out if he cares about you or not. and if he doesn't, good riddance.
Despite the edit, why would you want to go to a party celebrating someone that hurts you (even if they share a blood bond with you, that's no excuse), then also makes you go in their terms which displease you?

Just food for thought, when people are this shitty, you have the power most of the time to find a way to avoid being splattered by their shit. I understand it's a big moment for the family, but does that include hurting you?
It's a 2 way street. If he won't respect you. Why should you be forced to respect him, just because he's your brother. One thing I've learned since transitioning is my happiness is much more important to me than my family relationship.
stay home ! if he won‚Äôt support you! then u are not in any way obligated to support him
as an out trans woman for over 10yrs i‚Äôd say do it. if he has a problem with it make it clear that it means he has a problem with you. because you are who you are. period.
Not going or going in a dress after he has asked you not to seem like extreme alternatives, especially for immediate family. How much have you talked to him about this? I get that he ""sees"" you as his brother, but maybe you can talk this through with him? Has he ever seen you dressed fem? Are you close enough to meet up in person and have a convo? I do agree that you need to be yourself.
Find a feminine suit! If you can't, buy a normal suit and add some frills and other things you like! You'd still sorta be listening to his demand, while also giving him a little ""fuck you""!
Wear. The. Dress.
You *do* owe him being normal at the graduation. Wearing the dress **IS** your normal. >:3
As someone who experienced something similar to this I say go and go in that beautiful dress just to show up if he wants you to leave then respect that and leave since it's about him. My brother didn't want me to go to his wedding presenting female but I was invited so I bought a gorgeous outfit and still showed up he ended up saying ‚Äúyou look amazing and I wish I knew how gorgeous you'd be and sorry for not immediately accepting you I hope you can forgive me sis‚Äù and we are currently on good terms. I hope you get the response you want!ü´∂üèº
How he's being selfish for sure, it might be his big grad day and such. But at that point i wouldnt be in the crowd. 
He needs to understand that he's being willingly ignorant and hateful. You can teach him all you want but as that saying is ""You can lead a horse to water, but you cant make him drink it."" He'll learn when he wants to. Which really sucks but in most cases that people like your brother are doing. If he cant except you for you then why should you give the him the satisfaction of his ignorance holding over you? 
Where a suit with heels, where make up, let your hair down if its long enough, wear make up. Hey you're wearing the suit right? Why not fem it up everywhere else? Hell even where girl perfume. If they protest say your going with what HE said about you having to where a suit. He didnt say anything else other wise at least from your post right?
I know you said this is a big deal, but don‚Äôt let your brother manipulate you into thinking your the wrong. You shouldn‚Äôt go, he doesn‚Äôt deserve your presence at all. Him saying it‚Äôs his day is flat out manipulative. Even if it is, you still have a right to be yourself and he can go fuck himself sideways if he thinks otherwise. Let him cry about it.
Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you who you are, either don‚Äôt go or go there as your real self, not some shell of a person that your brother likes.
To appeal to the supportive aspect of OP, maybe a dress, although I'm sure you'd look great in, just doesn't appeal to his standards. Although regardless of what they are, you could wear something less obviously feminine like some tennis shoes and a skirt with a good matching t-shirt? This is just a suggestion to try to figure out a solution, but you won't draw attention from anyone other than him (but maybe some individuals who think you're pretty) by wearing a dress. Also regarding the ally-ship we have those in the community who are other parts of the community who are transphobic he could be acting the same way. Conclusively he is transphobic and he doesn't reserve the right to tell you what you should or shouldn't wear regardless of who the attention is directed to.
If you go as female presenting, he's going to expect you to always change your identity to suit him. That's not the way identity works, and the sooner he learns that, the sooner you two can have a real relationship.
If he‚Äôs embarrassed by you, he doesn‚Äôt deserve you
Get some self-respect at first
You should be there for him not matter how much of an ass he is. Go as yourself and if he gets mad tell him ‚Äúdo you want to make this day about what I‚Äôm doing or do you want to go out there and celebrate and have me there with you‚Äù he‚Äôs the one that gets to choose who‚Äôs going to be the center of attention not you.
He wants you to be someone that you are not, so you should not be present at his graduation.
You give him 2 options. You come wearing what you want being who you are or you dont come at all. Honestly if he went with the second one and doesn't come around, i understand this being hard, but I'd cut him out. Its not up to you its up to him to not be shitty and other you. This is not your responsibility to be someone else for his 'big day'. You are you and that is not negotiable. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Honey people are going to be mad at you for stupid things.  You can‚Äôt live your life for them.   I know you love your brother and don‚Äôt want him mad at you but it you giving in to him will just make him think he can do it to you all the times.  Sometimes we have to let people be mad at us.
self love is much more important than anything else.. yourself deserve to be respected by you and loved..no one should sacrifice their own hapiness for others even if they were our loved ones.. in order to make people around you happy, you should make yourself happy first.
Philadelphia huh, don't dismiss your brother without talking it out throughly.

My advice would be to ask your brother how important it is that you present yourself as something you are not at his graduation, but before that do some reflection on how important it is to you on a scale of 1-10 to be yourself on that day, 10 being critical for your wellbeing, 1 being you don't care at all. If both of you are 10 or very similar, ask him if there is some compromise, for example show him the different clothes and makeup you want to wear if anything is acceptable to him. If he says 5 and you say 9 then he should accept that it is more important to you and if a true brother he will accept you for who you are, even at ""his day"".

If you can't reach a compromise then tell him exactly how you feel about it, that even though he consider it ""his day"", this is also **your life** and as brother and sister you don't owe each other anything but love and support, there is no ""owing"", only friendship and love.

If that is unacceptable to him then at least you know where you stand, and can then choose not to go with a perfectly good conscience and nothing left unsaid.
My younger brother misgendered me when wishing me a happy birthday, which was 3 months into HRT and 1 month after I started presenting as female in public.

I told him I appreciate him congratulating me, but I reminded him I‚Äôm Eva now. He ignored me.

I sent him a message again, and he told me he's uncomfortable calling me by my name, and he doesn‚Äôt see me as a woman. I told him that I understand my transition must be hard on others, but there is no point in congratulating me on my birthday in a way that will only hurt me. I understand people will still slip up sometimes, but I at least expect them to try.

He refused to even try, so I told him I rather we don‚Äôt communicate anymore, because it‚Äôs too painful for me. This was a bit over a year ago, and we haven‚Äôt talked since.

He had a child a few months later. I‚Äôm sad I can‚Äôt be in the child's life, as I was so excited being an aunt. But I refuse to be seen as a mentally ill uncle. It‚Äôs too painful.

You may feel like you‚Äôre doing this to your family, but it‚Äôs them who don‚Äôt accept and support you. Your brother has made the decision that you shouldn‚Äôt show up at his graduation as your true self. So I hope you won‚Äôt go anyway and adhere to his demands. Please respect yourself. It will be difficult to cut ties with family, but you can‚Äôt live up to their expectations, and you shouldn‚Äôt fight for acceptance and validation of people who don‚Äôt readily give it.

Surround yourself with people who love you and accept you the way you are. That‚Äôs what I did. I can yell you that you will be much happier for it.

Your brother may come around when he‚Äôs ready, or he may never will. Please don‚Äôt wait for him, and just continue living your life. This is YOUR life. You don‚Äôt owe anyone your presence, especially not if you have to show up as anything less than your true and authentic self.
Ik it might be controversial but I would just wear something that is ‚Äûnormal‚Äú in his eyes not only to just stop any arguments that could come up if you didn‚Äôt but to not embarrass him. Idk your brother so I can only judge from this post but he seems to see you as a male and probably all of his friends and classmates too cause he is probably also speaking of you in school as if u where a male which means everyone is expecting you to present yourself as one. And when you would show up with a dress it would be weird for everyone who expected something else. I think if you would 100% pass it wouldn‚Äôt be that much of a problem sadly for most people it‚Äôs a long and hard process which takes several years (I am also far from passing for now). So for the sake of your brother I would do it just once so he‚Äôs happy and you don‚Äôt ‚Äúembarrass‚Äù him infront of his classmates. don‚Äôt wanna offend you with that post I think it‚Äôs just the best approach most people here run with the head through the wall without caring for anybody but themselves and expect everyone to be ok with everything they do which isn‚Äôt the case most of the time and can ruin completely fine relationships
I agree. I wouldn't go to a graduation for someone who doesn't give me minimum respect.
Yeah, fuck this shit. Why even bother if he's still not supporting her
This.
Easier said than done with family. It can be such a difficult struggle, and I don't envy anyone who has to go through it.
Fr. Yuck. Sounds like a non-family member.
Being a woman *is* normal.
If I do go and don‚Äôt end up presenting female I might wear something like a neon pink outfit just to be that person and call more attention to myself then if I had just worn a dress.
Having a good brother is wonderful, don't dismiss your family members without talking it thoroughly, if they can't accept you for who you are then it is not your fault, and then it is healthy to cut them out of your life so to not suffer negative influence that over time become more and more unbearable or worse.It seems to me that the brother is relative open minded, but he doesn't take his sister seriously at all, this is a huge problem that if ever they are to have good relationship they need to talk it out and the brother understand that this is as serious as it can get, it's his sisters true identity and as a brother he should accept her without any hesitation. If he doesn't then yeah don't bother at all, at least she did her part to salvage the sibling relationship, this is a crossroad that will determine if they will continue as friends or not, it's not to be taken lightly imo.
Some people wanna watch the world burn, and those are the people I like. You go, girl!
Neon pink ladies‚Äô suit? Hey, it‚Äôs not a dress! It‚Äôs a suit!"	12d2ptz	trans	540	0.99	2023-04-06 00:04:37
Wanna share your red-flags? What obvious trans warning-sign did you ignore growing up?	"**Big ole disclaimer to anybody in this thread that's ""questioning"" - YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A GIANT LIST OF TRANS-RED-FLAGS TO BE TRANS.** For me, personally, all of these memories remained safely buried until *well* *after* I realized I was trans. You may also just not have ""red flags"". And that's okay.

**Red flags I wrote off as ""totally normal"" growing up:**

* Regularly crying in the shower because I wasn't a girl. 10 years old.
* Queer people made me massively uncomfortable, likely because I had some deep-seated religious trauma. ""*How come they get to be happy and I have to be miserable and hate myself? They must be wrong, not my parents*"".
* Attended all-girls sleepover with one of my close female friends. They did my hair. I wasn't mad. Age 16. Still totally cisgender & straight.
* Wearing makeup for the first time during the high school musical and absolutely NOT wanting to take off the stage makeup / eyeliner, ever. I looked so good! I took selfies and hid them in a folder on my iPod touch. And yes I know this one is a double-whammy lol. 17 years old. *Very* cis.
* LOVED long hair. Literally cried when my parents made me get haircuts. Grew it out the second I turned 18.
* College years - close friend group & study group is 80% female. I feel massively uncomfortable around typical cis guys. Always felt like I had to put on a show to fit in with them. Always assumed they knew I was different. Always assumed it was normal to feel out of place among friends. Right? RIGHT?!
* Gender-swap snapchat selfie filters made me feel funny. I couldn't stop staring. Still didn't think anything of it though. 24 years old.
* A friend recommended I check out /r/egg_irl. Browsed it a few times, blissfully daydreaming about being female. Wishing I could be trans. But obviously I'm not trans, so I can't be trans. Logic checks out. On my way I went for **a few more years.**

The list goes on. What about yours? :)"	"We should do a trans bingo lmao
I screamed the first time I got my period. Not because I was scared, but because I was angry. 

My best friend would ""force"" me to play the guy roles when we were playing pretend as kids. I wasn't mad.

I ID'd as a major tomboy before my parents told me I had to be ladylike. I hated the dresses they made me wear before I was old enough to pick out my own clothes, and tended to ""accidentally"" tear them. 

My best friend (who was 5 at the time of the incident) cut my hair super short when we were playing hair salon. I wasn't upset until my parents got home qnd got upset. But secretly I was happy to have short hair, just like the boys.

Ah, growing up evangelical and trans. Repression central.
daydreaming about what I would do if I had to start my life from scratch. Always thought I would pose as a man (I‚Äôm ftm). 

I never really liked my name but couldn‚Äôt figure out why (my deadname is very femme)

always wanted to be one of the guys but felt terrible when excluded from them.

jealous of Mulan for being able to dress as a man
Oh God my entire life? But uh, here's the highlights:

When i was like 6 or 7, I got lice from daycare and I was livid that my brothers got to shave their heads and I had to go through lice treatments and combing ""just to keep my stupid hair""

At twelve, I genuinely thought every girl faked being excited to grow boobs because mine made me dissociate when I looked at them.

At fourteen, four years before I accepted that I was trans, I literally wrote in my journal ""Having one of those days where I feel like I'm a boy. I wonder when I'm going to stop having those""

At fifteen super late at night, I borrowed one of my brothers shirts, put on two sports bras and tucked all my hair under a beanie. I must have stared at myself in amazement for like twenty minutes until the shitty binding hurt and I had to take it off. 

At sixteen when my mom tried to force me not to cut my hair short, I went to my dad's and asked him to take me. I sobbed when the hair stylist wouldn't go any shorter than a bob. Got it cut down to a pixie cut a few months later and was over the moon.
Okay, I‚Äôve got a good bit I‚Äôve been re-remembering over the past couple months. 

- Feeling like my genitals were ‚Äústapled on‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt look right on me. I remember multiple  times standing in front of a full body mirror, tucking, and thinking ‚Äúnow this looks right‚Äù I was like 9 or 10 
- Straight up asked my mom to buy me bras when I was 11, she said no but I kept trying for like 15 minutes until I gave up
- I used to get a yearly buzz cut in the spring but stopped doing that when I was around 15 or 16, I was a big metal head at the time and my ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù for growing my hair out was windmill head banging, which I‚Äôve never actually done, and even at the time it felt like I was lying to myself. 
- Almost exclusively playing girl characters in video games for years (when I came out my ftm friend said he wanted to ask me about it cause he did the same thing, but he didn‚Äôt want it to be weird)
- Spontaneously getting my ears pierced when I was 19, didn‚Äôt tell my parents or anyone (of course boys can have pierced ears too btw)
- Pretending to hate girly things when I really enjoyed them (girly movies, girls toys, etc)
- Never feeling like my name quite fit, like even as a little kid I remember thinking that my name was just the name of this body I inhabited
- Putting balloons in my shirt and inflating them so it looked like I had boobs when I was like 7 to 11 years old
- Singing along to music by female artists but just mouthing the lyrics so I would think that her voice is my voice
- Right before I cracked I spontaneously shaved my face, I had the closest thing to a full beard I could grow (hair was around 1 inch in length, never got longer than that) and our electric razor was broken, so I shaved my face with a safety razor and it took like 45 minutes
- Always preferring to do stuff with my mom and sister, but I was always grouped up with my brother, which always annoyed me, that caused me and my brother to have a really rocky relationship for years 
- Sitting in the car waiting for my shift to start at my first job, I was thinking about gender and I came to the conclusion that I wasn‚Äôt a man, but I didn‚Äôt even entertain the possibility of being a woman, I distinctly remember thinking to myself ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be a girl, I‚Äôd make an ugly girl and I‚Äôd rather be an ugly guy than and ugly girl‚Äù and that was the closest I got to cracking.
- I boiled down all my insecurities and gender dysphoria into just me being fat. So when I started losing weight and everyone was congratulating me for looking better, I didn‚Äôt feel better, if anything it was worse. That started the final debate.
- During that final debate I remember fantasizing about suddenly being rich, and how the first thing I‚Äôd do is get on hrt and try and get srs, even though I was ‚Äústill totally cis‚Äù 

It took me until I was 21 for my egg to crack and I haven‚Äôt felt better (aside from my parents and siblings not respecting me). I have so many more but I just can‚Äôt think of them rn
Only liked my chest because of other people. Felt most comfortable with big shirts covering my chest to look flat chested. Felt uncomfortable with long hair. Didn‚Äôt mind my natural mustache. Big one here, got called a ‚Äúlittle boy‚Äù as an insult by someone and it didn‚Äôt bother me at all and was kinda cool my short hair made me look like that. Typical Tomboy. ‚ÄúSometimes I want to look pretty in like a boy way, like fem in a boy way‚Äù ‚Äúwait you guys don‚Äôt think about being a boy?‚Äù Yeahhh I should‚Äôve known
Mind If I steal the title of ur post? i wanna make one compiling chaser red flags
not sure if this is common but i felt it strange that i couldn't really make as much guy friends as i did girl friends, and i was just generally more open and friendly with other girls. back in middle school i thought it was romantic attraction (which kinda messed and ruined my psyche) but i found out too late that it was simply just me wanting to socialize with girls because i better related to them, me being a girl and all

also really loved long hair, currently rockin it
Having an imaginary male friend during adolescence, who would tell me ""don't worry, I'm you. Nobody can take me from you. At least in part you're a boy!"" 

I repressed him hard for a few years, then my egg cracked during the pandemic, and he came back one day. He was super smug about it. 

""See? I told you, I am you!"" And then he promptly disappear and I never saw him again.
- Never felt comfortable wearing pants/shorts no matter the size, shape, or material, just didn't feel right
- Preferred dresses, skirts, and feminine clothing in general to the point of daydreaming about wearing them
- Tried on dresses whenever parents weren't home
- Obsessed with makeup, jewelry, and toys/general products marketed towards girls
- Didn't mind being called ""Princess"" jokingly by my friends for months
- Looked up the cost of trans surgeries and treatments every day for a week (before even knowing that trans people existed)
- Wished that I'd somehow turn into a girl one day

And finally, for the Coup de Grace

- Looking up and getting advice on how to walk, talk, act, and dress like a girl and made plans to go to school like that everyday, it never happened

How did I miss ALL OF THAT!!!??
Ok so mine ain‚Äôt too much by as a kid I wanted to go in public without a shirt but my parents wouldn‚Äôt let me and I felt sad.
 One time I legitametly took off my shirt when I was a kid and it felt great then later irdk
my personal red flags (ftm)  
\-wanted less ""dainty"" feminine hands  
\-Got upset when my height stopped at 5'3    
\-Constantly hoping for a voice drop during puberty  
\-got upset when i didn't develop a noticeable Adams apple  
\-Lowkey hated my cis female friends when they were both past 5'5 and one had a natural Adams apple  
\- Was considered a tomboy (biggest hint right there)  
\- constantly pictured myself as male protagonists of my favorite cartoons and never the female ones  
\-cut my hair short as soon as I could  
\- literally wanted facial hair??? 

how did it take so long for me to figure out i wasn't cis
you all thought about that magic button didnt you
Hating to be called she 

Wanting to be in a male body just to see what it was like 

Getting a male friend to ‚Äúshow me‚Äù how they operate
""I'm not like other girls ü§™""
One big one for me was in school some girls wanted to do up my hair with bows and stuff and it made me
 so unbelievably happy. I just wore it like that for the rest of the day
When I was a kid I knew I‚Äôd prefer to be a girl and thought every boy felt that but just had to deal with the cards they were dealt 

I also always liked my hair super long and hated getting it cut and I felt really good when I‚Äôd get compliments from cis women on it

I was also super uncomfortable with queer people and even as a kid I knew it was because I was terrified that I might be one and how I would be treated if that were the case, not that I ever would have admitted that to anyone 

Absolutely did the same thing with the gender filters

There was a big one that I was actually going to post about a couple days ago, it‚Äôs right on the tip of my tongue but I just cannot for the life of me remember. 
In these situations I know the harder I try to remember the less likely it is I will so I‚Äôll just edit this later I guess lmao
I never cared much for men's style and hated most men's hair cuts
As a kid when I played with my best friends, I was always a boy. When I played a girl it felt completely boring and not fitting. My Minecraft Avatar was a boy. I hated dresses and with ten years I was so happy when I got short hair.
This is less of a redflag and was more like denial to me, even when I was little I always wanted to be a boy. 

I guess I kinda knew I was Trans from the beginning, lol.
-Every time i would get my period it was a constant fight to not go into the kitchen to stab myself in the abdomen in hopes i would damage my uterus so bad they had to take it out or id die (god ive been burying that one for a while)

-Screaming at god for blaming me for something i didnt even do and a gender i didn't want to be a part of

-Hoping one day everyone would get sterilized because if no one can have kids then maybe the gender roles wouldn't matter

-I gender swapped myself religiously. All my oc's could switch back to the way i looked before if i was in danger

-all my dreams where i turned into an animal were always the male version or a mix of both. which doesn't say anything really but the fact i woke up happy about it does say something

-would get a little indignant if people gave criticism on my leg hair (it has always been my pride even when i knew i had to shave it)

-trying to use plastic wrap to bind. (tried to ask my granma for help and then we had a big fight but she still wouldn't admit i was in pain)

-was angry when i couldnt be an adult before i got my period and when i learned that i got my first period mourned that i wouldn't ever be able to adult things ever. Little me i guess was worried about being a virgin and i have no idea way because i was like 11 and a half or 12 when I started. I wasn't even attracted to anyone but sex before being able to get pregnant was important to me for some reason? didnt even know what sex involved back then

-a few others obviously but those are the ones on the top of my head

You also said red flags so I put in all the ones that were dangerous or dangerous thinking. If it bothers anyone I will delete these
‚ÄúCan I get a happy meal with the boys toy and another one with a girl‚Äôs toy-

Oh wait, nevermind, can I get two boy toys?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs play house! We both can‚Äôt be the mommy though, so you can be my daughter! Oh, you wanna be the daddy? Okay!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be a farmer when you grow up, Deadname, that‚Äôs a boy‚Äôs job.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, Deadname! I‚Äôm dressed as Ariel for Halloween! Oh, you dressed as a ninja turtle? That‚Äôs so cool! Maybe you could save me from some bad guys!‚Äù

‚ÄúStop crying, Deadname, girls are supposed to grow breasts when they get older. You don‚Äôt want to have a flat chest forever, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDeadname, stop stealing your brother‚Äôs clothes! I bought you a perfectly good dress for you to wear to church.‚Äù

Etc, etc
  Was forced into over the top femininity until the 8th grade (hair bows, skirts, sparkles, Justice clothes, dresses) As a little kid cried that I couldn‚Äôt be a boy and play in the mud cause mom would yell at me for getting clothes dirty.

Cried that I couldn‚Äôt be a boy because being a boy meant being happy
-Litterly saying I would be a boy in my next life
-Wanting to scream at people of they used my full name and not a nickname
-I said I would never want to wear a bra
-Saying I would weather change in the boys locker room
-Not wanting to be moved when the teacher accidentally put me with a group of boys
-Used to get in fights with my mother about being shirtless in public (I was like 8 btw)
-Oh yeah when playing house I always played like a bug or sum to avoid being the sister.
Hated being grouped with the girls, doing anything feminine, just because I wanted to be more like a guy. Identified soooo much with the term tomboy because it was the closest thing I knew to trans (I only figured out that people can be trans in middle school, that was when my egg cracked). Hated every part of puberty. Didn‚Äôt like growing breasts, didn‚Äôt like ‚Äúbecoming a woman‚Äù
How about literally hating the feeling of your you-know-what existing?

Also hating haircuts. Pretty much had to be bribed nearly every single time
Early on in my puberty, my mom caught me using her razor to shave my legs. I didn't have any words for why I did it except that I didn't like that there was hair growing everywhere. I also asked her on a few occasions what my name would've been if I were born a girl. And during family gatherings, I would hang around her and my aunts instead of around my dad and uncles.

18 years later, when I finally figured it all out and came out to her, I got the classic ""bUt ThErE wErE nO sIgNs"".
I wouldn't say I ignored signs, so much as there were a lot of things I ignored because I didn't understand what it meant, or how serious it was.

Wanting to be dominated by boys at 6.

Feeling demure around masculine people at 7

Wanting Barbies, or at least female GI Joe figures at 8

Playing girl character in video games 10.

Cr0ssdressing at 12.

Stealing mom's makeup at 13

Sleeping with a bra on at 14

Fascination with Rule 63 or Gender bending at 15.

Online role-playing as ""my girl version"" at 16.

Being fascinated by a documentary about transitioning at 17.

Feeling a mental separation between masculine and feminine in my head. 18

LARPing as female characters with my partner. 20...
Being a ""lesbian"" online so guys wouldn't want to date me. 21

Having an online boyfriend at 25. (He never knew I was trans, and we broke up after a year when he let my character die in RP so that his character could go back to his EX)

Doing random sexting with guys as various girl characters just to sometimes feel like a woman... 27-34

Realizing I'd literally been wh*ring myself online. 35

And then I started transitioning.
here are my red flags ( I don't know my gender yet but I still wanted to participate) 

&#x200B;

I used to avoid being masculine because I thought I'd like it too much and then I'd stop wanting to be a girl.

 When I found out I could starve away my period I was ecstatic.

 I would have panic attacks anytime someone called me curvy.

 I used to relate more to male characters. 

I felt jealous that trans men had ""nice voices"" and that I didn't. 

I thought I wanted to be a woman but felt anxious when seen as a girl.

 When I got my period I felt disgusting and I wanted to pretend it didn't exist. 

My mom also told me every woman as a child didn't want to grow up to be a woman.

 When I found out I could starve away my period I was ecstatic.

&#x200B;

(this is just some but how did I think I was cis lmao???
ever since i was a kid I would cringe (or at least get very confused, like 404 not found) everytime people addressed me by she/her pronouns, and sometimes i had no idea. 

plus something i noticed when i came out for my late father: I told him my name and he snapped ""since you were a kid you were always ""looking for another names"". and indeed, I always hated my deadname bc  (my words) ""it doesn't fits me, i always picture a a very spoiled and girly girl"".
For context, I‚Äôm transmasc and NB. Growing up, the concept of being non-binary simply did not exist yet, at least not in my world. I knew I didn‚Äôt want to be a boy, but also didn‚Äôt feel like a girl. At that time, I had no explanation, besides that I was just weird and wrong. My list:

Never liking my name and feeling like it was meant for a different person.

Thinking all girls faked liking girl things and would also rather be doing boy things. There were just rules we had to follow to fit in.

Convincing my brother that we should trade underwear (I was like 7 years old). I just wanted to know what it was like!

Feeling euphoria whenever I cut my hair really short. 

Loving stories about ‚Äúimposters‚Äù - especially the ones where a woman pretended to be a man. I had a book on the topic as a kid and read it multiple times.

Learning about intersex conditions and wondering if I could be intersex without knowing it.

My mom telling me she thought I was going to be born a boy so she had a boy name picked out and was surprised when I wasn‚Äôt. I remember thinking maybe I should have been born a boy, but something went wrong.

Being deeply ashamed when I got my first period and trying to hide it from everyone. Also, being resistant to wearing a bra when most girls my age had already started wearing one. It just felt like a inconvenience, nothing I wanted to do.
Hmm‚Ä¶ 

1. I was in dance classes as a kid. Didn‚Äôt want to do the ballet ones, and during the recitals I threw tantrums because I had to wear dresses and makeup. 
2. I showered very rarely, because I hated looking at my body. I still do, as I haven‚Äôt had top surgery yet.
3. Always hated girls/women‚Äôs clothing. I wore stuff that was more gender neutral/masculine once I was in high school and nothing else. 
4. When I got my period, I straight up said ‚ÄúI want to die‚Äù to my mom. Not kidding. 
5. I always wished I had a deeper voice. From the age of like 8 or 9.
Trans lesbian here. Ah yes. 

The awkward socialization, behaving like someone else all the time. Not knowing why you never fit in with 'other boys'. I used to act stupid to fit in. I used to have anxiety/panic attacks when I'd hang out with 'other boys' my age.

I always liked having longer hair. I hated typically masculine clothes: anything with skulls or flames, especially tank tops.

Most of my early friendships I chose to form myself were with girls, and the games and things we did were fun. I remember a certain point in grade school where the girls and guys stopped playing together and felt disheartened at that time.

Growing up I had a little brother who I absolutely adored and sometimes hated lol. I used to help clean up after him, put him to bed sing songs or make up stories for him and I to play. I'm not trying to stereotype but most big brothers just beat their little brothers up which I never did.

I despised puberty, at the time I thought this was normal and everyone hated the changes they were going through. I started trying on my mom's clothes in secret around 12-13. I thought I was sexually perverted or messed up (likely based on what I was taught about trans people at the time my household used to be pretty transphobic). I never forgot how dressing up made me feel good though.

Not to mention crushing on trans and queer people in high school. Also maybe a guy too, who happened to be in my gym class lol.

I repressed myself and my personality for years until I learned trans people were legit real people. On the same day, I: learned trans people were valid, learned about transition, AND learned I was trans lesbian. I learned this because I had a trans friend online, I reviewed my life my personality what makes me me, also reviewed my past crushes who were almost exclusively all queer/lesbian.
(Mtf here) Only ever had girl friends growing up, never felt like ""one of the guys"" never liked stereotypical guy fashion, always daydreaming about wearing dresses and looking like the girls but ""Im a cis straight guy, i like girls, so that's totally normal"" üíÄ and for all the gamers out there, NEVER picking a male character if ever given the option. When questioned why I could never give any answer aside from ""Just feels right? Always been the"" Mother"" of my friend groups and always took great pride in it, and always felt so sad when I wasn't included in ""girls nights""

4 years later dating the woman of my dreams and 6 months into HRT I can finally start living the life I want to üíñ it gets better yall.
Still questioning but am pretty far in the process by now (MtF). Tough to deal with but here are some red flags I‚Äôve noticed thinking back:

The trigger for everything: Finding out back in January that HRT and SRS are a thing and seeing how far you can transition. Forced open all doors that I had sealed.

- Ever since I started puberty, I‚Äôve been ‚Äúchecking myself out‚Äù in the mirror (curves). 

- Always feel much more secure in myself with long hair.

- Hate being ‚Äúbig‚Äù and ‚Äústrong-looking‚Äù and was way happier being thin as a 15/16-year old. Currently training my ass off to lose weight.

- back when I didn‚Äôt know transgender was a thing, I would write femboy self-insert fanfics. Been doing that for 8 years+. Recently started writing more transgirl/girl fanfics.

- Back when I was 12/13, I had a ‚Äúbicurious‚Äù relationship with my best friend. I would always see myself as the girl, and hoped he did too. When it ended and he got a girlfriend, I drowned it all and moved on. Still haven‚Äôt recovered.

- Always felt like the odd one out in male-groups, and felt that I didn‚Äôt fit in female-groups either. Forced myself to become the class clown to deal with it. Nowadays, I sit alone, and feel like I can‚Äôt ‚Äúfunction‚Äù like everyone else.

- Grew up transphobic. Some parental influence but honestly more because I knew it resonated with me.

Recent signs:
- Faceapp. Used it way too much and even paid for the premium twice to feminize myself. I feel euphoric every time.

- Tried mascara, Felt euphoric as fuck. Same with bras

- Shaved off my ‚Äúdenial beard‚Äù. Not much since I‚Äôm only 18 but still felt pretty good about it.

Tl:dr. I feel like shit lol.
For context, I am transfem nonbinary (demigirl I guess?) 

I was raised in a conservative Christian household and was not accepted by my parents

-I hated that my parents forced me to have short hair

-Wished I was born a girl since the age of 8 or so

-Had very soft skin, soft hair, long eyelashes, and weak muscles

-When I started to grow facial hair, I would pluck it out even though it hurt. I guess that was some sort of gender affirming self harm

-Loved painting my nails

-Constantly played as girls in video games and D&D

-Loved singing high pitched songs

-Used to be a femboy and got really happy when I wore thigh highs, panties, and skirts
Haha I love this question. (FTM)

* Wrote a story about jack frost from rise of the guardians where I was jack frost.
* Refused to wear any sort of make-up type thing on my face, for school productions I refused to even wear lip balm because it made me too uncomfortable.
* Only wore girls gym shorts as underwear bc anything else made me too uncomfortable.
* Mainly hung out with guys, felt uncomfortable around girl friends
* Hated skirts and dresses, never wore them. Only wore a skirt in school sometimes.
* Only got clothes from the boys sections in stores when I was allowed.
* Begged my mum every year to let me get my hair cut short. Cut off my own hair bad when I was 12 or something so that she'd have to take me to the hairdressers to get it fixed and shorter.
* Only acting as the boy characters, or choosing those to act as (if that makes sense).
* Unhealthy obsession with batman and spiderman
When I was 5 or 6 I would always tuck when I sat down to pee.

I would always ask myself stuff like ""if I were a girl, who wouldn't I date"" in 2nd grade (for a while I interpreted this one as a gay red flag) 

I would always choose the girl characters in games, but I would feel really weird about it, but in a good way.

I was a fat kid, but I really liked having boobs. 

In 3rd grade I really wanted a lala loopsy doll for Xmas

In middle school I let my friends do my makeup because it made me feel pretty, but I was in hella denial back then
Some of the bigger ones

* When I was maybe around age 10 (it's hard to pinpoint exactly when), I described myself as being ""feminine-minded."" I didn't mean this in a ""oh I'm girly"" way. I literally thought I had a woman's brain in me.
* I would join random chats on omegle and present myself as a woman when having conversations with random strangers, and I always felt really good in doing so.
* I had a several week long relationship with someone online who knew I was AMAB, but was only attracted to women, and so just had me/let me pretend to be female the entire time. When that relationship suddenly broke off, I was extremely depressed because of the opportunity I had lost.
* Part of the above involved being told at one point that I must have been a woman in a past life, or that my soul has that sort of experience because they often would forget that I was AMAB. This felt really good at the time but I didn't quite know why.
* I have apparently on multiple occasions talked to my partner about how much I hate my genitals, and on at least one occasion said that I'd rather not have them. This was all very cisgendered, of course.

There's a lot more minor stuff, like creating female characters in games, other online situations where I presented as a woman, etc. I also very heavily come from the ""enthusiastic ally to trans person"" pipeline.
I asked my dad to take me to the doctor to get my gender checked (age 4) bc I thought the F on my birth certificate was a mistake
I just discovered I‚Äôm probably trans a few days  ago when I tried on a dress and bra to do drag, I didn‚Äôt want to take it off and it made me feel good. Did some soul searching and here I am.
90% of my tween years was spent wishing I had breasts.
Thinking about changing my name to something ‚Äúless girly‚Äù at like 13. Wanting to keep my hair VERY short from an early age. Feeling uncomfortable with my chest as soon as I hit puberty. Only ever liking skorts (as the furthest I‚Äôd go toward a skirt/dress). Only ever presenting as femme for male attention. Hating bras.
 -I was a fan of Lady Gaga from the first time I heard her music

 -I *always* hated getting my picture taken.

 -You couldn‚Äôt catch me dead willingly taking my shirt off, even to swim. 

 -Hearing my dad mock Caitlyn Jenner (recounting having gone to school with her and misgendering her) hurt way more than expected, and resulted in me never telling my parents how I felt about my gender.

 -I was raised unhealthily religious, when my AGAB puberty started I would spend my nights praying tearfully to the god above to let me wake up as a girl, and immediately check when I woke up in the morning.

 -After giving up and accepting a life of misery as the wrong gender, I always got envy from encountering someone who had transitioned.  (Note that for the longest time, due to my severely sheltered upbringing, I didn‚Äôt even know that transgender existed. I thought the closest anyone could get was by getting lucky by being born intersex.  I was severely confused.)
There‚Äôs a bunch but off the top of my head 

Dreading the onset of puberty

Only playing female characters 

Oh yeah when I was 8-12 I desperately wanted to be a girl
Mostly interested in music targeted for a female fan base.
Much more interested in Women‚Äôs clothing and fashion.
Wanting to grow my hair long and wear makeup.
Wishing that, after my family went to bed, I could magically turn into a girl and do girl things whatever I thought that meant at the time.
Always pretending to be a girl when playing games like: House while growing up. 
Strong urges to wear my female relatives clothing.


I‚Äôm not out. Yet. But I am really working hard to develop the courage to do it.
when I was just out as gay we were watching these videos that my dad used to record of us when we were younger. In one of them I was wearing a dress. I was probably like six or seven. Still didn‚Äôt figure it out for another year and a half.
I always played female D&D characters. My friends called me pervy but I didn't care.
Made a Scribblehub account specifically to follow a bunch of trans wish fulfillment stories about people magically getting turned into girls almost a full year before actually cracking my egg.
getting involved in super toxic yaoi lover communities (which were mostly female) and crying because i couldn't date guys in a gay way
Wanted to have a shapeshift power so I could turn into a girl lol
Had a dream when I was like 3 years old that I was a girl and playing in a pile of leaves with my sister. Towards the end of the dream my hair fell off like it was a wig and suddenly I felt like a boy and got really sad. One of my earliest memories and it never occurred to me that that might‚Äôve meant anything until recently.
Many times as a child, I'd try and shove stuff in my pants and pretend it was a penis. I also remember crying a lot when my breasts started growing. I cut my hair short at twelve and was really happy when people thought I was a boy. When I joined choir in grade 10, my voice was deep enough for me to sing tenor, and when my teacher would call the group 'boys' collectively, I was pretty happy about that too. A year after that my teacher put me as a soprano and I completely broke down due to being called a girl and having to use my head voice all the time. It was only then I realized, ""oh no, I'm not cis"" but then still questioned for another 6 months.
Im MtF. So looking back now I relies that it might have been more then a red flag, but I enjoyed dressing up in feminine clothing, such as when I was 12 I enjoyed dressing in my sisters Cinderella dress. I also put on my mums makeup and put on my mums heels which made me feel happy. I also found my self wondering what it would be like to be female a lot like a lot. I still have a lot of impostor syndrome tho so that‚Äôs fun lol.
I grew up w short hair. A couple of older neighborhood kids would tease me and say I looked like a boy. I remember getting huffy and insisting I'm not, but it felt forced. I didn't really mind being called a boy but it almost felt like I was supposed to insist I was a girl
""don't really wanna put she/her pronouns in my bio. that's just cause I want to be careful online though, right?"" news flash, dumbass: THAT'S NOT THE REASON
I changed my name to my initials (Mac) ever since I realized they made a name. From age 7 to 16 I used it, and hated my old name because it was too feminine. I specifically remember making fun of myself when I was younger as I talked to my trans friends. (Young me had all queer friends with only one exception. Still thought I was hetero though!) I remember saying (birthname) ‚Äúwas my deadname, but I‚Äôm not trans.‚Äù (At the time I thought the term only applied to trans people.)
Was waiting for my ‚Äúnext life‚Äù so I can be born as a guy. Realized that I can just have it now.
When I was younger I wished I looked like characters that were male
- I was jealous of clownfish because they changed their gender and seahorses because the men became pregnant
- I had an argument with myself as a child where I convinced myself I had to be a boy because my parents already had girl children
- I never minded when my sisters did my hair or makeup, even when it looked ridiculous
- Wishing to be reincarnated as a girl
- Asking my friend group at secondary school whether they would take the opportunity to turn into a girl if it was presented to them (and then being massively surprised when they all said no)
- not really having any fashion sense until University (and liked it that way ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not vain like other people), and then only getting one because I wanted to look as pretty as some of the girls in my classes
- Usually I make friends with girls first in new settings and then settle with a boy group; some of my closest friends are girls (or at least I thought they were girls when I made friends with them)
- asking for a skirt for my 20th bday and having everyone be into that idea, only for it to be shut down by my mum (and then feeling really bad about it)
- not being sure about what gender I would pick if I were given an option
- always feeling like masculinity was bad and restrictive, wishing that men weren‚Äôt so caught up with not looking feminine
- Always wanting to pick girl characters in video games but ended up choosing a male one; whenever I chose a girl character always feeling excited and weird.
- always growing my hair out as long as possible before someone made me cut it. Always feeling bad at how I looked after a haircut
- now that I have long hair panicking whenever people talk about cutting it, panicking about the thought of losing it as my hairlines been maturing/receeding since I was 15/16
- just being envious of women in general, they way they look, the way they make friends real easy
- always played the more stereotypically feminine roles in video games (support, healer, etc. - this is kinda a sexist point but I‚Äôm counting it).
- hating my facial and body hair; hated shaving my face
- being super into any media with gender bender/ transformation themes

I‚Äôm sure the list goes on
Well, I grew up in a conservative, Christian, right wing, household so I didn't even have words for it until I went to college, BUUUUUTTTTT...

I felt more comfortable working at a girl scout camp than a boy scout camp or even just regular troop activities.
I felt closer to my mother doing traditionally, ""feminine,"" things.

I felt perfectly comfortable doing crossdressing type dares. 

I wanted to play flute. Then clarinet. Both ideas where shot down as, ""not manly enough and will get you picked on."" 

During band trips in high school, color guard girls would pin down male band members and go ABSOLUTELY WILD with makeup. Talking glitter around the eyes, watermelon scented spray that def said it was not perfume (don't remember that it was calling in the early 2000s), THE WORKS. Always hinted that I was fine with this and an, ""easy target."" Was salty I never got targeted. 

Um... that's all I can remember off the top of my head.
OMG I FORGOT ABOUT THE SNAPCHAT THING! I always thought that i was just unlucky that i didnt show any ‚Äúsigns while i was younger‚Äù to bring up with my parents but some of these genuinely fit me!
I wanna attend an all girls sleepover please share your secret
Always liked people in media crossdressing. Although I'd later get jealous of the fact that they get to feel like themselves and I don't.

Wished that I could trade bodies with any girl who'd be interested in the trade. 

Wished I could have a higher voice or at least change from one to the other. 

Wished all body hair would smite itself from existence. 

Hated all facial hair

Desperately wish my penis would just magically go away.

Wished I could move schools, dress up as a girl and just claim I had some sort of problem that made my voice so much deeper

Was annoyed when girls talked about periods because it always felt like something that was missing from my body and my life

Loved wearing wigs or anything that made my hair seem longer. Also gender swap filters were the best

Wished I could be reborn in a girls body but with all my memories and go through a girls childhood and puberty. 

Crossdressed for a play when I was 16. Egg shattered. Got on HRT two months ago at 17. Currently sitting dealing with period cramps (because trans women do get those and I wish people had told me). Growing boobs and just started getting hips and I couldn't be happier for it. I know I've made the right decision and that's the final sign
Off the top of my head:

‚ñ™Ô∏éAlways wearing a swimming shirt when I was taught to swim back when I was around 9 or 10 (still hate swimming to this day)

‚ñ™Ô∏é Whilst in the changing rooms I always felt really uncomfortable and awkward around the other boys so I had to change in a cubicle.

‚ñ™Ô∏éHated and still do hate being shirtless any time for even the shortest amount of time, always makes me feel so naked and exposed and it also meant both myself and other people had to see my flat chest, was really envious of women getting to wear bras.

‚ñ™Ô∏é I don't necessarily feel uncomfortable with other guys but I am never open to my male friends that much but my female friend (also my best friend) I trust so much and feel so comfortable and open with her, like I actually feel somewhat like myself with her.

‚ñ™Ô∏é Used to (and admittedly still do sometimes) stuff things under my shirt to make it look like I have breasts, most of the time I'd form my hands into fists then put  my hands up my shirt then place them on my chest to get a sense of what having breasts would feel like.

‚ñ™Ô∏é Having this absolutely extreme urge to want to dress in typically feminine clothes like skirts, dresses, thigh-highs, leggings, crop-tops, short shorts, panties, bras and just about any other item of clothing under the sun.

‚ñ™Ô∏éTrying my best to get a super high pitched feminine voice while playing Ghost of Tsushima then blushing and smiling when I do it well enough (very niche ik lol).

‚ñ™Ô∏é Sometimes wanting to literally be girls that I see in like some random picture or like anywhere else random, as well as being jealous of feminine features that I don't have.

‚ñ™Ô∏é The first time I ever dressed in feminine clothes, when I saw my reflection I just stared at myself, jaw-dropped and I literally collapsed, I kid you not I fell to the ground and onto my knees, just staring at myself repeating ""That's me! Oh my god that's me!"" Which y'know is a perfectly cis reaction, I mean what guy doesn't fall onto their knees while being consumed in an overwhelming amount of euphoric emotions at the sight of themselves in short shorts and a crop-top right?

‚ñ™Ô∏éAlways try to do anything effeminately, observing the way girls do things and doing that and observing boys doing something and avoiding doing something like that.

‚ñ™Ô∏éWhen I was a little kid I was (and admittedly still kind of am) obsessed with mermaids, from what little I remember of that early on The Little Mermaid and Jurassic Park where my two most watched VHS tapes. I used to be so jealous watching TLM just absolutely dying to be a mermaid (probably me justifying wanting to be a girl and using mermaid as a compromise instead, not like there's much of a difference there but still) like I vividly remember everything kid me did to look and act like the characters, I vividly remember trying to recreate that famous rock scene with Aerial as a kid. I eventually grew out of my mermaid obsession but it never truly left and after cracking my egg it's starting to come back again.

‚ñ™Ô∏éAlso as a kid (and even now at 16 to be fair) never fit in that well with the boys at school, I was sensitive and loved to stay clean (stereotypically feminine behaviour) whilst most of the other boys rolled around in dirt and wrestled with each other (stereotypically masculine behaviour).

‚ñ™Ô∏éAbsolutely hating the boys vs girls segregation stuff that went on alot as kids, whenever that happened I'd either try and stay with the girls or not bother at all unless it was mandatory.

‚ñ™Ô∏éDid countless ""Am I Trans?"" And Gender Dysphoria quizzes.

‚ñ™Ô∏éIdentified and related to lots of Gender Dysphoria feelings.

‚ñ™Ô∏éHad a huge mental breakdown over the fact I wasn't a girl the other day.

‚ñ™Ô∏éAlso just the other day my Mum was doing my hair (not out to her yet) and she jokingly said she was going to put it in a pony tail and I was literally screaming in joy inside and smiling, I didn't want to say anything because I wanted to get a hint across I'm trans and also saying no would make her think I wouldn't want that to happen but I'd literally die of happiness if it did. She then said something like if only she had a hair clip she could use to give me as it would come in handy. This is probably because of my fairly long hair, I think she was joking but I literally almost cried tears of joy, like something as small as the mentioning of giving me a hair clip just made me so happy and I tried so hard not to show it.
Trans woman here. When I was a kid I played a ton of MMOs and everyone knew me as a girl. I never really even played the game. I just hung out in these zones designed for hanging out and talking. Looking back I'm not sure if I was addicted to them or if I was just chasing that euphoria before I even knew what it was. All I know is that after I stopped playing I really missed being a girl. Somehow it took me another decade to figure out why I missed it so much lol. At least I eventually got there.
\-constantly compared boys to girls when I was little and decided that being a boy was obviously better

\-never felt like I fit in with the girls, and I wished I could hang out with the boys instead

\-thought that if I was a boy, I wouldn't have social anxiety

\-when I learned about trans people, I thought it was really cool until my transphobic mom told me it was wrong to be trans

\-got way too much joy 'pretending' to be a boy online

\-had dreams where I was a boy, as well as daydreams, and when I tried to be a girl in my daydreams, it felt wrong

\-would make jokes about how I was born a girl because if I was a boy my dad jokes would be too powerful so god nerfed me

\-have hated my deadname since as long as I can remember
Well, quite a few, but the most relevant I'm comfortable sharing is the way my deadname made me feel.

I have a disorder that makes me have really bad memory, so they had to teach me my deadname in a different way: my mother showed me pizza, said my deadname and I had to repeat it. Since then, I know that they wanted me to relate to that name as mine, but I just related it to pizza.

To sum up, I didn't think that my name fitted me, I was just uncomfortable with it, but I wanted to eat pizza.
i always tried to pee like a boy, sometimes sitting on the toilet backwards.

always had male and female friends, but always wanted to fit in with the guys more. 

i don‚Äôt have many but i always knew something was off.

also i read lots of mlm things and always wanted to be in a gay relationship, but not as a lesbian. i‚Äôm now pansexual and dating a gorgeous trans girl
I use to wear my moms clothes when I was younger, and always pick girl characters in games because it felt like I could enjoy the game more
Ever since I was like 12 or so, I kept having re-occurring dreams where I was transformed into a girl one way or another.

Onetime, when I was little, I looked at myself in the mirror and asked myself ‚Äúwhat if I was always a girl, but was forced to live a life as a boy?‚Äù

I never had a normal sexual development. When I first heard of the fact that people touch themselves, my thought was >!‚ÄùI‚Äôd rather take a knife and cut it off!‚Äù!< and that thought has consistently been a thing for ~4 years prior to me realizing that I am trans‚Ä¶
I literally used to sneak into my mom‚Äôs room when she was busy to wear her clothes at like eight years old and then continued to ignore the fact that I would do gender affirming things throughout my childhood after coming out as trans TWICE and then because there was a bad reaction from my family I retreated into a shell and ‚Äúdecided‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt trans which resulted in me not having emotions for two years. I‚Äôm beginning to realize that there‚Äôs no fucking way in hell that I‚Äôm not trans if I‚Äôve been doing that since being a small child and couldn‚Äôt deal with having emotions if I wasn‚Äôt being myself. Life is wack.
From a very young age I always loved long hair and specifically having flowers in it. Also every time my younger sister ‚Äúdid‚Äù my hair I liked it. Wearing braids hair bands pink nails etc. I also always had the urge to pick the female options in games and was always discouraged from these things because of friends. Well not because of them more like I felt uncomfortable being myself around them cause those red flags I mentioned where considered weird at the time and I didn‚Äôt want to be weird. Idk I got better friends now and I actually came out to them recently. Unbelievably supportive all of them <3
Having a strange obsession with link from LoZ and quite literally wanting to be him. It was very much a ‚Äúam I attracted to this or do I just have gender envy‚Äù moment. Same with rainbow dash from MLP.
Bragging about how I looked more similar to my dad than my mom and telling everyone around me about the time my grandma thought a photo of me as a toddler was a photo of my dad as that age (7)

Having a friendgroup of mostly men and get happy when they invited me to guys only plans or included me on ""guys"" talk because they said I was like one of the boys for them (12 to 15)

Having the ""maybe if I was a guy"" thought all the time even if the situation wouldn't change at all

My friend coming out as a trans man like 2 years ago and me thinking ""wish that was me"" (yes i didn't realize it back then it took me this whole 2 years after that, i'm dumb)

I always had more atraction to gay shows or books than saphic stories even though i was supposed to be more interested in those as a bi girl (and i felt guilty because girls around me were obssesed with bl and lowkey fetishized it and i thought i was doing the same thing)

Oh and when i did theater as a teen there was more girls than boys in our group so we decided that those who didn't mind changed with the boys in their room so everyone could have more space, guess who always offered to change there but thought nothing of it
I have a bad meory so what i can remember is being really finine and thinking its rlly cool(since forever), wanting to look like Amy Lee (like 9 or 10) and thinking i was a guy with a female soul (13 or 14)
Lack of Identity and starting puberty at 11 which was very off putting for me. (Breast Buds)
* Going to a science museum and seeing a ""pregnancy sympathy belly"" being worn and wanting to try it but too scared to ask
* as a very little kid, folding *certain skin portions* over my AMAB anatomy and seeing it appear flat and thinking about how ""nobody could guess whether I'm a boy or girl based on this""
* seeing another boy go to a high school dance in a dress and wanting to do the same, but too scared to ask about it
* the biggest clue of all, seriously it's embarrassing I didn't figure this out sooner: creating a fursona who had shapeshifting powers and regularly used them to alter his/her/their genitals, swapping pronouns on a whim. This more than TWO DECADES before deciding to call myself genderfluid (though in my defense, I did not know the word ""genderfluid"" *existed* back then).
* A friend sketching gender-swapped versions of fursonas of our little college furry circle, I asked why femme-me was covering her crotch with her tails, and he said because I'd mentioned something about wanting to be both a boy and a girl and he didn't feel comfortable drawing that anatomy, but would imply it if it made me happy.

There's much more, but that's all I'm comfortable sharing publicly right now. And I'm not counting the signals that directly led up to my big coming out to myself and others, like playing Celeste and hitting the part where >!an NPC repeatedly refers to the player character as ""Ms. \[name you entered\]"" and ""she"" and ""her""!< and then going to bed to try talking about myself as a girl, speaking imaginary dialogues to myself that refer to myself as ""she"" and ""her"", trying out how it felt. Realizing that just because I like being a boy doesn't mean I can't *also* like being a girl, and not just in roleplay.
For me it's 
‚Ä¢refused to go into the women's clothing section and would only accept going into the men's 
‚Ä¢being very upset I there wasn't an option to choose a male playable character in video games, often to the point of dropping the game all together (unless the gender of the character wasn't specified then it was cool)
‚Ä¢not getting why I wasn't allowed to swim without a shirt like my cis male cousins 
‚Ä¢classic ""not like other girls""/""I'm just a tomboy"" deal
‚Ä¢absolutely despised my high femme first and middle deadnames
‚Ä¢always referred as myself as a ""dude"" or ""man"" as in a ""I'm just a funny little man"" type of thing
‚Ä¢always hated my voice and hearing myself in recordings, as well as hating pics of myself or seeing myself in the mirror
‚Ä¢hated weddings n stuff specifically because that's one of the few times I was forced to wear a dress and didn't get why I couldn't wear a suit like the boys did.
‚Ä¢always strived to do the more manual labor stuff bc ""it's what the boys do"" (the boys referring to my male cousins)

And my list is longer than I thought before wow lol.
Photos. I HATED to have to look at myself in any situation, which is why I went about ruining any picture I had to be in so they wouldn t get put up. 

Also hated my boobs

and my name but a lot of cis people do that too

Didn't have many signs, but I'm also fluid so yeah
the middle school fujoshi to gay trans man pipeline is real
-thought that my (dead) name was genderless and that I would be called the same if I was the other way around (I was so wrong lol) 4 years old 

-always enjoyed playing and seeing girl related content like dress up games, Pucca. It made me feel very happy and very nervous if someone finded out
6 years old

-day dreamed with having long hair, I brushed my mom hair when I could, i did a messy job but I tried

12 year old

-COMED OUT OF THE CLOSET LMAO

-University helps me with my ID and changes my name so it fits my real name
18 years old

-buying make up and getting boobs this year

When I was a little kid, I had long hair, painted my nails, loved pink, and mostly had female friends.

When I was a bit older than that, I had a fascination with media in which people transformed into the other sex (e.g., the German film ""Hilfe, ich ich bin ein Junge"", or the manga ""Ranma ¬Ω"").

When I was 22 I realised I was trans.

When I was 25 (I think) I told my parents. They were (mostly) supportive, but rather surprised.
- fantasizing from since I was around 10 to transition into a woman after hearing it was possible (still cis tho haha!)

- general loss of energy and lack of care put into how I look/act/care for myself most likely due to dysphoria without knowing it

- obsessed with gender swap stories/au‚Äôs/headcanons

- I went suspiciously very far with gender swap jokes (one where I ‚Äúpretended‚Äù to become a girl after a quiz said male was incorrect and gender swapped every picture for the next few days and one time where I was joking about being super crowned and even when people said I didn‚Äôt have to continue the joke I did anyway)

- couldn‚Äôt stop using the female FaceApp and Snapchat filters

- Used to love Tinker Bell, Frozen, and other ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù forms of entertainment (in quotes because they don‚Äôt actually have a gender, anyone can enjoy anything :D) but started having an overexagerated hatred toward them which was actually just repression  of my feminine side (sorry if that made no sense I‚Äôm not good with words lol)

- haircuts have always been the f-cking WORST

- not really a sign but the doctors predicted I was going to be afab but was amab by surprise so that‚Äôs kinda a neat coincidence lol
I wrote an entire debate about how being a girl would be better. I had points like girls have better fashion choices, and they got to wear make up without judgment! I couldn't see how anyone could have thought differently üòÇ
When I was like 4 or 5 I used to steal my sister's gymnastics leotard and run around the house with it (I only vividly remember one instance, but my mom insists that this was a *frequent* occurrence lol).

I used to steal my sister's clothes when I was home alone. Started when I was about 11 and continued until my sister moved out to go to college. 

Bought a pair of skinny jeans online when I was in junior high. It felt amazing when I'd wear them, and I still remember how amazing it felt when I realized that I owned *something* feminine. 

Daydreamed and actually journaled about wishing I could buy ""girl"" and ""boy"" pills so I could be a girl when no one was home. 

Frankly this is a short list, I'm leaving out a lot üòÖ

.....


Still 138% cis though.
Wanting to hang out with the boys in the neighborhood, but only being allowed to play with the girls (and so just played alone because the girls were boring)

Couldn't date because I felt super creeped out and gross whenever a guy wanted to call me his girlfriend. This continued into adulthood, leading to me being 31 and never having been on more than 3 dates with the same person because I'm still not fully out.

Being secretly really happy when the obviously gay boy in my 7th grade class asked me to marry him. Even if it was a joke, it was beautiful. We were ""married"" at lunch and ""divorced"" over recess. (He didn't come out until high school, but he had been so bad at hiding it we all were like ""yeah, we know"")

Getting SUPER depressed about my body and having no idea why to the point where I had to spend some time in the hospital.

Probably others but these are the standouts, lol
I've mentioned a few of mine previously, but some I don't think I've shared:

- took home ec instead of woodshop, for the sewing and cooking

- female avatar in video games

- female (cartoony) avatar on social media accounts

- started wearing my hair long in ~9th grade (parents, surprisingly, only had one rule: ""keep it neat and clean"")

- got my ears pierced (twice) as soon as I could do so without needing my parents' permission

- Emphatically did *not* ""get along with"" the boys in my school year, but didn't know how to try to make friends with the girls either.
When I was 10, with my first mobile phone (2001, one of those little Nokia bricks. Black and orange monotone screen), I called up a sex ed helpline with the intent to ""prank call"" them on how to get a sex change operation.

I chickened out halfway through the first sentence when I realised it wasn't a prank.

Was still cis though.
from a very young age i had almost all female friends, my parents wrote it off as the typical cishet bullshit about how i'm a player or whatever.

my parents made me wear swimshirts when i was young and i was uncomfortable how they clung to me, especially my chest (this was around the time my female classmates started puberty)

i would pretend i was looking at a girl in the mirror (not myself, at this point) and pretend to tuck my hair behind my ear (my dad cut it short for YEARS and still tries to get me to cut it short)

i decided to try and grow my hair out in the 5th grade and got obsessed with getting it long enough to put in a little ponytail (my parents didnt let it get that long)

we were eventually required to change into gym uniforms in locker rooms at the catholic school my parents put me through and i would try to hide my body as much as possible, change as fast as possible, and stay close to the door so i could leave as soon as i was done. could be awkwardness, but looking back i associate it with insecurity of a masculine body and being forced to be in a masculine environment

i went through a period of trying to be hypermasculine because the people i was friends with at the time were. also had a lot of conflicted thoughts about starting to grow armpit hair, adams apples, and voice drops. i wanted it all to happen so i wouldn't be some kind of outcast, but i somehow didnt realize i felt conflicted because it would make me seem more masculine

when caitlin jenner came out and transitioned and my stupid conservative friends made fun of her, i defended her and didn't see a problem, and kinda looked up to her and i was never sure why. it turns out now that she's a terrible person, but that was my first exposure to what a trans person is.

my sister (3 year age gap, for reference) would make me play games and toys with her when she was younger  because i was the older sibling and i never had any problem or aversion to playing with barbies and dolls. i think at one point she wanted me to dress in one of her princess dress-up sets and i happily obliged

had i been in a different environment growing up im positive i wouldve realized i was trans much earlier...

any of this resonating with anyone?
\-i had no concept of gender until they ingrained it into us during those classes where they talked about how ‚Äùyour body will begin to change when you get older‚Ä¶‚Äù

\-during those classes i suffered because i didn‚Äôt want that to happen to me

\-when i was ten i went around telling everyone that i wanted to be ten forever (because i didn‚Äòt want to have a chest or periods and such)

\-when my chest started to grow i was crying every day and hated seeing it

\-the only time i was happy was in 4th grade when i was playing with a group of boys for the whole year because i didn‚Äôt understand the girls and playing with boys was wayyyy more fun

edit: also i read a lot of books where characters would get their period and i was just like ‚Äúhow do you like this?‚Äù and there was also whole ‚Äúyou‚Äôre officially a woman‚Äù thing and i just felt like there was something wrong with me because i never wanted that to happen

that‚Äôs all i‚Äôve collected from my childhood so far
When I first heard what sex was I tried to imagine it. I kept imagining myself as the guy. ‚ÄúNo, that can‚Äôt be right, I‚Äôm a girl!‚Äù I kept at it until I forced myself to be a girl in my head. Lol
I suddenly started taking lots of selfies when I grew my hair out as a teenager and pretty much every single time I looked vaguely feminine I'd take like a dozen of them. Didn't do this before I grew my hair out except maybe a few every 4 or 5 months. 

Then I grew out my facial hair after having no money for razors for a while and practically stopped taking them entirely. Looking in the mirror became a less pleasant ritual where I'd basically be staring myself down almost aggressively.
omg, i have so many: 
1. seeing Mulan binding and wishing i could look like that
2. crying because people would tell me i was going to be a ‚Äúyoung woman‚Äù soon 
3. hating my body: especially my chest bc i couldn‚Äôt pass as a guy anymore 
4. never shopping in the ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs‚Äù section bc even looking at those clothes made me uncomfortable
Enby here!

-Being very obsessed with Leslie from Bridge to Terabithia, and specifically being jealous of the fact that the protagonist couldn't tell whether she was a girl or a boy when he first meets her

-Always being uncomfortable going to the bathroom. Legitimately wondered (when I was maybe 7?) if the midwife somehow got it wrong when I was born

-In high school, wondering if I might actually be intersex but hadn't shown any signs so no one caught it (I'm really sorry if this is offensive to actual intersex people, I was not educated on that at all at the time)

-When I started menstruating, my sister told me, ""congrats, you're a woman now!"" and I thought, I don't want to be. Chalked it up to ""everyone hates their period""

-Being so uncomfortable with the word ""woman"" that I would avoid using it as much as humanly possible until I was about 18

-Frequently making a joke where I would let a girl go in front of me and say, ""ladies first!"" Vehemently opposed being called a ""lady"" because I wasn't lady-like/proper enough

-When I would play make-believe as a kid, I would play both the role of the princess who gets captured, and the knight in shining armor who saves the princess. I wanted to be both.  

The hard part was being sapphic and thinking that I thought women were beautiful because I wanted to look like them, not because I found them attractive. The age-old, do I want to be this person or be with them?

Edit: formatting
My big one was that I never had a sexual fantasy where I was a man. It took me a very long time to realize that was unusual
What if I hardly fit any of these? (I‚Äôve never been to sleepovers, never been allowed to try on makeup, never been uncomfortable around queer people) then again I‚Äôm still young and stuff but damn that crying in the shower wanting to be a girl‚Ä¶ I feel that. I feel that a lot.
Always hated my deadname. For a while I went by a nickname for it with my friends which was also very fem (if not more than the deadname) but in a certain context COULD be masculine and sounded like a masculine name. However, hearing the full name used by family made me CRINGE. I hated it and couldn‚Äôt pinpoint why. 

One time I bought a mens shirt. I fully intended on wearing it in a fem way, but the fact it was a mens shirt just made me feel really good and I was very excited to wear it. (18 almost 19)

The fact that whenever I had a cover or blanket, I would always cover my chest with it. 

The fact that when I wore a sports bra more often than push-up bras, I felt more confident and decided I‚Äôd never wear a push up bra again. It wasn‚Äôt a physical comfort thing (though underwire sucks) but rather that the sports bra was making me flatter‚Ä¶but I was sad because it wasn‚Äôt flat enough (17)

The fact that the first piece of trans media I consumed was a Dan and Phil fic where Dan was ftm, and after reading it I went to the bathroom, stuck my hair in a beanie, and felt ‚Ä¢something‚Ä¢ but got super scared and decided to repress it (age 12)
- always wanted to play a boy in pretend games as a kid 

- funnily enough, I kept getting cast to play men in plays at my school. It was bc not enough cis boys wanted to be in plays but I was always really happy for the excuse to dress and act like a man. (I always killed it too)

- drawing myself as a boy and even picking a name. I definitely wasn't trans though just my boysona ü§™

- in college we did a project about our ""alter egos"" my alter ego was just me as a boy with a different name. Still wouldn't even consider maybe I was trans ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- wrote secret notes to my best friend in HS about how I wished I had a boys body and thought she would agree she has those thoughts too (she didn't)

- I never felt my name or body were ""me"" it just felt wrong. Getting my period, getting my first bra, felt so WRONG. I just hated all of it. I was jealous of boys at my school going thru puberty getting deeper voices.

- I only liked my boobs because society said I had desirable tiddies lol. I had DD which was like every cishet man's dream so I was like ah yes I love this big horrible annoying sweaty things that I wish I could remove off my chest because...gross men like them üòì I just felt like I couldn't escape that idk

That's abt all I can think of atm there's definitely more.
ftm, realized i was trans (non binary) around late 8th grade, came out as ftm in 10th


‚Ä¢ when i would wash my hair i‚Äôd put it all on the top of my head and say ‚Äúlook i‚Äôm a boy now‚Äù 

‚Ä¢ was always confused as to why the other girls wanted a bigger chest

‚Ä¢ was confused as to why you‚Äôd want to show off your feminine body

‚Ä¢ was confused when people told me to start wearing bras

‚Ä¢ teachers and students would always say ‚Äúoh i thought you would be a boy because of your name‚Äù and i would always get happy or wouldn‚Äôt really mind

‚Ä¢ someone on the bus told me ‚Äúyour arms are hairier than mine and i‚Äôm a guy‚Äù and i just sat there confused for a second cause i forgot i wasn‚Äôt a guy

‚Ä¢ would always volunteer to be the dad when playing house

‚Ä¢ wanted to be friends with people in the way guys were friends with people 

‚Ä¢ confused as to why i wasn‚Äôt going through puberty like my guy friends were 

‚Ä¢ went into the boys bathroom and then when i noticed i didn‚Äôt have the same parts as the boys i got upset and started crying (and this was a group bathroom break at a christian preschool? don‚Äôt know why the teacher let me go in as i was obviously female and a couple years back they closed because they were scared that they would be forced to accommodate transgender children)

‚Ä¢ was always a tomboy, literally didn‚Äôt feel like a girl at all

‚Ä¢ most/all of the feminine/girly things i did i only did because i was a ‚Äògirl‚Äô and that‚Äôs what girls are supposed to do

‚Ä¢ would always sit with my legs apart and when my mom would tell me to sit lady like i‚Äôd be confused cause to me i wasn‚Äôt a lady

‚Ä¢ whatever guys i had a ‚Äòcrush‚Äô on basically looked like what i could‚Äôve looked like if i was born a boy, judging by the fact that i‚Äôm aromantic and asexual it was probably just gender envy

‚Ä¢ was always envious/upset over my friends who were taller, more masculine looking, born male, etc.

‚Ä¢ since my birth name is neutral/masculine leaning when i was younger i tried going by a more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù name, cause obviously the reason i didn‚Äôt feel like a girl is because i didn‚Äôt have a girls name


and i think this is all i can think of??? i don‚Äôt remember my childhood very well at all and thinking back on this stuff has been rough lmao

edit: added more things
A small thing, I just assumed everyone got dick sympathy regardless of whether or not they actually had a penis. It was only after I realized I was a man that I inquired with my cis women friends, and basically none of them had a physical reaction to seeing someone get nailed in the nuts.
(i'm mtf)First probably the fact that i thought that it was normal for boys to hate being boys and always want to be a girl, should've been a sign. And second that when i got to around age 12 i was jealous of all the girl getting boobs and looking good.
I always felt estranged from myself. I remember  I looked in the mirror every night, and barely knew who I was.

I was also very estranged from manhood in general. I never felt like a man, and to be honest the only times I described myself as a man was sarcastic, because I thought wanting to be manly was a joke.

I hated body hair and still do.

Never felt like the other kids, and was always the odd one out.

I always felt at odds with being categorized as a boy. Like ""I never got to choose. If I could I'd choose differently.""

Before my egg fully cracked I just rationalized it by saying that it would be to much work to transition.

I also thought I didn't have dysphoria until I found that disassociating is part of it, and then because my disassociation was blocking most of my emotions I never ruminated on the fact that I didn't feel at home in my own body.
Just some stuff that comes to mind right now:

Having a hard time trying to distinguish between being attracted to a woman and wanting to be her, something I never had an issue with about men.

Wanting to interact with women/girls my age, but always feeling like I couldn't and that I would make them uncomfortable. Anytime a woman was especially nice to me or went out of her way to interact with me, I felt very happy about it.

To that point, I realized I always saw women as being better than men. Not in like an over misandrist way, but just liked having female doctors, liked the way women did things, appreciated their input more then men's, etc. 

Signs of dissociation and derealization that I didn't realize. 

I couldn't easily and fully understand trans men or non binary people, but I had no issue understanding trans women. 

Wanted to wear women's clothes, wear makeup, and do my nails, but never did because I didn't want to do them as a man. Obviously men can do all those things, but doing them as a man didn't feel right to me, so it was just something I thought that would be cool to do if I was a woman. 

Being envious of pretty much every woman I saw.

Feeling a connection to lesbian relationships, even during the time that I considered myself a gay man.

In contrast, I never felt connected to gay/bi men and didn't feel right considering myself one.

There's probably a lot more, but these are just one's that I've become aware of.
I did the gender swap filter thing a lot too, I got confused when I accidentally called myself gay for liking guys, I use to pretend I had a d
‚Ä¢ i used to always play the male characters in game from an early age. i did have female characters too, but i would still dress them up like tomboys.

‚Ä¢ my first crush ever was on a girl who i was very confident i liked ""in a guy way"".

‚Ä¢ i remember once thinking to myself while looking in the mirror that i looked like a boy, but with long hair and girl clothes. i was very young at the time, so that feeling scared me because i wanted to fit in with the girls my age.

‚Ä¢ i drew a masc genderbend of myself for funsies circa freshman year of highschool.

‚Ä¢ i wouldn't come to finally be happy with my appearance or even recognize it as myself until i started cutting my hair short. in fact, the first time i got a pixie cut, i was *euphoric*.

‚Ä¢ i always yearned to look like an anime boy of some sort during the height of my weeaboo phase.

‚Ä¢ oof just remembered how viscerally awful i always felt wearing dresses. i fucking *hated* makeup with a passion, i'd wash it off instantly whenever someone forcibly made me wear it. and on random days where i'm doing nothing, i'll get pangs of raw dysphoria. they'd appeared most when i wore skirts, so i haven't felt that way since i stopped wearing them.

‚Ä¢ i used to try on my dad's clothes a lot. i had a whole phase in middle school where i'd wear his ties and fedoras. i know, it was really cringy but it was all i had!

i literally could go ON. i was so terribly repressed and i struggled a lot with internalized phobias, and i felt this sort of pressure to be the perfect girl‚Ñ¢Ô∏è because of the culture i grew up in. and womanhood was more of a performance than a pleasure for me lol
The big one for me was a dream I had in highschool. My brain literally gave me female body to look at. My entire dream was just me examining myself and eventually crying what I VERY much later realized were happy tears, but at the time all I could think when I woke up was ""am I gay?""
I was convinced my genitals were wrong since I was 4

I regularly got in trouble for refusing to wear shirts

90% of my friends were boys

Multiple situations where one of the girls had to volunteer to be grouped in with boys because of limited space, I immediately volunteered because it just made sense for it to be me.

I had nightmares of growing nipples over every surface of my body starting with puberty

I had good dreams where I was a boy.

I figured out I was trans at 28.
1. At ages 3-7, my friends were exclusively boys (usually autistic boys, too, not sure why--I am not autistic), and I thought I was one of the boys. My mom tried to girly-fy me, but the only girl friend on my street was super butch. I would be SHOCKED today to find out they're straight, let alone still living as a girl.
2. I have always had a huge aversion to my name. I thought everyone went through life feeling awkward and weird about hearing and saying it, especially if they had to introduce themselves several times to several people - like I do with patients. Found out - nope, that's not normal, name dysphoria is a thing.
3. I was flat out jealous when friends came out as I grew up because I felt like they'd figured things out and I was always a mess. When my good guy friend came out gay in high school, I was heartbroken, but not because I thought he didn't like me for being a girl. I felt like I was also a gay boy, so why didn't he like me?
4. Watching West Side Story and relating way the hell more to Anybodys than I ever did any of the female leads - and I looove that musical
5. In school, never wanting to dress out in gym in the open. Always always always in a stall. And I naturally have a ""nice"" feminine body, nice tits, skinny, tall - nope. Super modest. Even my dad tried to encourage me to dress more feminine. My husband noticed all the feminine things in my closet that I never wore and made me get rid of my oversized hoodies so I'd actually wear the girly stuff. I only started wearing dresses more as a phase after my daughter was born and I was sucked into the Lula craze.
6. Slicking my hair back in the mirror at 13 and thinking what a good looking boy I would be.
7. My aunt gave my sister a big, witchy ""womanizing"" ceremony when she had her period. Was a really, really big deal for our Pagan family friends. She called me every month for two years to find out if I'd started mine yet when I turned 12. Helped my cousin get hers next. Aunt started calling again. I started my period on my 14th birthday - never told my aunt, never did the ceremony. Wonder if she still thinks I haven't hit puberty yet lol (I'm 34)
8. Cutting my hair pixie short for the first time and asking for a boy's haircut. They asked me if I really wanted to look like a boy. My response, ""What's wrong with that?"" They feminized it anyway.

The truth is, I can think of many signs. But the biggest was when I started writing gay male characters and said out loud to my husband, ""I don't think I'm trans. I mean, right? I can't be. But if I was, I'd be a gay man. Yeah. I'm way more a gay man than a cis woman.""

And here we are. He's straight and I'm fucked, an adult with two kids. Stuck.
Getting dissapointed when I wouldn't wake up and magically be a girl.. yeah-
Well lets see for me
-fawning and being jealous over asian boys and girls because they could pass as the opposite sex, look young, and andro

-rubbing my chest like boobs were there

-strong resonance with Princess Daisy from the Mario universe

-hand limp at uncertain times

-underlying sadness that i could never pinpoint til i found myself

-secret lipstick and dress shopping 

-my interest in transwomen

-desire to go  doll myself up and go night streetwalking as a girl (please dont do this, i was 19 at that time and i didnt have queer influence)

-THE BIGGEST SIGN - my gramdna literally asking me (12 yo at that time) if i felt like there was someone else inside of me
- When I was around 8 years old I asked my mom if it was possible for me to be a girl, and I was disappointed when she told me no
- When I was 16, after participating in a ""masculine"" activity with my dad, I felt really bad and just said to myself ""Why can't I just be a girl?"" I didn't think anything of it at the time. (I still enjoy the activity now, I just had repressed gender issues)
- Puberty ruined my life for 7 years. My dysphoria got really bad from a physical standpoint and I felt gross constantly. I tried to think of some other reason why this was happening but none of them made any sense. I eventually shared this experience with some of my male friends at the time and they just looked at me confused. That's when I knew.
As a (very) young child I would run around topless and get mad when I would get yelled at because my boy cousin could do it

Always playing the guy during make believe with my friends and LOVING IT like actually feeling more happy/comfortable than in real life 

always singing the boy parts to disney/any songs 

Doing anything and everything in my power to stop my boobs from growing (to the point where  I would wish for breast cancer so I could get them removed (keep in mind I had never heard of top surgery or even trans men at that point)) 

Having a serious conversation with my mom about getting my hair cut short (she thought it was going to be about birthcontrol I was that nervous about asking her) 

Being misogynistic as all hell because I wanted to seperate myself as far away from women as humanly possible and that's what guys were like right?? (This was a hard one to unlearn) 

Mulan was my FAVORITE movie like... I want to do that

I'm sure there were more I just can't think of them at the moment
Insisting and succeeding in getting a female role in a school play, I was around 10 years old. The first dream I remember having was a gender swapping dream. When kids at my school where debating wether girls or boys where the best gender, I always took a neutral position. I used to actively avoid trans space because they made me feel weird and question myself. I have no clue how I never doubted being cis before this year.
The completely cis-male urge to have a vagina instead of a penis. Which oddly enough, i still dont want the surgery and would much rather keep my girl cock lol
If I'm not mistaken these were mine:

-Certain ""girls toys"" that I wanted to play but I wasn't allowed to (the one that comes to my mind is this https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41T6045VF8L._AC_SX425_.jpg); 7 years old.

-Envy of not being able to wear some girls clothing like skirts or full side swimsuit; 10 years old.

-Internal debates or questions in my head about why I wasn't born as a girl (which I dismissed because I thought it was due to hormones); 12 years old to right now with 21.

-Envy of my female friends body in general and hated to be expected to have muscles and he thought; 13 to 16 years old (here is where I started to consider that maybe I was trans although I didn't do anything or told anyone until I had 18 years old and I couldn't handle it).

And I think that's it, since I started transitioning I still have bad thoughts about being born in the wrong body, having envy of practically every single cis female person that I saw on the street and killing myself but I'm definitely 50 times better now that I started to be myself (which is also another red flag)
‚Ä¢ Tried to stand to pee as a young child (repeatedly)


‚Ä¢ refused to wear a shirt at home until I was 6 or 7


‚Ä¢Called my self a tomboy in elementary school, even though I presented femme. Turns out I was just a boy.


‚Ä¢when I learned about handshakes I would make a  conscious effort to keep my hand firm because that's more ""manly"".


‚Ä¢ one time my mom tried to take me to a specialist to see if my chest was developing normally. They never got to examine me because I was so upset. I crushed a soda can in my fist because I was so stressed.


‚Ä¢once I hit puberty, I refused to wear a bra, I didn't even have any to wear during gym class freshman year. Someone had to tell me they could see my nipples through my shirt and I had to borrow a bra from one of the girls. 


‚Ä¢ After I started puberty, any time I had to have my chest or crotch examined by  doctors, (who were women) I would freak out. The only way to even remotely get me to allow it was bribery.


‚Ä¢Read BL and wanted to be with the main character, but not in a straight way. Liked girls but not in a gay way.
I never had much signs, but the big three that come to mind are 1) always keeping my hair long, 2) hated taking my shirt off and 3) never felt embarrassed wearing makeup in public. I didn't wear makeup in public frequently, but when I did, I was a pretty big Marilyn Manson fan, so I already had an excuse lined up for 1 and 3. Now that I think of it, I used to always want to look like Marilyn Manson before I went trans, so I guess that's sorta-kinda-maybe a red flag (?).
>! I used to wish I had a fertility disorder so I could never become pregnant. !<
(FTM) got called ‚Äúsir‚Äù every once in a while in restaurants and kept thinking about it for WEEKS every time it happened
I love this, because I grew up in a relatively accepting environment but still had ZERO idea I was trans until I entered my twenties lol.

* I was a theater kid who was in hindsight a little too comfortable playing male roles (I‚Äôm FtM). I always thought it was just because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an actor, gender doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù which is true to an extent but looking back there was def gender euphoria there.

* When I was little and playing pretend games, same thing ‚Äî didn‚Äôt mind being a boy ‚Äúcharacter,‚Äù secretly got gender euphoria from it.

* I would watch movies like Mulan and She‚Äôs The Man and secretly not understand why / be disappointed that the main character ‚Äúdecided to be a girl again.‚Äù

* Genuinely did not understand that some people actually enjoyed being female.

* Always kind of wanted to change my name, for reasons I didn‚Äôt understand. I didn‚Äôt even dislike my (now dead) name, just kind of felt it wasn‚Äôt mine.

* Mostly stopped wanting to wear skirts and dresses around the age of puberty except on special occasions‚Ä¶ it just stopped feeling like me.

* Upon realizing I was queer in high school and not knowing what my label was, repeatedly telling myself ‚Äúat least I know I‚Äôm not transgender.‚Äù

* Fascination with ‚Äúgender bending‚Äù or anything that broke gender norms.

* Hating to cut my hair (I realized much later it was partly because my long hair was the one ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù thing about myself that I actually liked. I do not have long hair anymore and haven‚Äôt since I transitioned as I don‚Äôt feel yet like I can ‚Äúpass‚Äù without short hair, but I do sometimes miss it).

‚Ä¶there are more, but those are some of the most interesting ones to me personally at the moment.
-can remember at least two childhood dreams about being able to swap genitals. 

-""invented"" (I was 5) a remote that could swap genitals. 

-was sure being born a girl but being magically swapped. 

-I wanted a doll house but I don't know if it was for the girly toy or the amount of details, I have add and I always loved complex toy.

-a bit latter around 12, I always daydreamed about being able to morph into some sort of monster, that transformed into wishing I was able to morph into a woman. Though it would go alway lol.

-""girls are so beautiful, why anybody would want be a man? That's unfair!"" 

-around 14, secretly trying women's clothes and apparition of the gender bender adult content crave. 

-at 16 not letting mom cut my hair anymore, couldn't be coerced into that either. 

-generally being weird af and uncomfortable at meeting new people
Thinking I'd be the perfect girl (I am)
Do femme things and dress femme ""as a gag""
Complain that I got ripped off when I would compare myself to my female relatives
Having a lot of close female friends made me feel like ""an honorary girl""
Curiosity of moms makeup and perfumes and other lady items
Felt more comfortable with girls socially, had guy friends but they weren't typical dude bros
Asking my high school sweetheart ""would you still love me if I were a woman?"" more than a couple times (And yes she does, 14 years later were best friends) 
Aggressively feminist (how can the other boys just not relate to the girls?)
Being mocked for being feminine actually felt more like compliments
That hair thing is a mood. I thought my hair was bad cuz my mom told me to cut it before it got long enough to satisfy me
I feel very weird about calling them ""red flags"" if I'm gonna be honest. I think of them as positive things that I wish I had paid attention to, my brain trying to tell me who I really was. In general ""red flags"" are things that if you see them you run hard in the opposite direction bc they lead to bad things, whereas these were things that I should've run towards and embraced bc it's a positive thing to realise I'm trans. That's my own personal preference I guess. Is it common to call them ""red flags""? I'm gonna call them gender signals.  


My gender signals:  
\- stopped looking in a mirror ever again at age 9 when I hit puberty. Haven't looked in a mirror for over two decades

\- literally only looked in a mirror to hold my long hair back and make it ""short"" and wonder what it would've been like if my twin and I had both been born male and were boy twins

\- dancing scottish dance, I would get very upset if asked to dance on the ""ladies side"" and danced on the ""man's side"" 90% of the time. I also refused to learn the women's steps and also learned how to do physically demanding figures that ppl assumed only very buff men could do (lift partners into the air, highcuts, etc,). I'd do them at age 12 with men almost twice my height who were literal blacksmiths and had arms like tree trunks lol. I was extremely stubborn about it despite having tiny arms like sticks.

\- I'm asexual and incapable of finding ppl attractive without knowing them well, but my only immediate sudden crushes were on trans men (now I realise that it was gender envy and not a crush). Also on gay male characters (whom I definitely wanted to be)

\- at every party I went to, I'd somehow find trans ppl if they were there and spend the entire evening talking only to them. It was like a magnet and other ppl noticed

\- as soon as my breasts (I'm fine with calling them that bc they have nothing to do with me or my gender) grew in I called them ""moles"" and had an image that they had burrowed up and taken residence in my body. I would literally call them moles as I was manhandling them into my bras and always treated them like they were strange creatures who were not a part of me

\- I didn't wear bras until college despite the fact that my boobs are huge and it hurt like hell to not wear a bra. But I didn't want to handle my boobs.

\- for years after I got my period, I refused to shower when I had my period. I'd just wash my hair over the bathtub and lie to my parents that I had fully showered. I would just change pads and refuse to look at that area or touch it or clean it or anything. Also refused to use tampons for over a decade bc it involved touching that area way too much.

\- I became fully obsessed with songs specifically by either trans men or by tenor-range male vocalists and would listen to the same song on loop and imagine being that person singing

\- when I was 6 years old, I told my parents ""I want to play cello because it has a deep voice and people will listen to me."" I have always liked the low range of the cello and feeling it vibrate in my chest when I play.
I asked my girlfriend if I could wear her thigh highs and she put up my hair and I was the happiest I had been in a long while.

I loved the movie aquamarine because I wanted to be on of the main cast.

I got mad when people told me to get my hair cut
My first dnd character was a girl, and I got lipstick for the part
The most stand-out one to me is once in science class people were screaming at me multiple variations of ‚Äòflat-chested bitch‚Äô I told my friends later with a big grin and they asked if I was ok, genuinely didn‚Äôt realise that it was meant as an insult
I would dress up as a girl/ sleep in a dress when I was younger

I let my female friends dress me up as a girl

Trying to go by she/her
Hating looking in the mirror and seeing pictures of myself

Having a very specfic kind of high heels I like my wife to wear 

Feeling like I don't fit in in a male social context but not being able to pinpoint why

Hair loss being extremely upsetting for reasons I couldn't pinpoint at the time

Having always wanted long hair

Always feeling like I am different in some way, even in school

Not feeling like/caring about being ""manly""

Hating clothes shopping and not really caring about physical presentation at all. I still have some t-shirts I've had since I was 14 (now 30)

When I still identified as a crossdresser last year, I felt funny (like a sort of sadness) whenever I took off my feminine clothes (I still do btw).
I'm not trans but always felt some type of way about a lot of this stuff. It seems like half of it is just gender roles, and doesn't have to do with physical gender to me. 

I mean, I'm male, but most of the talking points here are things I understand and are ok. It's ok to enjoy makeup, long hair, all that stuff. 

All of these points: 

>Wearing makeup for the first time during the high school musical and absolutely NOT wanting to take off the stage makeup / eyeliner, ever. I looked so good! I took selfies and hid them in a folder on my iPod touch. And yes I know this one is a double-whammy lol. 17 years old. Very cis.
>LOVED long hair. Literally cried when my parents made me get haircuts. Grew it out the second I turned 18.
>College years - close friend group & study group is 80% female. I feel massively uncomfortable around typical cis guys. Always felt like I had to put on a show to fit in with them. Always assumed they knew I was different. Always assumed it was normal to feel out of place among friends. Right? RIGHT?!
>Gender-swap snapchat selfie filters made me feel funny. I couldn't stop staring. Still didn't think anything of it though. 24 years old.

None of that really requires a change in physical identity, it just means being okay with non-traditional views of gender identity. 

I'm not really trying to argue here, it's just something I've wondered about for a while. It feels to me like a lot of what people define as trans is really just a rejection of gender norms, which is ok, but why go through a whole identity change and even surgery just to be okay with something that was already allowed?
- If i ever put on feminine clothes I would take them off and swap them for my comfy clothes in under ten seconds
- always hated bras, would only wear sports bras then senior year ditched bras altogether and called myself a feminist (having clothes around them just reminds me they are there lol) 
- one time my mom saw someone who she felt was giving butch lesbian vibes and she said ‚Äúhow can lesbians hide their tits like that? like the way they stand just erases all signs of their chest‚Äù and that shit stuck with me for some reason? i started standing like that person my mom saw emulating it 
- my family obsessed over my long red curly hair my whole life so i never cut it, but I remember all 3 times I out my hair up and hid it inside of a hat and felt so euphoric and couldnt figure out why

- multiple family members would take me on ‚Äúmakeover trips‚Äù to try and dress me like a real girl, give me girl clothing and make me pretty bc i dressed in only hoodies old t shirts and jeans, never lasted. 
- I was obsessed with men but never attracted to them. every boyfriend i would treat more like a bro and talk to them like a bro- i would even talk about women (like a lil misogynist to get the boys to like me- i gag now )
Ahaha

* Loving Snow White as a kid, but not liking the parts with Snow White in them and just wanting to be Dopey
* Catching bugs and chasing teenage girls with them so I could ""be a boy"" (dumb logic, ik. I was about 6 lol)
* Wearing a skirt to formal events 'cause I had to, but being super disruptive so people would know I hated fancy skirts.
* Throwing a legit tantrum as a 10 year old when I was given a ""girl"" razor, and then finally using it *years* later, after all my female peers had been shaving for years, just because I felt stupid for not doing what everyone else was, but then hiding my legs so no one would know.
* Cutting my eyelashes
* Being terrified of bras, but finally asking for one bc I thought it would make my chest smaller.
* Hiding my period for over a year bc I didn't want to be a girl, and having a panic attack when my sister found out.
* Wanting to wear clothes to impress the guys, but *not* in a sexy way at all. Just so they'd think me super masculine (in my puny girl body lol)
* Getting heart eyes when my crush told his mom I ""don't like being treated like a girl.""
* Thinking I never wanted kids, but later realizing I just wanted to be a dad.

But at the same time I did all these things, I was also really transphobic. Even once I accepted I wasn't a girl, I called myself genderfluid for a while bc I was too scared to admit I was a guy.

* Being happy whenever my mom asked me if I was a guy, and being sad when she stopped because it made my dad mad.

* Refusing to wear a bra for as long as I could and throwing a tantrum when I was forced to wear one in the end.

* Getting mad at the thought of being forced to be a girl.

* Rejecting anything I associated with girls and expressing hate for ‚Äúgirly things‚Äù (even if I didn‚Äôt hate everything).

* Being happy that me and my brother‚Äôs voice used to be similar to the point where our parents didn‚Äôt know who was talking at times (ofc that changed after puberty). 

* Thinking guys were ‚Äúlucky to be born as guys‚Äù.

* Thinking it ‚Äúwould‚Äôve been nice to be a guy‚Äù back when my dad was giving me private driving lessons and we spent a lot of time together.

* Wishing I could dress and look like a guy and thinking that wearing masculine clothes as a girl ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be the same‚Äù.

* Being afraid of buying a shirt I liked because it looked like it was for men, and wondering ‚Äúif it was really ok‚Äù, but then obsessing over it when my parents didn‚Äôt say anything.

* Not being able to enjoy wearing my old shirts after buying an oversized t-shirt that looked like it was for men. Wearing it for as long as I can and being sad when I have to change out of it.

* Hating my body during puberty because it felt wrong and made me feel gross. I planned on getting top surgery when I grew up (for totally cis reasons), and wished I would get ovarian cancer so I could get rid of my womb (I don‚Äôt anymore ofc).

* Wanting to get rid of the estrogen in my body during puberty because I hated feeling like a girl. Wishing I could block the hormone production in my body.

* Always tying my hair back and wearing hoodies. Refusing to wear feminine clothes or leaving the house with untied hair.

* Refusing to wear makeup.

* Intentionally hunching my back so my chest would look flatter (I still do that-). 

* Occasionally joking about ‚Äúforgetting I‚Äôm a girl sometimes‚Äù.

* Joking about how I‚Äôd have to ‚Äúsue someone if my chest was any less flat than it already is‚Äù. 

* Having internalized transphobia specifically towards transmascs, even if I was completely fine with the rest of the lgbtq+ community.

* Thinking ‚ÄúI would never wish to be a guy‚Äù whenever I saw someone say they wished they were one, because deep down I knew that was what I wanted.

* Feeling intense jealousy when my childhood friend came out as a trans guy, even though I tried to be supportive. That‚Äôs when I started to question myself, and reflected on my feelings because they felt irrational and dumb.

* Smiling uncontrollably whenever I saw myself looking like a guy in the mirror. 

* Feeling disconnected from my reflection in the mirror as a kid, and being surprised whenever I saw it. 

* Being confused when a guy told his kid to ‚Äúsit right next to that girl over there‚Äù and I saw her sit next to me. Also being confused over how it confused me-

* Hating the thought of showing interest in guys or being in a relationship with one because that‚Äôs what girls typically do, and it felt like I‚Äôd be ‚Äúforced into the role of a girl‚Äù.

* Being happy when my parents accidentally referred to me as a guy a feeling odd when anyone referred to me as a girl.

* Wishing I could change my voice to sound like a guy. 

That‚Äôs all I can remember‚Ä¶

Heyooo, fellow religious-trauma haver. What's up.
Pretty much the exact same for being excluded
Daydreaming about the exact wording of the three wishes I would eventually get from a Genie to make sure that I got the \*exact\* body I wanted.
Gah! That's wild. I really relate to that first moment of seeing the real you in the mirror. That hit hard. I remember that. I think I cried the first time I did makeup at home alone. And I was like, REALLY bad at it lol. But it didn't matter.
What's up with the hair stylist not going shorter? Did they insist on a ""minimum hair length for girls"" or something?
Yeah, I also rushed straight for weight loss when I started to crack. I knew I wanted to be a girl and I wanted to be hot, dammit lol. (or at least my version of it - I know not everybody has to be a twig to be pretty).
Yeah, I sorta get that. I liked my beard growing up because it was something I was expected to have, and it made me feel like I fit in (even if I didn't like the facial hair itself).
Go for it! :)
Yupppp, big same. My friendships with girls were always so much better. Like, our humor was closer, the things we wanted to talk about were more similar. Everything just felt more natural with girls.
This really resonated with me.  


Thank you for sharing it.
Oh god I thought I looked like Harry Potter as a child then imagined was Anakin Skywalker but in another universe. When I grew out of that I imagined having the body of some male anime character all the time. Also for some reason as a teen wanted to transition once I hit 18 to look like a guy I had a crush on. Now I‚Äôm an adult and unpacking everything lol
It's insane what we learn to repress. Or rather, are forced to repress.
Interesting. Around puberty I stopped swimming without a shirt on. I'm in my 40s now so it's.. Been awhile. I stopped swim team around 13.

I simply stopped being comfortable bare chested. Period. Even at home alone. It feels like.. Being fully naked.

Bare chested in public? God no. I fucking hate doctors visits that require taking my shirt off.
The male protagonist one! That one there! I remember staring in front of the bathroom mirror shirtless imaging that I was casted to play ""young loki"" and in this world I had to wear this weird flesh suit thing to hide my chest. I would also after a shower grab onto the top of the sliding shower door and kinda ""flex"" and ""pose"" as if I were a model and had muscles or something.
I didn't have a button, per-se. I instead curled up into a ball in the shower and closed my eyes reeeaaally tight and told myself that if I *believed* hard enough, I'd be a girl when I opened my eyes. It of course never worked and I'd just get sad.

I was 10, don't make fun of me.
That last sentence is frightening. What did that entail?
THIS. Some strange combination of internalized misogyny and transphobia. I cringe whenever I look back on it lol
god bless those friends am i right lol
Ah yes, and when I first got my period I had first no Issue with it because I was allowed to stay home, but hafter the fith day I was so frustrated that I started crying
stealing your brother's clothes lmao

such a mood.

i wish i had a brother
ah, next life...

my mom bullied me that i'd keep reincarnating male if i didn't just accept being male in this life and stop talking about feeling like i was trapped in wrong body... :(

i resolved to die in the cold war (volunteer for military when i was old enough... late 1980s) just so i could get to reincarnate female faster.  i felt that dying in war would \*have\* to fulfill any male Karma that i had to deal with, right? :P >.<
I remember one time my mom gave me a haircut with one of those god-forsaken vacuum cleaner / hair cutter hybrid monstrosities and I literally cried for hours afterwards. I looked utterly ridiculous, and my friends gave me shit for weeks over it.

My dad told me to apologize to my mom for hurting her feelings after the crying. Even though I pleaded with them for days not to cut my hair, especially not with that thing.

Google ""flowbee"". You can't make this shit up.
What they meant to say is ""we've been trying really hard to ignore all the signs and you're making that really hard right now"".
i‚Äôm the same way with she/her pronouns, like my brain just doesn‚Äôt compute the fact that *i‚Äôm* the she/her being talked about

on the bright side it makes it more difficult to be hurt when someone misgenders you (at least in my case)
Yep. Went such a long time before I even knew trans people were a thing. And even after I found out my parents told me they were evil soooo that obvs wasn't an option.
ikr? giving female vibes to people... i mean, i was pretty open about myself and would say when people asked me about being different... that i felt like a woman, or had a woman's heart... 'basically female"" and stuff like that...

but gosh... online people just assumed i was female without me doing anything to promote the idea at all...

in military, i realize looking back that a lot of the straight guys who were friends with me who kinda took care of me and helped me with things... they... were basically treating me as female, and in some cases almost like a girlfriend.

still remember the one guy... we were both ending a temp work contract in europe... he owned a yacht and invited me to spend with him a six month cruise.  now, this guy was totally straight.  i was married.  and gosh... 6 months on a yacht? wow.  today (3 years into transition)... sure, i'd go.  then?  no. no way.  i mean, he didn't even understand what was spinning in his unconscious mind, right?

i've talked to other trans girls and some of them also have stories of confused straight guys seeming to have weird feelings about them pre-transition...
Congrats on the self discovery! Feels like just yesterday I was more or less where you're at now. Good luck with everything, and don't hesitate to chat if you ever need help!
Aaaaaa! I did the prayer thing too. God my religious parents sucked.
Yeah, same. It's funny how I sort of ""knew"" as a young kid. 10ish. And then I buried it and it didn't really bubble up to the surface again for like 15 years after that.
Coming out is hard. So far only my wife and a few friends know. Zero of my coworkers know yet.
Wow that's amazingly early on! Crazy how things like that stick with you for so long.
Me tooo
I had this with wayyy to many male characters and irl guys lol
Yeah, I've found that my list only grows the more I think about it lol.
It's easy to talk yourself in circles with this stuff because, as you pointed out, all of these things are related to societal norms. As you've probably heard repeated 1000 times, gender is a social construct. It's true though.

If it weren't, none of the things I listed would be typically associated with humans assigned female at birth. BUT THEY ARE. So yeah. You can insist that all of this stuff is ""just okay to do anyway as an assigned male at birth person"", and while you're not wrong, the argument is also kind of pointless. Yeah, I could insist I'm male, but if I wear dresses, makeup, have long hair, take hormones and grow boobs, and train my voice to sound feminine....would anyone really care that I identify as male? NOPE. Nothing about me is outwardly male, so at the end of the day, it's just a label.

Which brings up a good point: ALL genders are just a label. 

But they serve a purpose. Those labels (like pronouns) serve to provide information to others, for better or worse. We all assume things about a person the minute we find out if they go by ""he"" or ""she"". Because society associates so many things with those labels. It's how the world currently works. You can choose to like it or not, agree with it or not, but pretending it isn't the case is futile. 

So, I identify as female. Because that fits me MUCH more than ""male"" does, based on 1) how I feel about myself, and 2) the things society associates with ""female"". 

Surgery is desired by lots of trans people, myself included, because it makes their bodies feel more correct. I have things I don't like about my body that I intend to change, although I didn't list them above. Read these responses in this thread. How many trans men do you see discussing how awful it felt to grow breasts? So many! Body dysphoria is real. Getting surgery isn't a ""well I guess I'll do this because I said I was trans"" thing. It's something you do so you can feel okay in your body.

Finally - you asked ""why change your whole identity when you could just do what you want?"". Please understand that it's not about changing my (our) identities as trans people. Our identities have always been what we are inside. It isn't our fault that the world labeled us incorrectly at birth, or that our bodies don't feel right. I am not changing my identity. I'm letting the world know that it got it wrong.

I had a lot of hair. Like. Mid back at least if I remember because I had been in cheerleading for a long time and the high ponytails are a whole thing in cheer. And because my mom was super controlling of my hair. Mother Gothel about it. She cried when I cut it and to this day occasionally complains that i never grow it out.. But anyways. The stylist was sure that I was going to regret cutting so much hair at once and wanted to give me a ""head start"" on growing it back üôÉ 

When I told the next hairstylist about the incident she was like, ""I let people make their own choices in my chair but a lot of girls end up really missing their long hair that they spent years growing out.""

Which funny enough the fact that I never once missed my hair could be another flag. (Mixed with rebellion from control)
The real kicker is ‚Äúdo I actually go by these pronouns or was it just expected of me to go by them so I got used to them‚Äù
around 6-7 was when I learned that all my wants, desires, my movement, basically my entire self was wrong and I was not permitted to choose my own clothes and stuff like that after so what else you gonna do,

repress, depersonalise, and live in a meaningless dream of life
How did you get your name as a user flair? (I love your name btw)
your comment just made me realize why I hated swim team when I was younger. I couldn‚Äôt stand being shirtless.
I want to be shirtlesss it feels nice when u don‚Äôt have the female things
... I was in my 30s.

(eta: Yes, I really did this too. Albeit not in the shower, just in my bedroom with all the lights out, desperately manifesting that when I [turned the lights back on/woke up in the morning] that I'd have changed.)
Haha it‚Äôs not supposed to be. I mean I wanted them to show me how they lived like what they do, how they walk, how they sit down, simple stuff like that.
It was so bad LOL. I really was on that ''ugh, girls are so annoying'' bandwagon and hung out with guys more. The irony that I turned out to be a lesbian.
Oof‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that
They've come around by now, but it *was* quite the hurdle.
same, especially now that i know why it bothers me
Yeah I‚Äôm realizing that I‚Äôve always acted more feminine and had supportive parents but my knowledge of self and who I am was forced into the closet by bullies.
I am so sorry, that‚Äôs a hard thing to go thru, especially when it doesn‚Äôt work üòñ

I hope you‚Äôve found better ways to be yourself since! üíñ
That's ok and great for you. I'm sorry that it isn't something I understand. Thank you for clarifying it.

I still don't entirely understand it. But I do not mean in any way to suggest that that means it isn't valid.

I just believe that you can be male in gender and also be okay with wearing a dress.

It's just something I'm confused about people going through surgery for, but that doesn't make that decision any less valid. It's just something I wanted to understand better. I think I do now. I am sorry if anything I said suggested otherwise.

I guess what I am trying to ask is: why worry so much about what other people label you as? Guy, girl, whatever, it isn't up to them, it's up to you. You can be whatever type of person you want to be. I guess I feel like putting that label on other people is some sort of giving up? Like if you are going to be responsible for what other people label you as, you are basically accepting that label. 

Again, I don't have any problem with whoever you want to be. It just is something I am confused about.
Yes, a club where we cope with religious upbringing
I‚Äôll join
I relate so hard to this - when you have long pretty hair, hairstylists will beg not to cut it. No joke. I've done big big big chops many times and always get the same reaction even when I insist my long hair isn't who I am, it just hides who I am. (But I'm currently growing mine again to try for the hot long hair guy look to add to my masc style lol)
Ugh :( I'm so sorry. I feel that though. My folks taught me that lgbtq people were all going to hell. So I sat in the shower at 10 years old and cried because I wanted to be a different gender and I was pretty sure that meant I was going to hell. I knew for sure it meant I couldn't talk to my parents about it.

Represssssiiionnn
I believe there's an option for a custom flair in the flair options! Just type whatever ya want! Haha.

And thank you :) I am also really happy with it. It feels like me!
I didn't really seem to care until puberty.
Nooo, no apologies are necessary. All good questions! And yeah, re: ""why care how others label you?"". It's hard. I don't want to care. I try really hard not to, and there's a lot of days where I'm just thrilled to know myself better than I used to, and to be making changes in my life that make me happier. But at the same time it's hard for me because, personally, I'm still closeted to work and extended family. My wife and friends are the only ones that know. It's hard knowing that my work friends and parents literally might not speak to me anymore if I told them - they're all quite conservative, hence why I'm still closeted. There's a good chance that many of them would insist on calling me a man just to hurt me. And it would hurt. I can't pretend that it wouldn't.

Sooo, it's complicated. I am 100% happier after realizing that I'm a woman. I don't need the approval of others for that. But I do need their approval in the sense that they are my close friends and family, and I love them, and it would just really hurt if they stopped feeling the same way about me.

As for total strangers? It's mostly a safety thing. I don't wanna get murdered for being obviously transgender. If a stranger sees me as a trans woman and is nice about it, that's plenty good enough for me. But if I ""pass"" well enough that the entire world sees me as female, there's safety in that. People don't kill cis women for being cis women. Trans women though? Short of murder, there's still employment discrimination, hate speech, etc...all unfun things.
Id love one of those lmao
I'm real now and the past never really existed to me so things are going well

We have to be visible. We are not ashamed of who we are.	"For transgender day of visibility we want to recognize how far our community has come as a whole. We live in a society where our rights are attacked for not being understood. Where our family and friends reject us for who we are. Where we must do what we can to fit in, in a society that would exile and attack us for being who we are.

We want to remind everyone that we are stronger and more plentiful when unified than those who would oppress us and tear us down. Our rights **are** human rights, lest we forget that access to healthcare, the right to self identity, and the right to exist as you are, are rights that everyone should have access to. We are  just as diverse, just as fallible, just as **human**, as any other group of people that exist.

There are those who would fearmonger, who would tell us to hide who we are from fascism, they are the same people who would tear us down in the first place. We must stand strong as a group, hold true to ourselves, and live our lives as who we are. Though we must keep in mind that there are those of us that are in places where they can‚Äôt be themselves, where their life would be in danger just to express who they are, we must be strong for them.

There has been a rapid rise in hate recently, as people spew nonsensical rhetoric to tear down trans people. That can be scary to see, especially if you live in places that are actively passing laws to attack our lives. We must make our voices heard, our unrest, our fear, our anger, we cannot go down silently.

To those of you who come to our subreddit seeking refuge, seeking a place to be yourself, you have found it. To those of you who are here to bring others down, to gatekeep, to tell others how they should feel, we ask that you leave now as you do not belong here.

# From our team members

## bleeding-paryl

Personally, as someone who has been in this community for a bit over 10 years now, I think I can honestly say that this is both the scariest time to live in parts of the world for trans folk, but also the best time in recent memory to actively be yourself. I‚Äôve seen so much positivity in this community, and I‚Äôm always inspired by the things I see here. We will celebrate who we are, we will live as who we are, and despite things like the recent shooting, we will continue to love ourselves.

I‚Äôve noticed a rather recent and rapid uptick in people coming here who are not trans. For those that come as allies, and are here to support us, thank you. For those who are here expecting us to apologize for a murderer, or who think we‚Äôre not upset ‚Äúenough‚Äù at the murder of children, I would like you to first look inward, and ask yourself why you‚Äôre more upset at us than you are about the people murdered. We are grieving, we are hurt, we are afraid. We can feel multiple things at the same time, and we can acknowledge when things will shine an incorrect light on a community of people just as diverse as the cisgender community.

For those of you who see that kind of hate making its way through, first of all I would like to apologize, as I know we‚Äôre imperfect. I would also like to personally thank you for remaining vigilant and reporting it as you see it. Keep in mind, we‚Äôre _very_ busy, we have regular lives on top of the stuff we do for this community, and we may not see something right away, so I am always appreciative of those who can help.

## TallGeminiGirl

Firstly I would like to thank all of you for your help in reporting bad actors and doing your part to keep r/trans a safe space for all things transgender. We really can not do it with out you all. We, as a mod team, are just a small part of the incredibly diverse and wonderful trans community we represent. You, the users, are the real body, soul, and voice of our community. Thank you for being the wonderful people you are. 

I want to take a moment and share some personal thoughts on recent events. We can not let this stop us. We can not let this push us down and go back into hiding. Those of us who can do so safely need to continue making our voices heard and push back against this wave of hate. This is not a call for violence and I will never, ever advocate for such or defend such actions. Today is our chance to reclaim the current narrative around us. Be visible, be kind, and show the world who we really are and what we stand for. The small actions of a million individuals can easily over power the heinous actions of a single, evil, individual.

And don't be afraid to ask for support and comforting. Talk to your trans friends. Be real with your cis allies. It's high time they really get to know what we are going through and what we are up against. Don't feel like you have to answer for the entire community either. Your own personal needs and mental health is just as if not more important than the needs of our community. 

Stay strong everyone. The seas ahead will be harsh and choppy, but together we can brave the storm and come out stronger on the other side.

## The_Decoy

I am very thankful to have found so much support in these spaces. As someone who came to understand this side of myself much later in life, I find so much inspiration seeing how the community comes together to reinforce each other. These are obviously difficult times with our community being set upon by some incredibly vitriolic bad actors. But we are working our hardest to keep this space clear so the community can continue supporting one another. I am proud to work alongside such a wonderful and dedicated mod team. I am delighted to see how the community places such an emphasis on being respectful and inclusive to each other. Ultimately though we are pursuing our ability to live our best lives. This struggle will not be easy but will be incredibly satisfying once we have attained such an environment. I look forward to pushing for progress alongside such incredible people.

(tw: transphobia) i tried to go into the woman's restroom in the local mall and a woman didn't let me enter	"Im a trans woman, i was in the mall with some friends looking as fem as I can, i makeup was all fucked up because I had cried already that day, on my way to the restroom a woman stood in front of the entrance staring at me with a hateful looking stare and when I tried to walk around her she stepped in front of me.

Now, i know i should have said something and defended myself but I was already feeling frail and also my voice does not pass and I thought it would make things worse, so i didn't say a word, she also didn't say a word, we just stared at each other, but since I really needed to go i put my head down and went into the men's restroom. Did my thing really quickly and went out really quickly, but the experience ruined my entire day, i went home devastated and kinda shaken shortly after.

When I told a friend (trans man) he got really fucking mad and wanted to go in there and make a fuss, but I think that would only make things worse and asked him not to do it.

I guess I'm just emotionally shaken, this has never happened to me and I feel it was very close to becoming a messy situation I would only get out worse.

Edit: Guys thank you very much for the support, it means a lot. To the people that told me to make a fuss or misgender her, i don't think that helps anyone, only hurt our cause.  I know i should have defended myself and just gone in buy I just couldn't at that moment, i was emotionally frail, but I will try to do better next time something like this happens. Thank you for all the love üíúü•∞"	"See that's were i would have pushed past or if not possible but I'm also stubborn and set in my ways
I am so sorry that happened to you.
I guess some just like to pee on their territory and loudly hiss at anyone that comes within striking distance. It's irrational and those of us who see it for what it is can only pity how narrow their mind must be.
I'm sorry üòî She was wrong
It's a REST room, we should be allowed to relax
Why is she guarding a mall restroom or assuming she knows your gender
Let the ignorance of others be the fuel to your fire, or brush it off and say, ""thankfully I'm not like that"" and just keep being your beautiful self.
Thank you for sharing your experience
Nothing a body slam can‚Äôt fix. 

I‚Äôm half kidding, but people like that are fucking terrible.
I would said dude. The mens rest room is over there. When she says ""Im not a man!"" Tell hey ""Oh? Your sure acting like one"" then dab on her like the hater she is.
This is literally my fear going to public restrooms that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt socially transitioned into female restrooms.
I don‚Äôt wanna be bullied or harrased by transphobic women (even if I don‚Äôt pass at all) but I also fear that male will hate crime me for looking hella femme in the guys‚Äô restroom. It‚Äôs a fucked up situation and they don‚Äôt understand the position they‚Äôre putting us when denying us entry.
I‚Äôm so sorry it happened to you!
You know what, no one cares if your voice dosn't pass, tell her to move, it's not your fault u need to use the bathroom, people nowa days, if you still feel emotional about it, you can DM me about it and I can try to make you feel better üíóüíñüíù
Okay so you should contact the mall and tell them that another woman forced you, who are also a woman, to use the men's bathroom and put you in danger. It's not okay and it's illegal for a random person who doesn't own the property to force you to use a bathroom you don't belong in.

They probably have cameras and if you can give them the day, the time, and the part of the mall where it happened then they can probably identify the woman, ban the woman from the property, and help you seek police charges and/or legal action against the woman if you decide to do so.

Like she literally broke the law and put your well being in harms way. The only person who can tell you that you can't use the bathroom is the person who owns the building due to it technically being private property. If it were public property, such as if your city actually owns the building, then no one at all would be allowed to tell you you can't use the bathroom, not the police, the mayor, city council, no one, as your rights to literal public, as in owned by the government, restroom facilities are technically federally protected.
I would take a video of her and report her to the police. If police doing nothing, I would put it on social media. I have zero tolerance with discrimination but I totally understand that you can't fight each time. Having a funny thought right now: if I could piss standing, I would mimic the gesture and say to her : ""Would you prefer a piss on you? Your choice."" Just reading this makes me so angry. Sending love and support to you sister.
I would have confronted that woman.

Ally of transgender people here who isn't trans herself. I had a similar experience once, but not because I ever went trans, but all because my hair was cut short back in kindergarten. My mom had me dress up all girly, and this faculty member of the elementary school did not want me going to the girls' restroom that time.

I wasn't even transferring from girl to boy. All because of a pixie cut that made me look like a boy, I was discriminated. But I remained a girl even with the cut.

I have transgender friends at the university I go to. One of them went from girl to demiboy.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I have no idea why people have it in their minds that gender differences are shown by the length of one's hair.
sheesh That is really shitty. I'm so sorry that's happened to you. No one deserves to be treated that way. I hope that your really lousy day recovers soon, girl.
I'm sorry you experienced this. I'm glad your friend wanted to do something about it, I understand not wanting to make a big deal out of it and just having to pee. It awful and I'm truly sorry.
it sucks but you're not guilty in anyway you were involved in trouble and it fell on you there's just people that need to piss off others to feel good and they should grow up later
this fear (also cause I'm only out like a year and don't pass at all) is why I don't use women's bathroom
Let him throw hands for you. You would do the same for him, right?
Using the restroom is so scary for a lot of us ... And it's fucked up that it is that way... It shouldn't be that way. I'm so sorry you had to experience that... I've been in that position multiple times, but the opposite. Im ftm and guys scare the actual shit out of me so yeah.
Im so sorry this happened to you, chief. That person is absolutely horrible and they deserve only the pain they cause on others. Dont feel bad you couldnt react, I wouldnt have been able to either. I hope you manage to get over this distress one day at a time

One thing I like to do when a thing awful like this happens is use the 10 rule. Is it going to hurt in 10 minutes? Probably. In 10 hours? I dont know. In 10 days? I dont know. In 10 years? Certainly not. It makes it easier to remember bad things pass too
Break out your phone, record and cancel her ass.

I fear Exactly something like this to happen so i use inva-wc... and also im sorry it happened to you. Cis people are trashy most of the times
Well I guess it‚Äôs time for a staring contest
I hate when people act like that((( Like we are not persons at all(
[removed]
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Normally I'm the kind of bitch that will make a scene but I know what it's like to be in your own head and feeling some feels from something else and having that strip away your will to stand up for one's self. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà stay strong
Bitch would‚Äôve had the right one if I was there because I would‚Äôve fucking made a scene and made her feel really fucking stupid and let her know about herself
You should have pushed past.
Not sure of the legality but the karma result - her getting peed on...
Next time it happens just shove through
If we see this kind of thing happening, what can a cis woman do to help?

My first instinct would be to pretend like I know you and then go in with you, kind of like how one does when they're trying to keep creeps off of other girls at the bar.  Would that help, or would it make it worse?
Imagine being the person who goes out of their way to ""guard"" the mall restroom
Depending on the state/country she may have just committed a felony. Her ass could use some time in prison
tell me where she is and I will hit a bitch.
on a more serious note, I‚Äôm really sorry that happened to you. people can be so awful.
Ugh. That's really shitty. As if we need more shit to shadowbox in the shower about.

As a person who has been shy pretty much my whole life, long before coming out as trans, I get it. I am not very happy with my voice, and I definitely tend to limit talking to people in certain situations, especially when on my own. And in that situation, its like you don't wanna give that shrew any more ammunition.

Awesome that you have a friend to vent with and who sounds ready to back you up though! Keep ya head up girl!
So YOU have to go in the mens and feel uncomfortable just so she can do what? Thats fucking outrageous, you need to stand up for yourself!
I know i should have held my ground but I was already kinda shaken that day and just wants ready for any type of confrontation, i just needed to pee
kick her through the door into the restroom üòÇ just kidding. but in my fantasy it is totally worth it
Reminds me of the little girl soccer player who was/is constantly criticized and her team was held from competing in some competitions because people thought she was a boy. People were wanting her genitals to be inspected by a physician to prove she was a girl. She's cis, though, she just had short hair.
I would and I kinda did before when a shopkeeper was harassing him with invasive questions.
If I may, she was acting very *jerk*.
Um...
Please know that I'm cis, but I had a similar experience back when I was a little girl.

And it was because of a stupid haircut. People have it in their minds that the haircut shows one's gender... which is stupid because I dated a man who wore a braid in his long hair.

(edited to add on to the end of the comment)
Im destroying cis women's rights by wanting to not be hate crimed? I see...
Hippity Hoppity prepare to be downvoted
I believe that would help, but I didn't have anyone to ask for that with me, i was the only girl in my friends group at that moment. My transmasc friend offered me this favor before a few months ago because he is early in transition but I don't think it's fair to him for me to keep asking, he didn't care back then because h still felt safer in the woman's restroom.
I really don't know, I'm not in the us
I'm not saying what you did was wrong in anyway and I'm truly sorry that you experienced it, and i hope you won't have to face this again (but i would say that i might have helped you to get your friend involved)
God I just want to give you a hug, I hope you never have to experience this ever again, if I was there I would‚Äôve screamed at that nasty bitch. Virtual hugs you gorgeous lady ü•∞ü•∞
There you go then homie. It can feel weird to let your siblings stick up for you, but they want to show you that love the same way you do

"Did you ocasionally frequently ""misgender"" yourself when you came out as trans/begin your transition?"	"That's really just a silly question of mine, no story involved.

I've been open about being trans for around 2 months to some close friends, but sometimes when I'm too mad or burnt with something I still catch myself using the wrong pronouns.

Do you think this happens because I still have to go by male pronouns to most people?  


Edit: Ocasionally OR frequently\*"	"Yes, all the time. I misgender myself far too often
It's been kinda shameful because I keep deadnaming and misgendering myself but all my friends got my name and pronouns down pat right away. the worst I had was I changed my discord name and a few people didn't recognize me
Yes. I still do from time to time. And deadname myself inside my own head. 

It happens. It's like any other habit and isn't instantly broken and replaced.
I still do, usually when talking to medical or government officials. It's an instinctive form of self preservation, but every time I do it I die inside.
I don't anymore but it took awhile. Every time you misgender yourself; pause, correct, and move on with your thought. You'll get better at it. It definitely helps to have people use your name/pronouns but I had it down for myself before I socially transitioned.
I've only identified as trans for a few months and have been actively transitioning for 6 weeks And I still do it like once a week üôÑ
I‚Äôve rarely referred to myself by pronouns. So that‚Äôs never been much of an issue. But after 2 years I‚Äôm still misgendering myself in my head all the damn time and referring to myself by my old name.
Sometimes I do mentally but I usually correct myself pretty quickly.
i did at the beginning of transition because i kept forgetting who i had come out to and was playing it safe, happens less now
Sometimes. It's generally pretty rare.

Most recently was when I was fighting with my wife I misgendered the shit out of myself. I kinda associate my anger with boy me so it's probably unhealthy but I dealt with it that way. Definitely really upsetting to my wife to hear that.
I did it for a while. I've been out for a year now and now I consistently gender myself correctly without effort. The *starting point* for me personally was no longer viewing myself as a boy trying to be a girl, but as a girl who had a birth defect who made her body grow as a boy's does. That's not required by any means but it sure helped me. 

I'm also not publicly out yet, so I often have to misgender myself in public contexts or deal with being misgendered. I've managed to make my personal view of myself stick enough that even *that* doesn't effect me. 

Having trouble with that is common and it's no reflection on you. You've been trained to see and refer to yourself one way for your whole life and you have to recalibrate your perspective. Good topic OP ^.^
I've been he/him for 29 years. She/they fulltime for 4 months. Ima fuck it up all the time for at least a year or two.
Yup I definitely did, habits are hard for anyone to break! Hell I probably still do it from time to time.
i'm not even sure how this would work
I only accepted I was trans recently (less than a month) and I still catch myself.  It's mostly thinking in terms of me as a part of ""the guys"" and not ""the girls"".  So almost all mental.  I have had sometimes where the few people I am out to use my pronouns and I'm like ""who?  Oh, me.""
I mean, I notice it every time. But, yes.

What's even worse, is I'll misgender myself infront of people I'm out to on accident.

And then do the opposite on accident to people I'm not out to.

So, yes. I am a mess. Life is strange.
I've been out to myself for 3 months and it still doesn't feel real. I have to force myself to use the proper words and pronouns because doing so feels like a mockery of what it should.
Yeah, all the time at the beginning. I'm now 11 months in, and I can't remember the last time since I misgendered myself. Although I still find trouble asserting myself publicly as she/her, mostly due to fear of transphobic responses.
lol, beginning? I‚Äôm 3 years on hrt and still do it.
Not that much. Portuguese allows you to be gender neutral 100% of the time. So I just did that.
All the time! Don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it. Your brain was conditioned for YEARS UPON YEARS to refer to itself a certain way. It takes time to untangle those wires.
yea, i do that all the time. idk why but for some reason, as much as my deadname and my agab makes me physically cringe to think about, i continue to use them for myself, especially when i‚Äôm mentally worn down. im assuming it‚Äôs some form of emotional self harm for some? (but judging on the comments of others, it‚Äôs also just a force of habit)
I kinda have to a lot as in the early stages not everybody will even believe you. just gotta grow out my VERY slowly growing hair and shave and I‚Äôll be good.
i did it for the first 6 months before everything kind of clicked. ""one of the boys"", ""guy"", crap like that. takes a while for your brain to accept it without having to think about it
Yes, I hate it
I haven‚Äôt started dreaming with my name and pronouns yet if that counts.
I find that the past really gets me. 

I seem to have hard-coded myself as dude in my memories, so I‚Äôve absolutely misgendered myself. Feels weird.
Yes. I still do in my head occasionally because I spend 40 years with she/her. So even though he/him feels correct, I still autopilot/autocorrect wrongly occasionally.  

Likewise, I‚Äôm dyslexic and sometimes fear that I will misspell my name because of its newness. Luckily I haven‚Äôt, but it crosses my mind and I double check.
  Definitely when I first came out. Lately not as much, but I've had a good few years to adjust (being out socially and hearing other people actually use the correct name/pronouns helps). I think there's a bit of disconnect at first because you have other voices around you still using your old name and such, and haven't grown to recognize the correct name yet! Like when a puppy is learning to recognize their name.
It's been almost a year since my egg cracked, 9 months since I started hormones, and 6 months since I started full-timing, and I still misgender myself sometimes lmao. But I'm getting better about it for sure. I imagine by this time next year it'll be pretty rare.
Been on HRT for 5 months, *still* do it sometimes. I'll be reading something about a guy being oblivious or not trying or doing the bare minimum and I'll reflexively think ""I'm glad I'm a better guy than that"" before my brain catches up
It happen sometimes
It used to happen a lot at first but not much now. It's different for me though cause I speak Icelandic, which is a very gendered language. For example all adjectives are either male or female, and so when I'd be saying anything about myself I would be used to saying the *wrong* gender.
Yea, i experience this quite a lot and all i can say is the more people gender you correctly and you in your head gender yourself correctly your subconscious will accept it quicker if that makes sense

Just keep trying and eventually you'll be fine in my experience anyway:))
i‚Äôm 6 months on hormones, been out for longer and still find myself using my deadname and he/him pronouns

all part of the cycle, apparently /j
I used to accidentally misgender myself in daydreams cuz ppl were still using the wrong pronouns for me. I started correcting myself cuz it would make me feel like crap thinking about those who don‚Äôt respect my pronouns. Only time I do purposely misgender myself is when it‚Äôs playfully misgendering myself (like looking in the mirror and saying ‚Äòooh she lookin cute today‚Äô n crap like that). I don‚Äôt allow that from other people tho because part of me will always wonder what their intentions actually were n if they actually don‚Äôt see me for me. It‚Äôs better to just avoid it by having them respect my pronouns.
Literally constantly. My wife genders me with a higher accuracy than I do.
Oh yes! My brain fog ensures that I will generally mess up all the pronouns, mostly my own. I just got good at correcting myself quickly and people rarely really notice.
I sometimes misgender myself when meeting people who my older sibling went to high school with or a teacher that they had
Still doing it a year and a half later...but oh well.
I am going to therapy with a psychologist. I am using he/him pronouns.. but is because I don't feel comfortable using she /her pronouns just yet with her.
The only one that calls me with she/her pronouns is my wife.
Yes mostly in my head, bc I‚Äôm so used to it.
I misgender myself in my head all the time. It‚Äôs hard cuz I have a constant internal dialog that likes to be 3rd person and so it‚Äôs common that I use she or my other name than he or Mark.
Yes
I honestly never thought about myself by deadname and honestly I am surprised it took 22 years for me to crack.
Actually, no I don't
Even though people who don't know I'm trans are talking to me, I don't misgender and deadnamimg myself (when it comes to talking, obv, I have no other option)
Yeah, sadly. It pretty much only happens when I say like gendered words like ''prince'' ''king'' and that type of stuff yk. it happens to all of us homie, dw.
I‚Äôve been out with friends for about 2 years now and i rarely do anymore but for the first year after i came out i‚Äôd misgender myself pretty often, it takes some time to get used to correctly gendering yourself.
It improved for me once I started hearing the new pronouns across the board and not just from a few close folks! But yes- it DEF happened. It‚Äôs and adjustment and it passed for me in time!!!!!
I found it REALLY helpful to correct myself outloud when I did... so yeah I might haveü•∫... did
Yes, and I still do, but I'm tryna fight with it and every day I'm more and more referring to myself as a man. Misgendering one's self is normal if you realized you're trans not a very long time ago, since all of your life you've been referred to as your agab, and you're so used to it
You know how in the first few months of the year, everyone often writes down the wrong year out of habit? It's something like that, just at a larger scale.
for me, its just the imposter syndrome, or i feel like i don‚Äôt deserve to be called a lady, its a hard mentality to break but, always trying to break free from the forced masc since birth, dont beat yourself up about it, it takes time even for you to adjust, you‚Äôre vaild! im proud of you
All the time, even 8-ish (I think?) years into HRT.  Just remember most of us have still spent more of our lives using the old/wrong pronouns.  

Possibly off topic, but one that helped me care less when  my inner dialogue bothered me-

I saw a discussion a linguist had defending internet speak, and they said that language is wild.  All words are just made up sounds in a specific order to help transmit an idea or mental image to someone else.  It doesn't matter what that sound it is as long as that mental image is transmitted.  That's why if you forget a word and say complete gibberish the other person will likely still understand you.  You're used to one sound representing that mental image, now you're replacing that with a new one, like learning a new language.  Even bilingual people constantly use a word from language A when they're speaking language B because their brain just happened to supply that one first.
God yes. I‚Äôve been out for 2/3 months and i keep mentally doing it. The worst part is my inner voice is still my old voice so it definitely leads to imposter syndrome and dysphoric feelings. 

I just try and tell myself that these things take time and i‚Äôll get there :)
It's very normal. I still occasionally dream I'm a guy and I'm coming up to three years.

Eventually it'll pass as time goes on
As bad as it sounds in general, I aim to relate (partially) to the discord part. I've been thinking that when I end up coming out to public it'll be easier to just abandon all of my social networks and start them anew. As to why is sort of a long story, but I guess it's not hard to assume the reason.
I know it's rare to refer to yourself with pronouns because we hardly use sentences in third person or refer to ourselves this way (unless we're correcting someone I guess?). Also because most english words are gender neutral I suppose, but in my language a TON of adjectives and such are gendered, so it happens way often than I expected while I'm speaking to others or rambling to myself

Also, I'm saying this guessing english is your main language. Sorry if it's not
Fuck
Thanks :\^)
Is this a r/suddenlycaralho?
In my case it was more funny because they started talking to me like ""oh hey it's okay you're new here, right?"" 
I hope you can find a safe way to come out when you're ready to
It is. Yeah gendered languages are a totally foreign concept to me. I‚Äôm sure I would do it much more if I spoke a language like that.
Why fuck?
I mean, while it sucks it's also good training. Because even though I let it out by accident sometimes, I'm quick to correct myself. So maybe this one particularity helps me get used to it.
Sad that you would treat yourself like that, and sad that your partner has to see that. Reminds me of my unhealthy ex
Yeah I can see that. I suppose when a language doesn‚Äôt do that you run into what we have right now in the states. Which is people stumbling and struggling over the idea of using they/them instead of gendered pronouns.
Def unhealthy. I'm still working through some of my issues."	rgc603	trans	430	0.99	2021-12-14 17:13:07
My mom wont accept me :(	"Before i really knew what was going on with my identity I came out to my mom (about 2 years ago) and admitted I wanted to be more a guy‚Ä¶ kinda. (For reference Im AFAB nonbinary but I use male names and pronouns.) I explained that I pretty much wanted to be a guy save for the gentitals and maybe no HRT. 

She didn‚Äôt understand and was upset- not mad, but really sad. She said she was worried about me and any time Ive brought up my gender since then she talks about how i could just be a butch lesbian, or i‚Äôm confused by my trans friends, or it could just be a phase, yadda yadda yadda. 

Despite her being the only ally in the house, (my dad and sister are both Extreme republicans, as is most of my family) I feel less and less safe being myself around her. Just yesterday when I said i wanted an androgynous haircut she said she ‚Äúdidnt like when i talked like that.‚Äù 

I dont know what to do. I have a binder now, and I havent told her. My therapist has been really helpful, but it sucks knowing that when i really ramp up my transition in college she‚Äôs probably gonna hate it."	"yeesh. that sucks hard. it sucks that people like that exist at all. im here for you, dude
In college?! Jeez, you're a grown person!
and ""just be a butch lesbian"" is absolutely hillarious in a really sad way.
i‚Äôm sorry :( i hope she comes around
I‚Äôm sorry. You deserve better.

You deserve a family that sees, loves and accepts *you*, not their conception of who they wish you were.

You deserve a family that celebrates you finding yourself, and living in accordance with who you are.

They should be proud of the non-binary son (you said you use male names/pronouns so I hope this word is correct - if not, please let me know and I‚Äôll edit it!) they have, rather than a ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù who never actually existed.

The fact their hate means they wont see the real you is a profound loss for them, and very sad for you.

My wife and I offer mom-hugs.
My mom was exactly the same when i started my transition including the whole ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you just be a lesbian?‚Äù question but over time it really does get better. Sometimes your parents need more time because they‚Äôre also transitioning to knowing your authentic self. it can be hard for parents at times because they aren‚Äôt as educated so all you can do is be yourself and talk to your mom and therapist together. It will take time but trust me it will be worth it. Really just give it time and be understanding of her side. I know you‚Äôre also struggling but it can be a big change for parents who knew you as someone else before your transition. Her being kinda off put about the haircut could be her way of keeping you safe because of your conservative family. I had the same issue with my mom where she worried about my safety around my dad.
You do you. Live for you. Your mom can ride this ride how she wants and if it‚Äôs too damaging‚Ä¶the rank of family is earned. It‚Äôs not by blood. Relation is all that is. Who is family? I‚Äôm growing mine by having people who see me for me and nothing else. It‚Äôs a small family but it‚Äôs growing.

I had to cut my mom and dad out for several years.. My dad is the big jerk in my situation and my mom is finally on my side but she still doesn‚Äôt fully understand. I doubt she ever will.

My dad at least talks to me now but it‚Äôs superficial. Kind of like our entire relationship growing up to this point. 

He‚Äôs an ass and I think everyone will be heart broken when he‚Äôs gone but I won‚Äôt. Am I cold? Maybe. Maybe I hold a resentment towards being called an abomination.

You can gradually just prove to your mom that you know who you are by living how you need to live and then thrive.
Live for you find a way to not go home for summers and holidays.
My boyfriend is in a similar boat but it‚Äôs his Aunt who was supportive, it‚Äôs just an especially unfortunate time for trans people in conservative families with Fox and News Max ginning up more hate
I'm sorry you have to go through this. I'm the parent of a trans teenager. I love my child no matter what. That's what love is. I hope things get better for you soon. Sending love.
Well once she is old and reliant on you. you can just not be there she didn‚Äôt support you so you don‚Äôt support her
Same
Tell er your nonbinary
thank you qwq
yep :‚Äô) im gonna be a senior in school this year and my mom is STILL super overbearing on me
thank you, i hope she can see its hurting me
(son is correct, yes :) ) and thank you, youre both very kind and this means a lot qwq
So in her eyes you‚Äôre old enough to choose what you are going to do for the rest of your life but not how you are going to do it.

It kinda sounds like she is actually concerned for the loss of the future she had planned for you rather than you. And the haircut statement is screaming fear of the perception and judgment of others. These are all her problems not yours.
Thats pretty much how she is :/ i think its called ‚Äúcis grieving‚Äù or whatever but she is constantly obsessed with protecting me by making me as closeted as possible- no clothes, hair, whatever that might make someone know im queer. it sucks :/"	wtg5uq	trans	400	0.98	2022-08-20 20:05:33
A Message to All Trans People in The U.S	"I'm afraid for my and all other trans people's safety  This world is against us

The U.S. keeps getting worse and worse I have seen no improvement.

My state of Illinois is safe and has been,

 but everywhere else seems completely screwed.  Texas is bordering on genocidal actions and Florida's banning of care for trans youth. Arkansas proposed a bill banning GAC for anyone under 26 The spike in anti-trans violence and rhetoric. So much more  Land of the free. That's a straight-up lie.  We preach civil liberty whilst oppressing large groups 

We've seen book burnings, dehumanizing rhetoric, and legislation targeting minorities before.  The 1930's in Germany specifically. Then Minority's warning of what was to come was seen as paranoia and the ramblings of the mad.  

Now trans individuals are treated much the same. Like loons and freaks. They wouldn't listen before, and they won't listen now. Sadly we must fight. Fight for our lives, lest we lose them at the hands of our oppressors.  We must fight any way we know how, but be careful. Your actions now could be used to further demonize us. Tread carefully.  Vandalise and deface the property of bigots.   Leave a message  Make it strong

Make it noticeable  


I felt I needed to say it"	"Oklahoma has a bill to ban trans care for anyone under 26. I think Arkansas' bill was for under 18. So the situation is actually slightly worse which sucks
Peacefully trying to fix things doesnt work, peaceful protests and trying to ""talk"" to nazis don't work, nazis should be afraid of being nazis

You don't progress with peacefully talking with a nazi over tea, they don't deserve respect from anyone, much less from the people they are trying to kill

(This is not directed at OP, I agree with OP's sentiment)
Dear US-based transphobes who I know are lurking here: Thank you for paying your taxes so Veterans like myself can have access to gender affirming care through the VA
I would like to add to OP's stance but add Colorado to the safe zone... we are guaranteed to control the state government for at least another decade. It's a safe haven for LGBTQ+ people. üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàüíØüíúüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüåàüëç‚ùÑÔ∏èüèÇüåÑü§ü‚õ∞Ô∏è
Basically everything I wanted to say has been said. Even as a cis person I feel scared and want to leave the country before it becomes fascist. Please arm yourselves.
We have to organize.  If we try to deal with this as individuals, we will fail, and the consequences are life and death.  I have already started implementing my exit plan from the U.S. as a contingency plan.  

I'm in a fairly friendly state, and I am planning a sizeable add on to my house in case I need to even temporarily house refugees.
It's insane that I have been telling people this will happen over and over and over and my mom after I actually shared several links over whats going on to let people know lately actually has the audacity to ask me whats wrong. The cis do not care. They just don't. It's not being talked about, it's barely being covered by them so we just do not matter and frankly it terrifies me that even if we did fight back they'd just tell us to get on the cattle cars because it's scaring them to think they would ever have to fight or be uncomfortable.

Just look how they acted when people tried to defend the drag queen bars and you would see comments saying how people with guns are just making it worse and that we would be jeopardizing everyone. We do not matter in their eyes and are only an afterthought.

The irish had the troubles, we have the concerns. Because that's all we are, a concern, a background thought. I try to be optimistic but I can't be right now.
we need to start arming ourselves and protecting ourselves a gay bar was attacked and a gay restaurant had a brick thrown at the window. this isn't new to our people but we need to start self protecting our community. the govt doesn't want to protect us the govt gang(cops) doesn't wanna protect us. it's up to us to protect each other now and im afraid as a trans woman it'll get worse
People are attempting more desperate measures against us because we‚Äôve been making progress, and these sorts of bill (which keep getting proposed, then failing) can help open people‚Äôs eyes to the fact that those who are against us are actively trying to kill is and get them to help us. There‚Äôs one major step you can take to help: **Tell allocishets in your life about this shit, most of them don‚Äôt know, and when they do, they usually get more vocal about supporting us. They won‚Äôt fight for us, but once they realize our lives are on the ballot, most will vote for us.** Progress is being made, things are getting better. It‚Äôs just a very painful process.
In Arkansas you can drink, drive, vote, etc and do whatever the hell you want but now you‚Äôre not mature enough for GAC
America is dead to me. Honestly I don't think anything can save it. 

The worst part is the fact that the toxicity from America is spreading across the border. We've had mass shootings when shit like that never happened here. We're supposed to be better than America not sink to their level. 

At least we haven't back peddled on human rights like you all have. Yet.
I think someone said, that there aren't enough trans people to go full blown Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Movement. One would need to unite every Person under the LGBT+ Label in the U.S. And then I'm not sure if it would be enough.

Of course one could start a counter campaign. Propaganda Posters, Fake News, Fear-Mongering. Kinda using the same stuff they use to unite our people against them. But neither are we that well funded, nor do I think it would work honestly..

But the age of talk and winnning them over through discorse has ended..  it is a war, it is funded, it has a purpose and a goal..

And I don't know what can be done to counter it. Propaply getting armed? Capitalism wins again. Arm both sides and collect per bullet.

I think this will either blow over like every fear campaign has before or it will go ballistic.

In which case: man the barricades, keep the degenerates away from the trans children. We see who kills who, fascist!

I hope this wont happen.. fucking 21 century.
I'm finna grab a couple aks a couple 12 gauges, a couple 9mms and probably a.couple rugs to protect my trans sister
My wife is in prison in Florida and I'm in Oregon. We're petitioning to have her sentence transferred here because she's not safe from the guards there
Thank you! Yes, everyone is needed for unifying against this horrible political trend! It
Keeps spreading to other states and is getting more and more extreme!
With the US burning like this, is Canada truly as good as it sounds? Is that the new safe-haven for all living in the US to move to?
Eventually it'll get to a point where they'll create so many laws, that it'll box in cis people who need access to gender care for other reasons or who don't strictly conform to gender norms.
I wish I could leave but the U.S makes it nearly impossible if you aren't rich which is another issue entirely. I hate this country. ""Land of the free"" my ass.
Good luck and stay safe out there
For anyone looking to flee their state, Trans Activist and mom Erin Reed created a map that shows the best and worst states for trans people. 

[https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/the-final-anti-trans-legislative](https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/the-final-anti-trans-legislative)

If you‚Äôre looking to flee the US entirely, the easiest place to go would be Canada, due to the proximity of the country and also has some great protections for trans people, but there are still issues there. Do your research for where you wanna go!

Personally I live in Alabama and I plan on leaving as soon as I finish my degree.
Massachusetts is still a safe haven as is much of VT.
Personally I love trans women/men. Everyone no matter who they identify as or who they like to sleep with is a human,and deserve the same rights as anyone else. No further discussion should be needed!!!
I had to flee Arkansas last year. I was in a small, very insular town, and the amount of transphobic stuff people would spout on the daily was insane. I was in the closet, for obvious reasons, but I had to go because they were starting to sound serious in their threats of ""damnation"".
""It's a big club, and you ain't in it!""

--George Carlin
I think the problem with that strategy is it adds fuel to the fire. Nobody is going to get their shit wrecked and think ""maybe I was wrong about those people"". They'll double down, it'll end up on Fox News, etc.
I'm thankful Maryland is alright for now, though it sucks that my (thankfully cis) girlfriend lives in Texas
What‚Äôs important is that we rely on each other, and be lighter than a feather
While I agree that the US government needs to pull its head in, vandalisation and defacing of property will push those neutral to the other side of the arguement. And given that this community is tiny compared to the population, a civil war is also not the answer, especially given the power of the US armed forces. 

Any attempt at physical action like civil war will only cause those who are agressive towards this minority to believe without a doubt that they are in the right and help them convince others.

You need allies that can support you in the court of public opinion and the abilty to change an economy(thus you need large amounts of people and those who are better off economically). In other words, you need both powerful and large amounts of people to support you so the government has to listen. (Think about how segregation and racism was almost entirely eliminated, minus certain parts of the populace.)

TLDR; you will not win a civil war, think logically and politically, get as many people of all across the spectrum to side with you enough to cause a social, political and economic movement in the culture of the United States.
‚ÄúDr. King's policy was that nonviolence would achieve the gains for black people in the United States. His major assumption was that if you are nonviolent, if you suffer, your opponent will see your suffering and will be moved to change his heart. That's very good. He only made one fallacious assumption: *In order for nonviolence to work, your opponent must have a conscience. The United States has none.*‚Äù

We are fucked and the public refuses to see it  
They want us dead I swear it.

Sorry for that. I'm going to go and lay down  
  
Sorry for making you cry.  
  
It all just makes me sick.  
  
Gonna cry now.  
  
Thank you for being here for me
Arm yourselves as heavily as local law allows
Fuck the US

Goodnight   
To all see you all whenever I guess
Spreading this shit around. I want as many of us as possible to read my rant. It needs to be done
Remember that this is happening in many regions of the US  (not only in the South, as many still believe).

They want us dead
I'm in the same state, Chicago is the only widely democratic (aka trans friendly-ish) part of Illinois, the rest is redneck ass transphobic mf's. I honestly hate living in lower Illinois. [Edit: there's also hardly trans help groups in the rural areas. I feel completely lost, I hate this state, country, and sometimes the whole damn world.]
I agree that govt things r bad and things seem to be getting worse, but idk homie, ‚ÄúTexas is bordering on genocidal actions‚Äù seems like exaggeration to me. I‚Äôd love to see evidence to the contrary if u have it. I‚Äôm not saying things r good for us there, but I do think it‚Äôs important not to make things sound worse than they r, u know? Like Texas isn‚Äôt setting up trans person death camps or anything, they‚Äôre just fucking hella w laws that will cause death and misery, but not on a mass scale equivalent to genocide. Also, I‚Äôve found that ppl matter a lot more than politics. Politicians can do a lot of harm, but the ppl who live around us r the ones that really affect us imo. It‚Äôs chill if I get downvoted for this, I‚Äôm just giving my thoughts as a trans girl.
I live in AR. I NEED to transition one if the reasons I quit trying to commit suicide is so I could transition. If I can't do that what reason I have to live?
I'm pretty sure Colorado is another state that is safe. I know they have protection laws for trans people.
Now is the time to get to a safe blue state. Colorado and Illinois are great options if you can't get to the coasts. At the very least, have a plan if these laws are passed. It's super expensive to move, especially across the country, but the net safety gain is well worth it.
I should probably stay up to date on the topic, but does anyone know how bad it is in Pennsylvania?
My heart breaks for my trans siblings in the us every time a new bill is announced. I'm privileged to live in a country where my rights are not attacked and I wish I could do more to help y'all.
Lots of love from your west-European sibling and stay safe
Not in the U.S., but transphobia here is pretty high as well. Being peaceful doesn't help with transphobia itself at all. It only amplifies all the narration against us, which is broadcasted by priests, gov-owned media and right-wing politicians regardless of the party. The only thing why transgenders aren't the main target is that this government is more ""concerned"" about harassing females at all, no matter whether cisgender or transgender. 

However, peaceful informing still helps with trans-friendly initiatives and spreads a word about them.
It's sadly even worse, [Oklahoma has another bill on the docket that is a de facto ban on gender affirming care. For all ages. ](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB250/2023) 

Most if not all of them will get struck down but it's scary as fuck. Seeing your own humanity debated is not a great feeling.
Damn Thanks mixed them up
Church $ at work ! Its how they network.
I can't help but be reminded of Charlie Chaplin's speech from ""The Good Dictator"". I feel like its more relevant now than ever. I wish I had a way to broadcast it to a lot of people, I would have hope that it could change some minds
Armed self defense now
Martin Luther King Jr. was both peaceful and effective.  Not being peaceful could make things way worse for us.  Our generation may not see change.  But, let's represent peace for future generations, at least.
Me too! I truly appreciate old me‚Äôs service now lol
This is what taxes should be for.
Same here, thx yall
You‚Äôre not helping.  Transphobes are morons.  Don‚Äôt do their mental labor for them.
I agree with this! While I don‚Äôt live in CO rn, I have family there and grew up there! A lot of my family since I came out has come to me and said ‚Äúif you ever need to, you know you can come to us and we‚Äôll help you.‚Äù So even if shit hits the fan in my current state, I know I‚Äôll have somewhere safe to go. Honestly I friggin love Colorado.
Most of New Mexico is safe too.
New York is good...legally speaking. Stay out of the rural areas of course, cities are mostly fine.
Yes .Colorado is the best. I can always move back in with family in California if it gets bad here which I don‚Äôt foresee
As long has Big Gretch is office, Michigan is relatively safe as well! Especially in the Metro Detroit/Ann Arbor areas
I‚Äôve always wanted to move there, even before I knew it‚Äôs a safe haven. Hopefully I can move there someday
Oh dang as someone in the middle of arkansas I feel terrified to imagine myself as a fucking refugee having to leave my home despite its flaws.
We have to make some noise and disrupt. You can try to ignore the elephant in the room by looking away, but not when it shrieks in your face

Or as Miles Bron, fiction‚Äôs professional idiot, would put it, we have to go past what people are comfortable with and double down
But the LGBT community is too scared of guns or any method of self defense to actually fight, so we will likely all get jailed and tortured eventually because nobody in this community is going to actually take decisive action.
You‚Äôre completely right about this! I don‚Äôt live in the US thank god, but I managed to get my dad to see how bad things were getting even in our own country just by mentioning a few examples. It‚Äôs easy to feel like the world is against us, but most people‚Äôs hearts are in the right place, they just need some help moving their brains to that place as well. Gathering allies is vital, and it‚Äôs not quite as insurmountable a task as it might seem, provided you don‚Äôt waste time on the wrong people of course
Oklahoma I messed up but they proposed a bill that would in short ban GAC for under those 26   


The scary part is I can see how it might get voted into law.
If you're talking about Canada, y'all are just as bad as us, y'all just lie to yourselves about it. You do remember any the whole ""Indigenous Women"" situation, right? And y'all are just as transphobic and homophobic too.
I love the counter campaign idea.
Look up North Dakota‚Äôs proposed SB2199. So extreme, scary and oppressive!
theres many ways to fight, you dont have to go out and literally assault someone. Nazis need to be afraid to publicly hold their ideology. period. These are people who literally don‚Äôt want us to exist.
Then we need to make any violence against us as too much for the majority of Americans. We need to stop letting them argue our existence and instead force them to explicitly come out against us.
They backed off of black people because they‚Äôre afraid.  They don‚Äôt know any language but fear.  They prove it every single day.  In their mind, if you don‚Äôt scare them then you‚Äôre fair game to target.  They only understand predators and prey; nothing else.

The first pride was a line of people throwing bricks.
X and Newton did more for civil rights than King. The suffragettes were violent too.

Nothing ever changes by peaceful protests.
Yup. Like I feel the energy but it‚Äôs just not gonna help
How can this be done you ask? Use what we have available to us, social media, a mix of kindness and maybe a bit of painting those who wish harm against  monorities as monsters(without them knowing of course). Cator to the neutral, do not be extreme, don't give those who wish harm ammunition to use against you.

There is so much more that can be done, only ever increasing with every addition to both sides.

In general, yeah those are more progressive areas. The west coast has a loooot of rural and conservative area that is often overlooked however.

It's getting Natzi Like
What's the speech?
I also want peace, that doesn't mean we shouldn't fight and protest

Continue on the ""just talking"" will get more and more people killed, nowhere in history people were able to revolutionize history by just having friendly talks with the people that were killing them
Also

Protesting and standing up for our rights ‚â† being violent 

It just means that we need to fight for our rights, and if we are attacked by the people that want to opressor us that we need to fight against them, not quietly, not sitting down and talking, but in the streets, making noise, having our voices heard

You cited MLK, but MLK also said that he wasn't against protests and peaceful protesting was not about keeping our heads down and quietly speaking, it was about fighting for rights, screaming and walking in the streets, witouth resorting to violence 


We still need our voices heard, trying to pretend that we can talk with those people won't really help and will just make the future generation have to deal with more problems we left for them, just like the last generatio left us problems


And vandalizing the property of bigots and etc ‚â† violence so
Wish people would stop repeating silliness about MLK such as this.

Keeping your head down has a time and place when someone is actively trying to harm you is not it.
This is a pretty whitewashed stance. The only reason King was able to be effective with peace was because his contemporaries were willing to use force. He was seen as the ""sensible moderate"", but even he admitted that his protests would have fallen on deaf ears had it not been for the more militant tactics of Malcom X or the Black Panthers, among others. King didn't succeed despite them, he succeeded BECAUSE of them.
Yeah, then he was shot and riots broke out forcing congress's hand to put out a civil rights act that's still allowed systemic racism to mount to this vary day.

MLK Jr. is a figure head and a focal point. Had he not been the reasonable offering versus the looming threat of widespread civil unrest, he wouldn't have been capitulated to.
Always means the world to be so accepted and loved within the community. <3 thanks friend!
We're at the point where it is not fear mongering.
I'm in Arkansas as well In the northwest part and this is all getting a little scary. I knew sanders was going to do this though. May be time to look at moving elsewhere
it might be for the best, esp for our trans brothers and sisters
I get you, I had to flee Arkansas myself last year. I know it's scary to leave but, at this point, it's getting dangerous to stay. At least set up an escape route. I'll remind you that the ""gay panic"" defense is still legal in Arkansas.
I finally managed to escape Arkansas last summer. Now living in SF and have already made it clear to several of my trans friends from back home that I would help them settle in out here.
ur right our apathy and weakness is why we are so easily pushed around
Unfortunately friend, if you don't live in the USA, you don't know how little this applies. People in the USA don't give a fuck about each other. Human life is cheap here and problems are almost always solved with bullets. And cis people do not give a single, solitary fuck. They hate us. They are not only ok with us being murdered, many of them actively want it. Even so called allies are tepid little bitches that won't do shit to help us. Most won't even show up at a protest, even with no danger to themselves. They've got their own selfish concerns. They don't care. We are entirely on our own.
We have an alt right but they're not the majority. Your country are just a bunch of arseholes who are proud of smelling like the shit they are.
Sure, but we would need artists for anti-right posters and the like. We could also use animators for education videos on the rising threat of naziism in the U S. Doesn't matter if it is exaggerated or not. Thats how this shit works. We would also need people who can write articels. Like when the right does something to the community, we fake news the shit out of it, just like they do with us. And then, if we want to get really dirty here, get some hackers and put smut on Ben Shepiro and Matt Walsh etc. Doxx them, hack them, get them out of the picture. One could try to take the daily wire down etc.

Basically.. fullblown transgender shadow activism.

But all of this shit would need financial funding. I don't have that kinda money. Nor would it be ethical. I don't know if we should care about ethics at this point. Thirdly it could make the situation worse by giving into the ""the wokes are attacking us"" mentality.

I don't know.

For riots we need to be united.
Me too. Standing in front of a tank without any weapon is a suicide. We have to fight, not to let them defeat us. And information war is still a war.
Unfortunately, Nazis are not afraid of anything short of physical violence. Often they aren't even afraid of that. These are scumbag, deplorable people who worship violence and murder and evil. They bathe in it. They drink it. They want to hurt you and everyone you love, and unless you're willing to put a bullet in them (assuming they attack you first and its self defense) they will put a bullet in you and think nothing of it whatsoever. And they figure, hey, if you fight back, they get to murder and beat you even harder, and then talk all about the deplorable violence of the ""trans agenda,"" while whitewashing their own mass murders and atrocities out of the picture. They engage in DARVO. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim Order. Deny that they are attacking you or that you are oppressed, attack you or your integrity, and reverse victim order to make themselves look like the oppressed victim, fighting for ""American values"" against the depraved, degenerate left. And the conservative right wing media is aiding and abetting them. Fox news and the daily wire are deplorable monstrosities who need to be punished. But there is no way to do so because they have a chokehold on the narrative about whose violence is legitimate and whose is not. AKA, Offensive violence by alt right fascist psychopaths? A-OK. Defensive violence by desperate trans folks just trying to survive to the next day? WOKE MOB. INTOLERANT LEFT.  


To be clear I am not endorsing physical violence here because it will only hurt our cause. As long as they control the propaganda machine and the narrative, neither violence nor non violence has any hope of working. The only way is to take control of the narrative first, to delegitimize their claim to legitimate violence.
We should unite. We can't work this while fractured. Do you have an idea on how we could get everyone together? A new Website, Forum, r/?
Northeast as well.

That's not at all what I'm saying.

I'm just trying to say we shouldn't resort to violence. That will only paint the targets on our backs even brighter.

Yes, talk, yes protest. But show them we do it peacefully and lovingly.
We need trans people to be a little less MLK, and a little more Malcom X.
I'm not saying that we stick our heads in the sand, at all, nor did MLK.

I'm saying let our voices AND actions represent peace as well as the disparity and discrimination we are facing.  Actions speak louder than words.  Let their own words prove them wrong by our peaceful, but vocally strong united peaceful existence
What is silly about anything I said about MLK?

I'm saying we have to fight our battles wisely, especially for future generations.  We can't get up in arms and expect them to return peace in response.
I respectfully disagree.  The militant movements were happening alongside his.  And he consistently disavowed the other approaches.  He always tried to make things peaceful.

I see what you're saying, but I sincerely don't think he levied, intentionally or not, the contrast to his advantage.

Do we really want to paint the targets on our backs even brighter?  I say we show them that we are normal, peaceful citizens, living normal, quiet lives, and let time prove we were in the right, for future generations.
MLK's life, not death, inspires many to keep pushing forward, peacefully.  His death catapulted his message to cement the inspiration, which rallies the African American rights movement forever. Whatever happened after his death, the riots, was contrary to his message of peace.

Who was more effective and represented the movement more, him or Malcolm X?  Put it this way, which person has a Federal Holiday?

Our trans community should let peaceful representation contradict the way we're being portrayed, and violence never works in the long run for ours or future generations.

As a side note, I'm shocked the mods of this thread are allowing a continuation of violence discussion on this sub.  Aren't you guys violating Reddit terms of service by allowing this discussion?

No offense at all to any of you who disagree with me.

It's just that I'd rather die a martyr and help future generations than elevate the hatred against us by resorting to violence or vandalism, and be painted as the enemy any more in the media.
Of course! I know the feeling. <3
Yeah it's getting ridiculous the closest state to me is OK and that's not any better might have to go FAR
Oof. Honestly though I really feel like alot of ignorance is bred from lack of exposure and I'd hate to have to run for my own safety I'd like to believe I could put up with any mild harassment.  Been tough finding a job though...
It isn‚Äôt weakness to care for about other people and not want to hurt them, even if they hurt you.

Edit: (written concurrently with the response about apathy) and, it‚Äôs not apathy to feel disinclined to act in a society that has shown again and again that you are individually powerless to change it.

But, we can and will and do change it, just by being here and sometimes by acting together. As gloomy as things are right now, things are happening and when I look around, I see trans people fighting. This darkness is going to have to get a hell of a lot darker to make us stop.
Sounds like peaceful methods are not an option...
Alt right isn't the majority here either, but it is a shit hole, I'll give you that.
>Your country are just a bunch of arseholes who are proud of smelling like the shit they are.

I remember Canadian users on here laughing in our fucking faces during the bleakest days of the Pandemic. Your countrymen are every bit as capable of being vile assholes as mine.
I mean... I'm a trans artist. I might f around and find out. But I stay off most social media, so we'd need a coordinator.
Well, you'd need something that can't be shut down easily. So an entirely new website would probably be the best bet. With decoy sites and forums here and there. Right now though, I think reddit will do the job. Also, i'd say that physical locations to talk and communicate is a good idea(although both physical and digital can be dangerous) kind of like what the civil rights movements in the 60-70-80s did.

But you also need to think about what and who you are fighting for, that way you can have true united values so the other side of the arguement can't exploit the lack of unity.
Thanks!
I'm saving this
that was great
Okay you can protest peacefully and lovingly if you want but they won't hear us, they'll laugh at us 

Because the ones in power only hear what the don't want to hear when their position is being threatened or when we make enough noise
Yes!  


Burn things make them pay hold them hostage until they see
Any means necessary.
Your complete misunderstanding and misrepresenting of Malcom X is paralleled by your misunderstanding of political power. He was a great man and doesn't deserve to have his accomplishments belittled by you because you're judging him by the standards of a white supremacist country.

This isn't about great men of history. This is about political movements. By breaking down the civil rights movements into separate figure heads and pitting them against each other, you're missing the whole. It doesn't matter wether or not the riots are what MLK stood for. No one man, moment, or action encapsulates an ever evolving political movement.

Violence against a violent system is a defense mechanisms. If the political structures around us prey upon us, it is only right that we defend ourselves by whatever means necessary. And there are going to be times when it's necessary. Self defense is never something to be ashamed of.
Right. I'm close to Oklahoma as well but I'm just down the road from Missouri.  I was actually thinking of moving to Springfield but I don't think it's going to be any better than Arkansas honestly. May have to go all the way to Colorado or Illinois. Colorado would be my first choice.
It isn't your job to educate them, you don't have to put that on yourself. At this point, they're wilfully ignorant. They know how to learn, and they know where to find information, they just don't want to. If they understood, they'd have to empathize, and they don't want to do that. They'd rather just sit in their echo chamber. If those laws pass, you're in direct danger.
that's apathy and the reason why we are so easily harassed and targeted we will never stand for ourselves if we have the whole don't fight back mentality. care about other people?? idk of u noticed this or not it's not like they exactly want us to be alive so why should we care im not gonna let someone roll over me and pretend to care about them
Peaceful is certainly preferable as all violence does is reinforce their propaganda narrative of ""trans bad."" But we also are under no obligation to stand back as a community while our people are shot to death in bars and on the streets, throw up our hands, and say ""there's nothing we can do.""

An armed guard or two at all lgbt establishments might just send the message that we're ACTUALLY serious about it never happening again.

Being trained in firearms and nonlethal self-defense for those who can, protecting each other by making sure our siblings don't walk home alone or go off with strange men with ill intent, protesting loudly and proactively! All of these tactics are necessary. Depending on our own community for protection is going to be necessary as the social conditions can change rapidly and the state doesn't always have the best interests of LGBTQIA+ folks at heart, to say the least. Only we can help us.
No we don't solve our problems but killing eachother. Unfortunately the toxicity is spreading.
If you resort to violence, you'll end up in jail.  Then, your voice will definitely not be heard, but rather used against you and us
Violence begets violence.  Period.

My comparison of Malcolm X to MLK is being misunderstood.  I don't disagree that Malcolm X was a man of recognition.  But, go ask anyone, who was more influential and effective?  I'm not misunderstanding.  I'm old and wise and know what doesn't work.

I spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm post-op trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.  Do you think I was able to do any good for our cause when I was in solitary confinement?  I had a pencil and one call a day, only to numbers I had memorized.  And, I was non-violent.  Violent people are treated way worse.  I saw it to be true of a ""neighbor"" in jail.

We should never resort to violence.  Our future generations will be the ones suffering more than us.


Again, mods, why are you not stopping all this encouragement of violence?  I'm pretty sure you're in violation of Reddit's terms of agreement.

And, to everyone else including my responder, stop encouraging violence.  I can promise, from living almost 50 years of American history, that you're painting us into a corner that we don't want!  Live for the future generations and quit misrepresenting us!

Don't be who our aggressors want us to be.  It serves us no good.
CO all the way. I still just wish things would change I live where I am by choice I moved back here after living in San Francisco, LA. Denver, some pretty open minded places. And I just love the area I'm in. :( mah home
We are already considered as bad, just for existing. 
I don't know how it looks like in the States, but here insults and radical statements aimed at minorities (incl. transgender people) are allowed by society (mostly using a mechanism of ""they are like that, we can't do anything""), but revenge measures of the same degree are considered an attack. Like we've initiated that when we are only answering to their attack. 

However, I agree.
Except when the ""problem"" is the indigenous population, in which case, it's totally normal to shove their kids into torture centers disguised as schools, where they die in appalling numbers, get shoved into mass graves, and then spend the next 100 years jerking off about how much more progressive you are than your neighbors.
When did I say we had to use violence? Please stop trying to twist my words, my comment literally says that we should protests and yell, I never even talked about being violentnagainst people

You were the one that said we should do things ""lovingly and peacefully "" wich i don't agree, because non-violent protests ‚â† peaceful protests
Lmao, yeah, because it's not like the police won't raid our clubs on false pretenses if we just act nice and cordial.
St. Louis Illinois.  
On the Illinois side.  
I feel safe.  
But fear even that feeling of safety will be taken
Ok. If you want peace, let's advocate peace!
I've been to jail as a post-op trans woman, spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.

It's not fun. 

Your logic is broken, no offense.  They'll treat you way worse than they did me, if you resort to violence.

And violence would only work against us.  Don't resort to it.
>I've been to jail as a post-op trans woman, spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.

Do you think that has more to do with you being potentially violent or you being trans?
They told me it was because I've had surgery.  

They actually had two female officers inspect my genitalia and telling me why.

It was not due to violence on my part, but my protection.  I fully complied all along the way."	10ad3x2	trans	385	0.96	2023-01-12 22:37:56
I hate it when people think they know more about me then i do	"On social media many people decide to tell me what I am to me! Like saying i'm not trans because i use neopronouns and it/it's pronouns. Or saying i'm not a real man because I wear skirts amd dresses. It doesn't really affect me but it annoys me that people can really think that they know more about someone then they do. It's really stupid that you habe to go that far just to ""prove your point"". Another thing I see people say is that ""i'm too young to know what I am"" which makes me so mad! 

Sorry for the rant I just hate a lot of people on the internet"	"I am sorry to hearm that. I'm kinda in the same situation with my parents
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be a Redditor because I hate Reddit!‚Äù
‚ÄúNooo!!!1!1!1!1!11!!!! You‚Äôre too young to know because your brain ISNT FULLY DEVELOPED and therefore you have the intelligence of a rock!!!1!1!1!!1!1!!!‚Äù

Fuck people that say this shit.
I turn the tables on people who do this to me. I start every sentence with the word, ""you"", and I don't use any restraint to explain in great detail how wrong they are. They usually ignore it, because these conversations are all about hurting other people. But if you attack back at these people, they wont come back a second time.
Don't worry these people have a IQ of zero 100% Zero
Story of my life.
Reminds me of when I told my supposedly supportive/ally hippie dippy Burning Man friend that I‚Äôm trans (mtf) and she goes ‚Äúmmm I don‚Äôt see you as a woman‚Äù. Well thanks a lot friend, but I promise you will, once I‚Äôm on estrogen!
Yeah honestly this is the thing that eats me up. Anyone can be ignorant or whatever and say dumb things cuz of that... but thinking you know a person better than they know themselves is really way beyond that and like idk how to reconcile my faith in humanity with the fact that enough people have such a lack of empathy that it is seen as somewhat normal. It makes me wonder how much of society and the way we see ourselves as a species is based on simply fooling ourselves into thinking we're not simple animals
I'm sorry people do this, my parents did the same. But mainly because they believed I was ""convincing myself"" that I was trans.
People like telling other people what they should do, even if it's hypocritical. People insist they know people better than they know themselves, even if it's unfounded.
Cisgender men wear dresses and skirts, so I don't see any reason you shouldn't wear them too. I wear skirts sometimes too. Although it's mainly maxi skirts.
The exact same thing happens with sexuality üò≠


EDIT: So I'm gay, but I'm too young to know what I am? Then what about that straight kid over there? Does that mean they don't know what they are either?
One time a very confused Christian man told me ‚Äúmaybe I just don‚Äôt know myself yet‚Äù when I told him I am a satanist. 

I know myself better than that little man will ever know anything, at all, period. 

It‚Äôs projection, they are projecting.

Just happened yesterday in r/teenagers. Someone made a post saying they are tired of getting mad for pointing out the difference between sex and gender definition wise and how they should be used when speaking. I agreed and said I was trans and someone said that my brain is not fully developed yet. And that comparing animals that are trans and gay and lesbian to humans is dumb.
And yet people claim to know their child's gender before it's born

I family respects every trans person except me	"I really don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôve been out since I was 13, literally bagged up and threw away my old clothes, chopped all of my hair off, started T, and socially transitioned to the point where I was completely stealth for 2 years, and my family still treats me like I‚Äôm going through a quirky phase. 

My sister idolizes multiple trans celebrities, will threaten anyone who misgenders her trans coworker, and is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has trans friends she fully supports, but when it comes to me it‚Äôs like I never transitioned. They all ask me for advice on trans things, make sure to never accidentally put my binders in the dryer if my laundry gets mixed with theirs, and consider men who are attracted to me gay, but then they introduce me as ‚Äúthe family lesbian‚Äù and get mad when people ‚Äúassume I‚Äôm a guy‚Äù

Has anyone else had this experience?? I feel like I‚Äôm going insane sometimes."	">I family respects every trans person

No they don't. They perform respect, but they don't actually have respect for those other trans people if that's the way they treat you.
This is... very strange. Have you ever confronted them about it/ask why they do this?
My sister would still aggressively gender me as my agab after I came out to her for years and has never apologized for it. She's big into performatively supporting LGBT people and now that I've socially transitioned she respects my identity but she refuses to apologize for the constant misgendering and gave me a laundry list of excuses when I told her it upset me. Idk family sucks. /:
Wow, I'd normally say that it's them talking the talk but not walking the walk.

But they're mostly walking the walk...?

What the fuck?

My only reasoning is they're irrationally afraid of losing you? Or they're SO good at faking allyism that they don't outright come off as transphobes. You have got to bring it up with them, that's the only way you can grasp what's happening in their heads.

Clearly they see you differently in some way. Why? Well that's what you need to figure out.

If this shit doesn't stop, I'd recommend cutting them off completely. Idk how old you are, but it seems you're either a young adult or nearly one. It's a tough world and economy and all that, so stay safe and stable. But if you can get away from them, that might be the only way.

Maybe it's the vindictiveness in me, but that would definitely show them there er of their ways. Hopefully it doesn't come to that! 

Much love, you deserve better my man. üëâ‚ú®
My family is the same. My sister will starts fights about someone trans from twitter being misgendered but keeps using my deadname and saying ""I don't have to use your name, right? it's just so ugly"". 
My mum also refused to use my name at all until I complained about my dad being transphobic (they are divorced and they compete to be the best). Then she used my name for a while but keeps using my deadname and excusing herself, and saying that she chose my deadname and she does not want to give it up. But she will proudly deffend trans people she meets at work.

Apparently, when we are family, we fall under different rules.
Family and old friends have been the worst in my experience, ditch them all as soon as you can, move somewhere fabulous and start a new life.
This was my grandmother for the LONGEST time!!! My grandma would try so hard to be respectful of other trans people (although she was never great at it but she visibly tried) meanwhile she would get MAD at ME if I very gently asked her to try harder in gendering me correctly.
Infact one time when I corrected her on my name she gave me the most evil smile and cooed out ""Well on your birth certificate~""

Now do I recommend doing what I did in retaliation? Not really; but it's what I did in response to my situation.

I stopped responding.
Dead name being called? Nope. Don't care how loud they scream or bitch or complain.
Call me dead name in public? I'd literally apologize to the person and tell them she was having a dementia episode when I knew she could hear me from a distance.
Buy me female clothes? Act insanely confused and kept putting them in her laundry everytime she snuck them in mine.

It was a l o n g and misrible battle but eventually she began having to respect me. If I don't respond until I hear my name, she has to use my name. If I act like I have no clue who she's referring to when she dead name's me to a stranger, she has to use my proper name to seem sane.

And eventually over time she began to actually see me as male, and although she still says some pretty offensive shit sometimes (for example yesterday she said I still have a 'female laugh' and that has created a huge amount of insecurity in me üôÑ), she doesn't misgender or dead name me unless she is in a super mentally frazzled state (and it's very visibly a mental blep as she'll catch herself instantly and laugh at herself and ask why she said it)

So ... Yeah TLDR; Your family doesn't see you as male. You can either be a complete cock head (like me lol) or be passive and polite (which doesn't seem to be working in your situation.) It depends on how comfortable you are with conflict. Wishing you the best dude
My partners mother is the same, will respect my name and pronouns and some of his other friends but when it comes to him its constant misgendering and deadnaming and i do not understand it
People react very differently when its a spectacle on TV rather than a family member sullying their gene pool. And TV just got past the ""haha man in a dress"" spectacle and started this trend where every trans person is put on a pedestal because they're beautiful and an outspoken and are perfectly prepared to answer invasive questions without being caught off guard, and the unintended consequence is that if you don't fit that image then people feel the need to gatekeep so we don't make ""real"" trans people look bad and the irony is completely lost on them.
My parents and grandma are like this, they oo and ah at trans people in the media but at the same time have only made a handful of attempts to gender me correctly. They literally put up a banner saying 'Birthday Boy' and proceeded to misgender me.
>My only reasoning is they're irrationally afraid of losing you? 

I'd bet it's this. People do grieve for the loss of the brother/sister they *thought* they had and grew up with and it's hard on families to give up what they've known so deeply and closely. It is super easy to respect trans people you only know as trans, but when it's a family member people get weird, like all the hard shit is suddenly in their face.

Super worth talking to them about it IMO. I think they never really latched on to the idea of what happened or something. I feel like the other allyship isn't just performative and that they're just not fully grasping they need to treat a family member the same way, or they love you and it's hard for them to believe they're hurting you when they don't see it or feel it. It's one of those situations where it's like ""OP knows I love them, we're fine"".
I know this isn't an option for everyone, but ever since I could remember I would ask my mom what name she had picked if I had been a girl. She always said there wasn't one because she wanted a boy and wouldn't answer. Then when I came out to her it turned out that she did have another name picked. So my name is still a name my parents had chosen for me. 

That may not have been an option if I had a little sister. And depending on how young someone is, parents may be waiting to pick names until after the ultrasound, but I'm pretty sure parents think about both names before they get pregnant."	sv7v3v	trans	355	0.99	2022-02-18 03:36:23

AITA for accidentally calling my friend by their deadname when they hadn‚Äôt came out to me yet	"Before anyone comments please refer to my friend with he/they pronouns. Please use she/her pronouns for me. my friend has given me permission to use his name in this story so if your talking about my friend please call him August. You can call me op, vel, V or gaymer (which ever one you want I don‚Äôt mind). Also if you have any questions and need more details before you judge just ask me and I‚Äôll try to reply to all of them.




I, (12 F) and my best friend (14M) have been friends for 1 year now, the day he came out as FTM I wasn‚Äôt there because of practice. Yesterday I was talking to August and referred to them by their deadname (autumn). Everyone except August lashed out because I deadnamed my friend, they called me names that I will not repeat and said that I had no right to call myself a member of the LGBTQIA+ community because of my mistake. August pulled me aside to tell me he was trans and he told me their  name and forgave me since I didn‚Äôt know. Everyone expect August is mad at me for deadnaming them and nobody is allowing August to defend me saying that I guilt tripped them into forgiving my actions. I was thinking of just leaving the friend group so I don‚Äôt cause anymore trouble from my mistakes, I don‚Äôt want to break apart close people because of my actions :[

Edit: me and August have been thinking about it and we‚Äôre deciding to drop those people, thank you all for your feedback and it really made me feel better about the situation :] <3 <3

Edit 2: apologies to the people in the comments who are pointing out the holes in my story‚Äôs, I find it hard for me to go into complete detail about a situation if nothing is on the line. (that‚Äôs why irl when I tell a story people think I‚Äôm lying because I never address important parts of the story)"	"Oh, yeah, they need to chill.

More importantly, though: Going from Autumn to August is GENIUS. Just a solid move right there.
Nope, they're over reacting. You didn't know
You are completely innocent in that situation. How could you know he's trans if nobody told you? The group now being mad at you is wrong as you had no possibility of knowing about August.
How dare you not be a mind-reader! /s
nahnahnah, you didn't know & August isn't even mad at you - it honestly sucks that they're speaking **over** the trans person in this situation, he's forgiven you, thats enough, you can't read minds.
You are most definitely not in the wrong here. It might be difficult, but to try not let the words of the others bother you, especially when you know they are wrong. If they continue to treat you this way, I would make new friends. Just know that it wasn't because you made a mistake, but because they were being terrible. 

&#x200B;

And for what it's worth, you seem really lucky to have a friend like August and he must feel pretty lucky to have a friend like you who cares so much about him.
You made an honest mistake and August is cool with it. Y'all are so young that I'm sure this'll blow over before you know it. You good, kid, you are not the jerk here.
It's nice that your friends care about supporting August, but they're a little over zealous. 

You didn't know he had changed his name, so you did nothing wrong. 

Even if you HAD been there for the announcement, it was literally a day ago. People make mistakes. My family still occasionally misgenders me and I've been on T for 5 years. I correct them, we all move on.
You didn't know, not your fault.
You didn't know. There's no way in hell you could've used his real name at the time. You did nothing wrong here.
August is being a decent human while your other ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are absolutely overreacting I would say cut ties with them but don‚Äôt with August cause they seem pretty goated
one time my friend Emmet, (who, when first transitioning, used Ethan) changed his name and never told me, so when I called him Ethan, he flipped out on me. I think he was going through a rough time, but we're still friends. Like besties, and that was like a year ago
those guys are completely overreacting. first of all, you didnt know. second, deadnaming someone once or twice is annoying but not too bad as long as its on accident and someone is able to correct you. getting hostile over that is completely uncalled for. i get that they wanted to defend august but like that was wayy over the top
You didn‚Äôt know so in no way could it even be your fault. They‚Äôre just being childish and incredibly rude. To tell you that you don‚Äôt deserve to be part of the LGBTQ+ community for deadnaming a friend you didn‚Äôt know was out is not only ridiculous but flat out a horrible thing to say and I‚Äôm really sorry they treated you like that.
you didn't know.
You called your friend by their deadname because you didn't know. 
They lashed out on you, for deadnaming him. But how are you supposed to not deadname them when you didn't even know he had a deadname now??

And your so called friends are ""defending"" your friend, and not even letting them speak for himself. 

what the heck.

Neither of you are in the wrong. Except your friends. You can't smell what his new name is, and if they changed their name. Your ""friends"" should let August speak for himself.
if you didnt know you didnt know, you're not a mind reader
If August isn't offended then neither should the others be
no, you aren't. they are overreacting.

funny how it happens so often where everyone is upset at an alleged attacker except the ""victim"", in one of mrbeast's videos they had a guy stay in one room for about 3ish weeks before he left. everyone was mad at mrbeast for the health hazard, except the guy who was in the video.
Don't worry about it, and I the good news is people get less stupid about this kind of thing when they grow up
Your friends are overreacting. Maybe they didn't know that you didn't know possibly??

But EVEN THEN, they are are shitty friends for completely ignoring how August feels and dismissing them when they said it was fine. How were you even supposed to know?? Your friends sound toxic as hell.

NTA, at all.
If AUGUST understands the situation that's all that matters, NTA, this is between you and August, if he has a problem with it it's down to him to tell you the fact he explained he was trans calmly says your friends just want a to fight a battle that Isnt there, you seem to accept your friend, aslong as you don't dead name him intentionally that's all that matters.
Dude needs to chill the fuck out, like if you knew and did it anyway I would fully understand his side but if no one told you how were you supposed to know he was trans.
That wasnt fair for you in that situation for the first week when I came out I had to keep telling different people and friends who didn't originally get told (I had an announcement in my school telling my old form and current form (it's like the people who I'm usually in classes with if you don't know what I'm talking about)) so a lot of people didn't know at first and I told loads of people in that week
Big NTA. Not only did you not know, but importantly it's normal to accidentally deadname at the start, even if you do know. My friends have known me by my deadname for over a decade, it's normal they would revert to habit instinctually. Trans people understand this and accept it takes time for others to break into the new name. The others are being overbearing and are invalidating your trans friend's feelings
Not inly are they over reacting, im worried for how they would treat other honest mistakes. It sounds incredibly toxic and unhealthy at your age to be so outright *militant* and quick to oust others. I hope they all learn some day that humans arent mind readers.
They‚Äôre being dumb imo. You didn‚Äôt know.
Nah you're Gucci mistakes happen and you didn't know so
Your friends are the A-holes in this situation hon
Teenagers really prove the stereotypes true don‚Äôt they. Nah you‚Äôre totally fine, your friends are either chronically online or just over sensitive, people make mistakes anyway and you didn‚Äôt make a mistake because you didn‚Äôt know. Your friends need a dose of reality
The thing about deadnaming or really any disparaging remark is that they're always forgivable (imo) so long as the offender apologizes for what they did and earnestly expresses a will to do better. Everyone makes makes mistakes, but your character is judged on how you react to them. Note that ""I'm sorry you're offended"" or repeated offenses without any apparent effort to improve do not qualify.
They are trying their best to protect their vulnerable friend, but this was a genuine mistake not a malicious attack. The fact that they can't see that is immature of them.

I would talk to your friend and maybe ask if they can talk to your mutual friends about all this.
Not only are those friends in the wrong, but they‚Äôre also not real allies if they‚Äôre speaking over the trans person they‚Äôre ‚Äúdefending‚Äù.
Those people need to chill bruh üíÄüíÄüíÄ

You're fine sis. If August isn't mad at you, it's all fine
Find new friends
that's a really shitty group. ur fine, especially if ur friend talked to you. Really odd for them to freak out and tell you ur not part of the community for a mistake. buy you are also young teens. I promise u ur friend loves u and you don't need to feel bad, embarrassed or anything. have a great day
One of the big rules with this stuff is never make a big deal out of slipping up. Just a simple ‚ÄúAugust‚Äù after the deadname would‚Äôve been acceptable.
Just know that you didn't slip up / make a mistake, It'd be a mistake if you slipped and dead named after you did know A was trans and had a new name, but since you didn't know, the ""friends"" getting mad about it is akin to talking to a complete stranger and getting mad that they don't know your name.

I'm aware that your group is all (hopefully given that two of you are) young teens, but even so, if your other ""friends"" can't / won't listen and understand that you genuinely did nothing wrong. Especially given that A said so, they'd be speaking over the actual trans person... Which is just gross.

You're all still young and people make mistakes, but if your friends don't mature as you both get older, don't be afraid to leave the group.

I've seen older folks who still act like this, create drama from nothing etc, and it's absolutely toxic and not worth dealing with.

Best of luck my dude.
your friends need to chill, its normal not to know if he didnt came out
Kids are incredibly stupid and you should ignore them.
Nta but you shouldn't be using reddit if you're under 13
In whichever possibility you are not wrong, as you didn't know. A better question is, are the friends AH?
It honestly depends on 2 things, how well they know you and whether they know you weren't there when he came out.
If any of the answers are yes, they are AH. If both are no, I wouldn't say they are AH, just protective over someone they care.
You didn't know at the time so you are fine.
That‚Äôs not your fault you literally didn‚Äôt know? Also your friend group need to chill tf out omfg ?!?!
Sounds like an honest mistake. We all accidentally say dumb stuff some time. The real problem here is everyone else speaking over your friend.
You guys are really young, this will blow over but it sounds like they've really overreacted and are being quite unkind which is totally uncalled for. 

I would do your best to remain friends with August because they sound nice, but these other people sound like they're being very petty and deliberately mean. From my experience at school, some kids would often lock onto something like this and use it to shun someone from a friend group. It's not nice and if they continue to be rude to you it might be best to hang out with other people

Before you completely give up on them though, perhaps consider if you can speak to an adult about it, or someone who can act as a mediator. I find that with things like this, having an outside source step in to be a voice of reason can quickly resolve these types of petty disputes.
NTA
If you didn't know, what else were you supposed to do.
Bro you‚Äôre fine.. the person you deadnamed is completely fine with it cause you simply didn‚Äôt know, but everyone is getting pissed for them? 

I‚Äôve made it clear multiple times that if someone deadnames me, it‚Äôs fine if 1: they didn‚Äôt know to begin with. 2: they‚Äôre getting used to it. 3: they‚Äôre talking to me around my family (yay, homophobic and transphobic family)
Unless you're a troll, you're both kids. I'm assuming (and hoping) your friends are kids too, it's natural to overreact a bit.
Yikes your friends all need to chill. You didn't do anything wrong here - it was a genuine mistake.
They should have communicated with you better than they had. The best thing you can do in this situation is apologize. If you had done that to me, I would have laughed and my friend group would have corrected you with smiles on their faces.
NTA for sure. You didn't know and that wasn't your fault. Sounds like you might need new friends, too.
Not only is that a complete overaction but they are speaking for them instead of listening to how it actually effected him. You should definitely try to talk to him about it, but you are no way in the wrong and I'm sure they don't think that.
It's very unreasonable to be mad at someone who doesn't even know and jump to the conclusion that they did know.
NTA you aren‚Äôt a mind reader you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know your friends are slacktivists they don‚Äôt actually care they just want to appear like they do
I just realized that he used a name that I suggested 3 YEARS AGOüíÄ
Back then we would do roleplays and he said ‚ÄúI want to be the boy character!‚Äù (I see an egg cracking)  and I told him the if he‚Äôs gonna be the boy his name would be August, now that‚Äôs his legal name, amazing :]
You know, technically August comes before Autumn so even before any kind of transition it has always been ""August"" just until he was assigned ""Autumn""
OH YEAH I JUST REALISED THAT OMG
FtS (Fall to Summer)
Yeah this sounds like an unhealthy friend group to be in for both August and OP, since they‚Äôre attacking OP and speaking over August and not listening to him when he told them it was alright. Some kids just need to learn to chill
Note the fact that OP didn't even make a mistake. It'd be a mistake if OP slipped and dead named when they did know A was trans and had a new name, but since OP didn't know, the ""friends"" getting mad about it is akin to talking to a complete stranger and getting mad that they don't know your name...
yeah, i agree. even if op did somehow read everyone's mind, mistakes are easy to make, ESPECIALLY since op was friends with august for over a year and had gotten used to the old name.
Now that would be a hell of a superpower. Being able to smell someone's name.
sorry for a stupid question, but didn't you say that you guys have only been friends for 1 year? how did you suggest the name 3 years ago

either way i'm happy for you both. you seem like great friends, and as the rest of the people here said, you're not a mindreader.
A pun and an egg got cracked that day lol you and your buddy are clever
BAHAHA
I've seen this distressing trend recently of allies being SO vehement in their ""support"" that they end up taking away the voice(s) of the trans people they're trying to support. 

Having people that care about me and look out for me is really nice, I'm not trying to say it's not, but if someone accidentally misgenders me and *I'm* not upset about it, then the whole shamey blamey song and dance is 100% not necessary or helpful.
*snif snif* that's a Suzanne for sure
Based on her comment history she's 13, but then its either a mistake on the original post (HOW dough?), this comment is bs, or the entire post is bs.
Sorry that I replied late btw but we weren‚Äôt friends back then
We were I guess ya could say class mates
We didn‚Äôt like each other in any way shape or form until last year, I don‚Äôt consider someone a friend until we have both agreed on it ( its common for me to misread a situation so I never consider a person my friend until they call me their friend so I don‚Äôt make them uncomfortable, it‚Äôs more of a consent thing,  1 year ago August introduced me to the friend group that we are no longer in as his best friend so yeah, and apologies if there‚Äôs holes in my story‚Äôs, my brain automatically discards things that it does not perceive as important info when I sleep because of the way I was raised, if you have anymore questions about August please just reply :] )

En. Nathalie, Suzanne? What's the difference?

but I am in fact 12
oh okay! i understand now. so it's not that you didn't communicate with each other 3 years ago, you just weren't close. thanks for the reply.

i hope things are okay with the rest of the friend group now, by the way. they definitely misunderstood the situation.

and hey, don't be too anxious about these things. i get the impression that you worry way too much over if people dislike you. you sound like a sweet person, so there's really no need
Exactly!!
Please don‚Äôt call me a sweet person, taking the time out of your day to respect someone is the bare minimum, and I don‚Äôt care if people don‚Äôt like me i got used to it 9 years ago
what, when you were 3? lol ok. anyway you're clearly careful not to make your friends uncomfortable and worry a lot over losing them - you worried enough to make a reddit post about it. not everyone is like this. i'm sorry if i said something that made you feel bad, that was not my intention

Maybe this will help someone else	"Story time~
So, last year I came out to my father. I hadn‚Äôt visited him 6 months prior, as I was starting my transition. When I finally found the courage, I went over and told him immediately. He laughed and said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why you haven‚Äôt been coming over?‚Äù He accepted me, or so I thought at the time. 

So, as time went on, two weeks of him joking about it and finally I told him I‚Äôm not his son anymore, and to call me by Gabby or use my female pronouns. In a huff, he almost yelled back, ‚ÄúI made ya and I‚Äôll call ya whatever I damn well please!‚Äù

I had enough. I left and went home. My roommate told me to tell him to f*ck off, and even though I wanted to, I know my dad cared about me and really desired me in his life, as I am his only child. 

So, I went back over the next day, he was joking as he usually was, he‚Äôs quite the comedian, and then started to misgendered me again and get mad when I once again told him to use my correct pronouns and/name. But this time, I said, ‚ÄúDad, look. I‚Äôm gonna be honest. I love you and I want you in my life and I want to be a part of yours. But I don‚Äôt have to. I don‚Äôt have to talk to you or visit. I choose to, and the way you‚Äôre acting about this makes me want to choose otherwise.‚Äù He stopped talking and was quiet for a while. Eventually things returned less awkward, we watched a movie and just hung out as usual. But when I was about to go home, he hugged me and called me Gabby. Without a joke, without sarcasm. And from then on he hasn‚Äôt once misgendered me since. Even after I moved halfway across the country, he texts me and sends me Hello Kitty gifs (I love HK). 

TL:DR
If you have a family member that you know really loves you but they‚Äôre not getting the big deal with your gender identity, let them know your being around them is your choice. And they might lose that privilege.

Edit: wow, this blew up. Thanks everyone for your support, I wish you all the best~ much love."	"Cis people need to hear this too.

Can't tolerate abuse just because it is from family.
That is beautiful. The way you stood up for yourself, and the way he came to respect that. I'm glad you two can move forward together, and be a part of each other's life.

Well, this only works when your parents love you and didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI actually never really wanted you‚Äù to your face =.= (thanks mom, the feeling is mutual)
I'm in a similar situation, i haven't yet reached resolution but I'm working on it, thank you!
It's a complicated situation. Social media tells us to be intolerant with this type of shit - and by all means, we should not tolerate it - but want it or not, they act that way because they feel threatened and scared of losing someone they love, they don't want the situation, the person they care about, to change. My first reaction is to go with empathy first and to acknowledge the way they feel, and then explain how essential this is to you. If they chose to be an asshole and not accept you for who you are even when they know how you feel, then fuck them. But I think it's good to remember that it can be hard for them too, as it is hard for you

Y'all I ended up w half of a tattoo after top surgery (I'm not mad I got it when I was 15 and messy) #1monthpostop		"Legitimately asking, why do they uhh... Cut your nipples off? Any reason? I know this happens when they do this surgery for cancer as well. I'm legit curious.
What did it use to be?
Now come up with a creative tat to run the length of the scar, that would be epic! 
Duuude.... you‚Äôre trim as fuck! What‚Äôs your workout like?
Bro you look great!!
tag this as NSFW please
To resize and reposition them
If they didn't, your nipples would end up at your ankles.

But there are ways to reposition and resize without fully cutting them off. 
An 8 in Roman numerals üòì
I do Pilates and dance 
Y?
My husband is constantly battling with whether or not he wants them reattached or if he just wants to be nipple-less. He hates his nips but is afraid of trading in one reason to not take his shirt off for another.
That's not the worst. This half tattoo is an excuse for a whole new bitchen tattoo
It may be unsettling or a trigger for some people.
He could always get them tattooed on after, depending on where you live there are loads of talented artist who can do some pretty amazing nip tattoos 
I don't understand how a male presenting chest would be unsettling. 
Thank you, yeah it's been discussed. Hasn't really come up lately because he's committed to me getting my orchie before his top surgery (what a gentleman, right?)
It's not his chest itself, but surgery scars in general can be kinda hard to look at. I 100% support OP's surgery but this makes me feel kinda anxious and unsettled.
I'll do it if the mods ask me to; at this point I would like to post my 1 month post op chest as is because no one else w post op scars has to tag their celebration of growth and change as NSFW. Are you uncomfortable with the way my brown body is healing? Does the melanin returning to my skin offend you? This is how brown bodies heal.
This doesn't have anything to do with your skin tone. I'm a dark-skinned person myself (you can check my profile for proof). Do you really have to bring up race in this discussion? I don't like seeing surgery scars, that's it. It doesn't matter if the person's black or white, I just feel uncomfortable seeing that kind of stuff. 
Lmao way to whip out the race card. Im with the other guy saying this should be nsfw. If you have to ask if it's nsfw, it probably is.

Hey, just gonna put a friend on for a tick cause I like their take

While I am sympathetic to scars and medical issues making you feel uncomfortable, as someone with full blown PTSD myself, (among many health issues) there is a point you just have to disengage from a topic that makes you feel uncomfortable. Op has not done anything out of the ordinary in showing their post op scars. It's not nsfw, and it's not something that needs to be censored. If you are interacting with a subreddits about Trans people you will see afab content, and you are going to see surgery scars. Just like if you're interacting with a subject about disabilities you are going to see surgery scars and hear about medical issues, that may be uncomfortable and confronting to you. Choosing to interact with the topic means choosing to interact with the images related to them. As I said before, I have PTSD from severe childhood physical abuse, and there are some topics that arent traumatic that still trigger my PTSD. Like loud noises. At some point I have to choose to disengage from things that cause loud noises, I would not go see fireworks but nor would I begrudge people for having fireworks to go off, I wouldnt ask them to stop because it's a part of life. OP is fully within their rights to have uncensored post op healing pics in a subreddit about trans issues and people. Cheers - Steph

Why aren't the white bodies on this sub receiving the same level of censorship? I would rather look like a fool then someone who isn't aware of how people are responding to the bodies around me. Race or not I have yet to see any other bodies on the sub (majority white) who are receiving a request to have their post marked as NSFW so unless you are the op of this comment I feel like you look like the fool for assuming race isn't apart of this. 
Chill, and i agree some people get very nauseous at the site of surgery marks. Just mark nsfw next time, nobody is getting mad at you

Have you ever been so dysphoric that the sound of your own breathing is filling you with rage?	That‚Äôs the situation, yep. Did homework for almost a full eight hours, got next to nowhere, got really frustrated, stopped, tried to go to bed because I was tired, insomnia ensues, start to think about how disgusting I find my own body, got mad, kept ruminating, started getting angry about the sound of my own breathing, and now I‚Äôm just sitting here stewing in sadness and rage and god damn why the hell do I even try.	"Sorry that you're going through such a hard time. Hang in there ü´Ç
Update: now I just want to cry and throw up LMAO
Just remember that when we say it gets better, not everything is solved, but rather you won't feel this way, and you'll see why you're still amazing, even when down.

Doesn't mean this isn't tough.

Anyways, cheer up fan, we're here!
Did you get any sleep? Do you feel better? Yes not being able to sleep because BRAIN WON'T SHUT UP is annoying af. But yeah I can relate to feeling so dysphoric that pretty much anything will make it worse
This sometimes. , I'm not going to say that sometimes even just the sound of my thinking doesn't bother me a bit.  If I was having a hard time getting to sleep I feel like my breathing sound definitely wouldn't help especially if it was quiet. 

I feel like having someone else like a person or pet being nearby can help me with this sometimes,  though. Too bad pets are expensive and partners don't always help you. üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüêàü¶ôüêï
Omg yes that's where I'm sitting right now
Depression and trying to dissociate through doing homework and keep being focused in anything but your feelings is not okay. 

I can imagine how you feel, aknowledging your own body and hating it all. With time, effort, and good working on your mental and physical health, it will get really better. The present sucks but future will be slowly built towards your own desires, as it belongs to you. 
Take care of your physical and mental health in this painful present, please, you will be able to rock future that way!
Punching walls work good on me.. maybe tou can try

No seriously don't hurt yourself too bad and remember that you you'r beautiful.. and don't you dare say the opposite
Not specifically, but I have felt so dysphoric all I can do is curl in a ball on the floor and try to will my heart to stop. Dysphoria is a bitch
Yes, especially when I‚Äôm trying to catch my breath or when I‚Äôm crying. I thought it was just me‚Ä¶ I hope you‚Äôre doing better though, things do get better, I promise
TBH sounds mot like a hormone thing to me. If you are on HRT already maybe you are gettin into the mood swing stuff?
I‚Äôm tryin‚Äô thank you
Take this hug of mine, it'll pass
No you‚Äôre not alone at all lol.
Not on hormones yet lol
Thank you <3
Well I only know this feeling of me just being angry for any reason, when I forget to take my estrogen in the morning.
Feel better? ü§ó
I be getting the mood swings constantly üòû. Better than feeling nothing at all though
Somewhat, I only got like two hours of sleep so my brain is still destroyed but now everything is just nonsensical so at least it‚Äôs not self-hating speech repeated over and over.
True that. Thats how it felt for me in the beginning, now I'm years in and my perspectiv has changed so much, that I need to be reminded of how it feels, to remember how I started my journey.
Then more hugs for you! :3 ü§ó

Why do cis people say things like what would happen if men could get pregnant?	Like do they forget trans men exist. I‚Äôm not mad or anything just genuinely curious. I actually find it quite funny sometimes as a trans guy	"They don't forget trans people exist, they never think about trans folks in the first place (unless it's for outrage, usually).
I think, for the most part, yes.  All trans people are on the fringe.  We are routinely forgotten about and dismissed.  

However, there are more visible transfolx now than there have ever been.  There‚Äôs strength in numbers.  You are seen.  We are seen.  And we‚Äôre not going anywhere ;)
I think it depends on the person and context. Someone could be saying it totally innocently, forgetting trans men exist. And others just don't believe trans men exist or deny that trans men are men.
Yes, they forget about trans people. I‚Äôve also only seen it brought up when they are pointing out inequality in womens healthcare like saying ‚Äúabortions would be far more widely available if men could get pregnant‚Äù
a transmasc friend of mine uses this phrase

he just means cis men
I myself am a trans man and I know I have these thoughts too. It‚Äôs internalized cis-normativity. At least for me.

But the main thought being that, if afab bodies were not so horrendously overlooked and undervalued in medicine in GENERAL, then healthcare already could be so much better. I mean, to get a uterine biopsy for cancer, the procedure is labeled as ‚Äúpractically painless‚Äù and only needing OTC meds. I would have genuinely rather been under anesthesia for that procedure!!! So much pain!!! (And I‚Äôm cancer free thank goodness) But even sedation isn‚Äôt an option in most places, so afab patients just go through utter torture any time their cervix has to be opened.

But if amab bodies could also get pregnant and experience such symptoms, those symptoms would be taken seriously and would be researched and treated by now. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so endlessly frustrating to me.
Me: What would happen if men could get pregnant? Meanwhile, somewhere: *a trans man is pregnant
Me: The profecy is complete
Tbh I wouldnt be suprised if they didnt even know we existed
i also hear ‚Äûmen and women‚Äú all the time, which i am not
They also don't understand why things are the way they are. If cis men could get pregnant that doesn't mean reproductive control wouldn't exist, things would just be organized around reproduction differently to start with.
A lot of cis people do in fact forget trans men exist, and/or they just dont consider trans men to be men at all. Or the ""pregnant man"" is some anomaly that gets sensationalized press for being ""brave"" or ""weird"" depending on the tabloid. 

Its a bit of a weird way for them to express frustration with misogynistic and patriarchal policy, i get where the logic comes from but they dont think to check themselves on the transphobia.
""But but but muh fumily values!!!"" Is usually what goes through their brains

I don‚Äôt fully understand it. Pretty sure a huge chunk of the hate comes from ignorance and fear
It's more like ""oh yes trans men are men but not *men* men""
I see it as meaning cis men, who are usually the ones making the laws and passing bills related to these issues that they have no idea about. It doesn't annoy me, simply because trans people are such a small percentage of the population that I wouldn't expect trans issues to be included in regular non-LGBTQ+ day to day conversation.
I loooooove bringing that up to my mom. Shes a feminist and loves to say shit like ‚Äúif MEN had to take birth control‚Äù ‚Äúif MEN had periods‚Äù and im like hi mom. You mean cis men. Like yeah fight that patriarchy but um. I get periods too unfortunately
They mean AMAB 
They do it out of hate. 

But a girl can dream right?
When people say that its usually feminists talking about how cis men dont have empathy for people who need afab reproductive care. 
They say if (cis)men had periods that tampons and pads would be free, that if (cis)men could get pregnant that abortion would be a protected legal right. 
The point of this argument is to show light on how cis men in positions of power dont care about afab struggles because it doesn't effect them and only wish to hold power over us. 
So trans men who are not seen as actual men to these cis men in positions of abusive power (and since we also need afab reproductive care) are not really relevant to that part of the conversation. 
Yes we are men who get periods and can get pregnant but we are not the men who have the power to help. 
So in conclusion i wish people who made this argument would specify cis men but unfortunately thats not always going to be the case and ultimately i dont think it matters as much as the point theyre trying to make.
I think they mean cis men aka those trying to control women's bodies (but yeah they also forget trans men exist when saying that)
It's an interesting thought. Essentially, I think we need to remember that when we become trans, it opens us up to a whole new world of things we haven't seen or noticed before.

We become more cynical in a way, being able to experience and see persecution in a way that we may not have before. I was waving a trans flag on a street corner and some white college dude asked me what flag it was. It honestly shocked be a bit. You see, it's common knowledge to me, and so is a ton of other stuff that the average person never thinks about. But, it isn't common knowledge to the average person, and I think we can forget that sometimes.

The average person can barely differentiate between sex & gender, let alone which titles indicate MtF/FtM. They just don't think about us, usually out of ignorance and not maliciousness.
cis people tend to forget about trans people unless they have a friend/know someone in their daily life that is trans. it‚Äôs just the way it is, because society has made being cis the norm while being trans is an ‚Äúoutlier.‚Äù

but, the whole ‚Äúwhat if men could get pregnant‚Äù i assume is a jab at the patriarchy from a feminist standpoint. they‚Äôre asking what if cis men, who have always benefited from society, were to get pregnant. it would be an entirely different process because they would actually be heard. it‚Äôs the same for menstruation, what if cis men had periods? the pain and ways to manage it would be free or covered by insurance, and views on it would be entirely different.

trans men do get pregnant and have periods, but we grew up AFAB so we know what it‚Äôs like to live in a society that we don‚Äôt really benefit from. i know a lot of trans men that transition and admit that it‚Äôs weird being a man and now having that man privilege. we are trans though, so despite being men, cis people won‚Äôt acknowledge our opinions as much.

although this is the reality, i hope and do have hope that it‚Äôll eventually change.
They probably don't think that far and ask more the question. How would it be to give birth without an uterus or where would be the child come from.

My hope would be that the childs are born like Athena
I think usually they mean ""what if rich cis/het white guys could get pregnant, would we really be fighting abortion then?""
Fr. Just tell them to read some omegaverse or smthn then they'll get itüòéüëç
It a statement that cis men are utterly clueless and unhelpful to women in general.  They care more about unborn babies then the lives of people with the fetus.  

Trans men aren‚Äôt included because they are not part of the power structure with cis men typically.  It meant to be a focus and railing against societal sexism.
ü´Éüèª
[deleted]
I think alot of them just dont see trans men as men
I'm from a very conservative state. I hear the hate all the time. They do not believe someone's gender differs from birth sex no matter what. To them someone who is FtM is a woman with psychological issues and nothing more. They are either to dumb or to bigoted to think differently.

Edit: undid typo
[removed]
Okay but science
Who knows what passes for thought in the cisoid mind? Maybe it's just some kind of random verbal spasm caused by a lack of hormones in the diet. I would suggest someone study it but I don't think we need to waste any science on cises when there are real problems in the world like a lack of cat ear surgery.
I mean hyenas and seahorse would be prime examples. Hyenas would be more accurate for a cisman though and a very scary thought.
Generally speaking it seems to be ‚ÄúIf a cis person says it, they‚Äôve forgotten trans folk even exist, if a trans person says it, they‚Äôre talking about the men who forget trans folk exist‚Äù
They either don't believe trans men are men or they legitimately do not think about queer people enough to remember that we exist. It's so strange.

Same thing as when you see a gay couple and a straight person jumps to every conclusion about their relationship except for that they're together.
I see it as ‚Äúwhat if *cis* men could get pregnant?‚Äù Makes the question make more sense.
In the Netherlands there is a documentary called ‚Äúryan is zwanger‚Äù i bet it has english subs! And ryan gets tested for pregnancy diabetes and the insurance says; we can not pay you because it is for females only. Whilst ryan def got tested and underwent the appointment it is very odd that the insurance would say such a thibn. Typical situation with ‚Äúcomputer says no‚Äù 

When its about periods and pregnancies i always correct my friends with *people with periods. I think if we all do such things it becomes easier and easier for the gen pop to understand that men can get pregnant or have periods. 

But. Yeah. It does suck OP. it does. 

Ps; i do live in the Netherlands where (before they recently changed it) you were acuired by law to transition everything. You vould not choose what kijd of thinngs you wanted. AND being unable to produce offspring (neutering?) was one of the things recuired by law that you had to do. It sucked. Im glad those rulings are a bit more soft now
They don't ""forget"" trans men exist, it's just not part of their default thought process. It's pretty obvious that they are talking about AMAB people when just saying ""men"" in that context. No point in interpreting more into it imo.
...I wrote a story on r/nosleep from the perspective of a trans man, and of the scary shit going on around his trip to a Planned Parenthood clinic to get an abortion to save his life. I can't answer your question.
Folx?
And that is a prime example of the toxic cisnormativity that cishet people spout on a constant basis.


Side note tho, I remember seeing this artistic photo of a trans man who was pregnant was being embraced by his husband and it was the most soulfully invigorating thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
Honestly true. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised either
Ugh, I hate that ur right
Exactly. Yeah I think they mean cis men too
My family always generalise men around me. Gets annoying, as if I‚Äôm not a part of it.
That makes sense. In the context I heard it in it sounds more like they were challenging the patriarchy
That still gets really messy when it comes to intersex people though‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbiological men‚Äù or even ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù is really such a vague term trying to describe an extremely complex thing that‚Äôs not really binary.
‚ÄúBiological men‚Äù is not a thing. I think you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúcis men‚Äù.
I think most of them just forget about trans men sadly.
>|to them someone who is FtM is a man with psychological issues and nothing more <| 

I‚Äôm confused. This can be taken a few ways 

As a typo and you meant MtF if so it would make sense 

Or I could say this 

Someone who is FtM is a man so I don‚Äôt get their argument and someone who is FtM with dysphoria is a man with psychological issues called‚Ä¶well dysphoria.
Trans men can (and do) get pregnant.
Probably a typo
Folx is an inclusive exchange for ‚Äòfolks‚Äô
That‚Äôs missing the point a bit, I think. When someone says abortions would be more accepted if men could be pregnant, what they‚Äôre saying in context is, ‚Äúif these men that are arguing that abortion should be illegal were able to get pregnant, they wouldn‚Äôt be saying it‚Äù. Which I think is a fair point, because I‚Äôve rarely seen a trans man who is anti-abortion. It could be phrased better, sure, but with context it makes sense.
I brought it up because it‚Äôs the example I see the all the time. When cis people say that they‚Äôre not thinking about trans people (let‚Äôs be fair they never are) and instead they‚Äôre making a point that if these cis men who are making harmful legislation could get pregnant then abortions and plan B would as widely available as Starbucks. Which, even tho it leaves out trans men, is true. If those cis men were the ones that could get pregnant I hardly think they‚Äôd be as opposed to abortions and let‚Äôs be honest we know that to be a fact already because we know they pay for their mistresses to get abortions
Most feminists do, at least when they're talking about the shit women deal with because of cis men and the patriarchy. People are just lazy and forgetful, especially with what is still a fringe minority to many people.
[deleted]
Sorry yes üòÇ it's so obvious in my head that they are a man that I typed it wrong. Their mindset is that someone who is FtM is and always will be a woman. 

To them anyone who believes that they aren't the gender they were assigned at birth is simply mentally ill and needs to be medicated or sent to a psychiatric hospital. It sounds extreme but I have literally heard this argument from multiple people.
Don't feed the troll, they're not here to do anything except spread hate.
Is folks not already as inclusive as it gets?
> It could be phrased better, sure

I'm tired of people using incorrect scientific terms and statements to justify their transphobia	"In the country where I live, there is a popular 'science' page that often uses outdated and tranphobic, fatphobic, sexist terms. 
Today, they posted about transphobia.
First words in the post are ""this is transphobia"" on the left side, and ""this is not transphobia"" on the right. 
On the left, obvious transphobic things like ""laughing at trans people"" ""denying trans people their right to transition"". 
But then on the right:
1. Saying there are only two genders
2. Saying that a difference between your gender and gender identity is an illness
3. Saying gender is only determined by genes and not culture (that was supposed to mean 'mental gender is not a valid gender')




There were so many likes to that post and so many commenters who agreed and praised the author of the page.
I am so tired of people pretending they are experts in the transgender field, even though they have no education in it. I am tired of people claiming ""this is basic biology"". I am tired that people use outdated terms that are INCORRECT SCIENTIFICALLY to justify their obvious transphobia - to deny the fact that we are who we are. 
When will this end, when will people let us fucking live without us having to have endless disputes about our right to exist? When will discussion about the validity of our identity end? And lastly, why do people care so much about what junk we were born with and not about what we are?
I had to vent cause I'm just so mad."	"""Air resistance doesn't exist. It's basic physics.""
My bestman is a biologist, and we often talk about trans people on sports, and he confirm some of the divergences between bodies, but everytime he says, ""anyway, banning transpeople of their gender gategorie is transphoby and we should find another solution that don't shame trans people"". He is a really good friend and ally
We must fight to end the genetal mutilation of intersex infants. If we protect intersex babies we are protecting all of us from the dangers of misinformation.
Anyone claiming that science supports the idea of binary gender is *decades* out of date. Fields like anthropology and sociology have recognized the fact that gender is socially constructed since the 1970s.   


Not that the anti-trans crowd *actually* cares about science.
You just have to learn to not go into these kinds of spaces online and avoid people like this IRL as much as possible.

The only way to win the game is not to play, even if that means fighting the urge to argue with these people :/
Just because you don't 100 % agree with everything regarding a topic doesn't mean you are phobic. A phobia is an extreme reaction to something. Saying there are only 2 genders is not phobia.
I've seen it woth racists and homophobes, where they pat themselves on the back for not burning people at the stake. 

Its just to make themselves feel better, pretend they're good people and not total cunts, sry u have to go thru this shit, ppl suck üòï
Even with so called allies using outdated terms, I've had many ""disagreements"" with my friends on terminology but they keep digging their heels in
What is the name of this ""science"" journal
In my opinion this people should be easy to convince i myself thought there were only 2 genders but i quickly realised why it was wrong, if this people are logical they should be just as easily swayed
People will use anything to justify their transphobia. Whether its science (which has proven that genders arent binary but are cultural human inventions) , god (who love everyone, exept apparently the lgbtq community for some reason) or the elderly (which this subreddit has shown are completly capable of understanding and respecting us). Stop blaming your transphobia on everything and just admit your discriminating for no reason other than lack of understanting. Or better yet, try to understand and accept trans people.
""Ay listen, idc what you think you've learned. My physics professor in 9th grade says air resistance doesn't exist so obviously you're just making shit up to fulfill your own bias!""
yeah the transphobes are like ""it's basic biology"" and I'm like I'm sorry but have you ever heard of advanced biology?
This is my new retort.
yo this is actually the *best* analogy for that, thank you
Yes, this is true! But I don‚Äôt see the relation to the original post. Maybe I‚Äôm just confused?
I didn't *go* to those spaces. This was shared all over the trans groups in my country, which is quite understandable considering how the page is one of the biggest 'science' pages on facebook, so people were disappointed. Even when you avoid tranphobia it always finds a way to get to you.
I agree
saying there are only two genders invalidates the identity of non binary people and therefore it is transphobia. idk if you're new to lgbt related topics or what but any lgbt related ""phobias"" are not in fact ""phobias"" as in extreme fears of something (like social phobia), but reactions that invalidate, humiliate, or just reject scientific knowledge (such as claiming there are only two genders in a world with non binary people, whose identity is valid; claiming homosexuality or being trans is a sickness, which is just... not true? and leads to stigmatising us)
Can confirm all cows in my vicinity are frictionless spheres in complete vacuums.
""if air has resistance, how can we move through it? Sounds like you're deluding yourself.""
unfortunately, they genuinely have not in many cases. 

A lot of transphobes are sold on the idea that there *isn't* more advanced knowledge and research and understanding to be had on the subject, because as far as they're concerned, *they're already there.* 

They already have the ""correct"" understanding. Obviously, that's not true, but it does give context to why many transphobes are so frustratingly dense about things.
I can see some kind of connection there if I think laterally:

1. Stopping genital surgery on intersex babies may lead to more adults with non-binary genitalia, therefore
2. More adults will have come in contact with and have exposure to non-binary genitalia, therefore
3. More adults will be normalised and open to all kinds of genitalia on people of all genders, therefore
4. Less transphobia

It's a stretch though, a long game, and there are many more effective ways of combating misinformation and transphobia (despite the fact that genital surgeries on intersex babies should definitely be stopped regardless).
It‚Äôs inseparable from misinformation about trans people, it‚Äôs really also inseparable from misinformation about the vaccine. All of the misinformation is bad and hurts people. I think saving babies from mutilation is a really good starting point.
Transphobic content finding its way into trans spaces is probably something I should have considered before smashing a comment together
Thank you. I find this community to be totally resistant any form of discussion regarding non-trans peoples view of things. The world does not only exist from a trans point of view. As the other person who commented on my comment pointed out, words no longer need to mean what they intended to mean -like phobia- this word now encompasses anyone or anything that doesn't wholeheartedly agree with every opinion coming out of this community.
I know, also the fact that those are the kind of people that are basically *commited* to misunderstanding you. 

I don't know why, but for some people admitting to a mistake is a big problem, like they would lose their honor if they changed their mind when they were very deeply convinced they are right. 

That, and the fact that lgbt-related issues are considered leftist-political, like environmental topics, and often trigger far-right people and make them agressive, makes discussion quite often pointless.
Agreed. I can get there, but it‚Äôs a stretch! Worth it on its own merits but not as a method to protect trans folks from transphobia.
Okay, still confused. Look, you‚Äôre just giving me arguments about why what you said is true. And I‚Äôm not denying that it‚Äôs important. I‚Äôm just questioning why you posted it as a reply here.

Also your comment on vaccine misinformation makes me even more confused!
With certain beliefs and certain people, you cannot convince them you are right. They‚Äôll never listen. Their worldview is so deeply entrenched that to challenge it is equivalent to attacking everything they are. Once that happens, the only thing you‚Äôre doing is making them hate you more and more until eventually something snaps. That thing is never their worldview, its their temper, and now you have a belligerent angry person who thinks they are backed into a corner and is now defending their perception of the world with either their fists or, worse, a weapon, against something they see as a direct threat that needs to be eliminated.

[FTM] how do I explain to her?	"So, for almost 4 year I have identified myself has a trans boy, my family and friends are aware of that and they're pretty cool with it.
The thing is, my mom today called me by my dead name, and I feel so bad when she did it that I started to cry a little. She ask ""what happened? Why are you crying?"" I said to her that I don't like when she calls me by that name, and my mom said pretty mad ""i do it bc you are not paying attention to me, and I know that's annoying you"" 
I deserve to be treated like that just bc i wasn't listening? Maybe I do, but still hurts because it's very important to me the support and acceptation from my mom, and when she calls me by my dead name makes me feel insecure and kinda dysphoric.

What should I do? What do I tell her to make her understand how I feel? How do I explain to her why is so important to respect my new name? 

Thanks for reading I really appreciate your advice<3

„Åè‚Å†„Ç≥‚Å†:‚Å†ÂΩ°

[Edit]
So, i talk to my mom today, it was eh ok, i explained to her properly why it makes me feel bad and she said that she's going to avoid saying it [but I have to be more productive and pay more attention to my environment], uh yeah, thanks to all your comments, it really helped me a lot, all of you are a really nice person<3"	"deadnaming as a 'punishment' implies that your identity isn't a inherent part of you, but something that you only get to keep if you're nice, that's extremely fucked up to do that
When she uses the wrong name, ignore her intently.
U dont deserve that dont ever think that she has to understand that u keep ur head up ok if she cant or wont try best u can do is be well.mannered n move on or put her on blast n play her game just remember u deserve respect either way
OP, on a less sarcastic note. My mom deadnamed me because she was telling a story from the past. I shuddered and immediately shut down, and she hasn‚Äôt done it since after apologizing profusely. 

Maybe even show her these comments about how this isn‚Äôt appropriate. Hurting your child to make them behave differently is abuse. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è
The easiest way to explain it, as much as it sucks, is to do it back. 

Don‚Äôt call her mom, call her by her name. Or use her maiden name if she has one. Or a childhood nickname. 

Sometimes the only way, and the easiest way, to get someone to understand how you feel is to make them feel that way
If you have a good relationship with her, try talking and telling how you feel when she deadnames you. If it doesn't work just ignore her when she does it until she gets your name right lol

You don't deserve being treated like that even if you're being punished, she has to understand that
Maybe she thinks you're not listening because you're not used enough to your ""new"" name and thinks she needs to use the one you're used to to make you react.

Ask her if it's really worth having you react by making you cry or fell miserably hurt everytime or if she could use your real name in a louder voice or touching you to get you to react.
By doing this, your mother implies that your identity is a privilege and not a right. That is horse shit. And of anyone, I would know about horse shit.
if she calls u names to get your attention, why not do the same? 

whenever my mom complain about me giving them the taste of their own medicine, I tell them 'thanks my mom taught me well'

sometimes it's the only way really
This honestly boils down to a perception problem, ask her if she thinks it‚Äôs a privilege that you have earned for her to call you by your preferred name and pro-nouns, or if she feels like that‚Äôs your right? Being trans and if she accepts your feelings and thoughts or if she is simply humoring you in your silly phase? Because the only reason some one would give the reason she gave you for deadnaming you, (‚ÄúI do it bc you are not paying attention to me, and I know that‚Äôs annoying you‚Äù) would in my opinion be that she is treating her acceptance of your trans identity, as something that can be given or taken away based on your behavior. If your good she respects you, but if your not, she doesn‚Äôt have to. That her respect of your trans identity is conditional on your behavior, rather then an intrinsic right to be respected.
So I think you and your mom are due for a pretty deep convo in the future.
That‚Äôs not right. Tell your mom how you feel. Do you have a legit reason for not hearing her? Or were you ignoring her, if you were ignoring her that‚Äôs not very nice of you either.
You need to let her know that it doesn't ""annoys"" you, it hurts you, that's not the same at all, tell her that hurting your feeling is not the solution, it won't make you want to listen to her, in fairness it'll be even worse, here you were just not paying attention, I guess it was not on purpose, it happens to all of us, you don't insult someone who is not paying attention you just tap on their shoulder or something.
I hope my comment was helpful and I'm so sorry that your mom is doing such a thing, I hope it'll get better.
If she wants to grab your attention, she can just use your full (correct) name like every other mother in the world does, ie ""First_Name x*Middle_Name Surname."" Or she can just call your name a couple of times. I'd say deadnaming is equivalent to beeting your child.
That‚Äôs terrible and I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm not trans and I don‚Äôt think most people who aren‚Äôt fully grasp the extent to which it hurts to be called a deadname. I have read about it a number of times and I certainly can cognitively comprehend and respect it but I have no equivalent experience and your mom doesn‚Äôt either. I would try sitting her down sometime when you‚Äôre both calm and explaining to her just how awful and dehumanizing it feels to you. You may need to directly say that you would prefer to be slapped or kicked or some other sort of equivalent horrible experience for her to understand just how deeply this is registering for you. I hate that for you and I‚Äôm sorry that you have to explain it. You shouldn‚Äôt have to bear the burden for getting other people to treat you humanely on top of dysphoria and any other challenges you already face. But it is what it is now and I hope that talking to her helps it get better.
One-up her and just just hang up. ""Every time you're dead name me, you're going to hear dead air on the other end of the phone"".
Hi there! Someone else [posted a rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/xn5dy4/rant_misgendering_trans_criminals_unlikable_trans/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that reminds me of this vibe. Hang in there.
Would it be unsafe for you to tell her that you will act as all other people do and answer exclusively to your chosen name? You consider being called by other names to be disrespectful? You will walk away from any conversation in which she antagonizes, manipulates, or insults you‚Äîbecause that is not how family members should treat each other.  

Those are your boundaries.  If she won‚Äôt be respectful, you will have to adjust your side of the relationship to match. If she cannot do better,  you may need outside support to assist you, but hope that‚Äôs not necessary. 

You need ways to shut down your mother‚Äôs abuses.  These are some ideas.  The model is simple:  1) interrupt and correct her when she crosses a boundary. 2) include a brief fair rationale for why her conduct is not acceptable; 3) Keep on moving forward.
my mom used to use mine whenever i was doing something she didn‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs not okay, regardless of the situation. Especially over something as simple as not listening
I'm sorry I'm late but I'm glad it's going better now hope it goes the way you want it to
Absolutely this ‚òùüèæ
Sadly this is something that happens alot. It's heart breaking.
This. Right here. If she's calling out a name that's not yours, she's not talking to you. If she persists, ask ""who's \[deadname\]?""
I sometimes call my mom by a nickname and she's 100% okay with it xD I gave her that nickname when I was like 5 and now I'm almost 30.  
(Sometimes I even use a nickname she gave herself when she was a child :DD)  
Yes, she's my biological mother and we get along. I also call her mom sometimes.
It might not affect them though , if I call my mum by her name , she doesn‚Äôt care but it I call my Dad by his then he does( as he sees it as disrespectful). Tbf I‚Äôve just realised that I call my parents by their name when trying to get their attention, but this is obviously different than calling someone by their deadname, especially when it has this reaction
You, my child, dare to make ME repeat myself? Well let‚Äôs see how you feel when I take your HUMAN RIGHTS away. You‚Äôre grounded from humanity now. That‚Äôll show you. 

-a *reasonable* parenting move

"When does ""we're trying, we just keep misgendering and dead naming you by accident"" get ridiculous?"	"Idk, I just feel like it's really starting to get stupid. I've been out as nonbinary to my family for 4 years and they're still only getting it right half of the time on a good day. I completely understand it takes getting used to, because they knew me as cis for 20 years, but 4 years is a long ass time to get used to it. I lived with them for most of that time and I still visit often, so it's not like they've just barely been around me. They're supportive for the most part, they just ""are super duper trying and having a hard time with it"". I dunno. It's honestly really disheartening. I hate to get mad at them, but it's like, at what point do I get to say ""this is goofy, put in a little effort, actually get it right consistently""?"	"I have a nurological issue that affects my memory, and it took me under 3 months to fully swap from she/her to he/him and stop using his deadname.

4 years is a joke, it doesn't take that long at all.
Yeah I'd say it gets ridiculous after the first year tbh, 4 years is atrocious
Stop responding to them when they get it wrong.               ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
They are 100% doing it on purpose after so long. If you want to maintain a relationship with them, a serious conversation needs to be had. If not, severely limit the time you spend with them, or cut them out completely.
If my rather conservative in laws, in their 60s, can figure it out with only occassional slip ups, anyone can.
I cut them out at 3 years.  It‚Äôs been almost 9 years.

It shouldn‚Äôt take more than 6 months.
4 years is a little much. I get sometimes it's hard for people to train their brains to call someone they've known for years by a new name/pronouns, and sometimes accidents happen, but yeah, 4 years says they aren't even bothering to try imo.
nah dude that‚Äôs so dumb from them. it‚Äôs very irritating, my parents are the same. it‚Äôs been almost 4 years now and they still only call me ‚Äúshe‚Äù and still insist that they are trying. it‚Äôs pathetic, parents can‚Äôt say they care about their child and then blatantly disrespect them every single day on purpose. i‚Äôm sorry about your family dude, they suck
Right now. Tell them to put in some effort already! Stop responding to your deadname or incorrect pronouns. 

I always tell people to update my name in their phone and delete the old name but also, close your eyes and imagine an Address Book or cell phone Contacts List or an old Rolodex from the 1970's, and visualize yourself physically updating that record. You're applying white-out to the card with my old name, letting it dry, then reeling that index card into your IBM Selectric typewriter, and pounding out my new name on those heavy mechanical keys, and re-inserting it into the Rolodex.
After my grandfather got it right literally the moment I told him, I stopped considering most people's excuses legit. Sure I expected some slip-ups from people who knew me a long time, but it's always clear who is actually trying and who isn't.
This exact thing happened to me. I use they/them pronouns and my family was fucking up for years. One day I said alright there‚Äôs gonna be a misgender jar, and started sending Venmo requests for $5 every time someone messed up. They very suddenly figured it out. Now I get misgendered like once a family get together instead of 15 times or so.
When it‚Äôs been over a year. Yeah they‚Äôve known you as cis for 20 years, but they see you everyday which gives them more than enough practice. They aren‚Äôt actually trying.
When i came out, it took some of my teachers only about a month or so to get my pronouns right 99% of the time, and that was with about 150 students. Four years is bullshit, they blatantly don't care. If they do, they don't care nearly enough.
after a year they should be used to it. four years is wayyy too long
I‚Äôm currently at a year and a half on hrt and mine doesn‚Äôt try. I‚Äôve been out for 15 years so honestly at this point, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to happen for me. 4 years is a long time, maybe cut them out or don‚Äôt answer until they do. I have tried both of these with no success.
I give 6 months to a year past that it is a deliberate slight
I would say that after 3 or 4 months has gone by it starts to wear thin. Once its been over a year I call bs.
Honestly it depends for me. This post is talking about family but I had a work colleague that for 6 months would refuse to call me he. I later found out that he fully told a friend of mine that I made there that I'm not a man and that he finds this lifestyle ridiculous. Safe to say I left. With family though, mine get it wrong sometimes but always call me my name. 4 years is definitely too long. I've been out for almost 2 years and they started to get it after maybe 7 months to 10 months in. They call me she sometimes rarely before correcting it. But my name they never get wrong. I think it's worth having a chat if you can.
lol babe it gets redundant after like a month especially if you‚Äôre in constant contact with them they need to get a grip
The thing is it isn't hard if they're putting a sincere effort into it and have a healthy and affirming view of gender.  


If it's not due to lack of effort, then it's probably the other reason.
That's ridiculous. Employ the anti dead name tool (an airhorn) and see how long it takes them to change then. I was prepared to give my family a grace period, but they dead named me with such frequency they did a speed run on my good will.
They aren't really trying if they still gets it wrong. I have a friend that had a hard time with my new name, but I just gently corrected each time and he started to get it right. Now he always gets it right.

I would say it gets ridiculous after like 6 months or so. 4 years is ""wtf? do you have a learning disability or something?"". 

Constantly remind them when they mess up. Each and every time. Gently. ""I know you're trying. You can do better"". And when they don't progress you put your foot down harder.
I've been out for over 5 years to my friends and they swapped within the first month of me being out to them
My parents were a little after them but closer to me being a year out to my friends, I haven't had problems after the first 2 months and we recently found and removed a brain tumor from my mom and she's still doesn't misgender me.
After coming out to all of my family none of them have had issue with referring to me by my own name and gender, and those that have I do not speak to anymore.

4 years and they can't get it right is absolutely absurd, and shows they aren't trying
It can literally take years for people to get that you changed your name.

I simply dropped a ""Y"" from my name, and even up to five years later, some of my friends parents still used it.
>.<
My family took a full year to get used to it, and most of my classmates a few months, but four years is a little over the top in my opinion. I mean, it depends on the situation, if you live with them and see them a lot or you don't really see them at all, but all in all, I think a conversation would be in order.
Depending on who it is and how they do it, how they treat you on general, it has seemed pretty apparent when someone is legitimately trying and messing up and when they're not. My grandfather? He's trying, and he's did pretty dang well for a first time only messing up a little after I told him (and he's a bit of a silly, forgetful man). I can tell he's truly trying. My mother in the other hand does NOT want to accept me not love me as her daughter and it shows in her general demeanor and how often she dead names and misgenders me. I can tell she doesn't refer to me properly unless I'm there or someone willing to correct her in my favor.

Frankly, if they care about you they will try harder and you will notice a definite change, and then after a while rarely a slip up. 4 years is a sign of belligerent refusal to try properly nor to care enough about you.
I kinda understand a little bit. Adults learn slower than young ones. Even if its been 4 years, they have been calling you by your dead name and pronouns for much longer, so swapping everything as adults takes a bit longer. Like my manager is in his 60s and i came out to him 3 years ago but he's known me since highschool using my dead name. So for him it was difficult, especially when he is having memory problems cause his age
How long it takes is proportional to how much work you put into it. At this point they're not doing any work, they may think they are because they're not misgendering you all the time.
I‚Äôm kinda lucky in the sense that my trans loved one chose to be called by the nickname I always referencing to them by, growing up. 
No they didn‚Äôt choose it because of me, and it used to drive them crazy growing up, but it‚Äôs always the first thing outta my mouth.


Though I‚Äôm Autistic, and my brain kind of goes File/deadname/current name/correct pronouns. 


So it‚Äôs like the original director is permanently stuck under deadname and can‚Äôt be changed but when I access it it goes to correct name.


If you think of people‚Äôs brains as one giant computer your deadname is still rattling around in the folder üìÇ for their directory of all things that are inherently you. 


Sometimes their recall reads it wrong, or they had a system restore on the file that is you. It‚Äôs like short term memory is stored in the RAM and they‚Äôre mind did a RAM dump n then forgot everything that was important that‚Äôs new. 
It never gets stored on the disc or rewritten and moved to long term.


Either their hard ware (memory recall)
Or
Software (their personality) 
Is faulty. 

Unfortunately fixing human software isn‚Äôt as easy as reinstalling it.

(My aim is to make you laugh, hopefully it works).
bro same. i‚Äôve been out to my family for almost 2 years. it took them no time at all to use my chosen name but they STILL don‚Äôt use the correct pronouns and get mad at me when i correct them. shit sucks
In my experience, when people don't get your pronouns or name correct after a long time, it's usually because they're not doing the work mentally. They're still thinking of you as your deadname and pronouns and just applying a filter of sorts (proper name and pronouns) when spoken aloud, rather than actually replacing the old version in their minds.

If they're supportive enough, maybe have a conversation with them about how they think of you and ask them to mentally correct it rather than just verbally apply a filter.
I had a really similar situation with my family (they were all extremely supportive but a lot of misgendering and ""we're really trying"" and me getting really frustrated and being like ""I've been my current name and pronouns for literally 5 years and I have a beard""). I don't think there was anything malicious about it but I did have a conversation with them. Here's the gist of the conversation:

""I know you're having a hard time because you knew me as this for so incredibly long. I appreciate your effort but these mistakes come off in two ways to me.

1: You don't respect me enough to use my name and pronouns.

2: You use my old name and pronouns when referencing me or talking about me when I'm not around.

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it's not 1. If it's 2 we need to come up with solutions. The first would be update my contact info and photo in your phones to make it a little easier there. The other would be to practice and correct each other or yourself when referencing me or talking about me.""

Luckily this conversation went well for most people involved and definitely resulted in a lot of light bulb moments. I think the real kicker and point of realization was the ""I know you're talking about me with old name and pronouns when I'm not there."" 

Another kicker was me jokingly saying ""I wonder how dumb the waiter thinks you are"" after a family member misgendered me at a restaurant (I pass really well). I don't recommend that method though.
My family got better after a few months, 4 years is insane. I was deadname for 22 years, and many changed instantly, others few weeks or months, years is purposeful I‚Äôm sorry.
I set my parents with the expectation that if they misgender me they need to go backs bud correct themself EVERY time. It helped that my sister was super supportive and would correct every single time they messed up. If you have someone who can do this that would be great! Also if your parents practice when you‚Äôre not there with each other, they can have a conversation with each other about simple things about you and practice using your pronouns and name. If they aren‚Äôt willing to do this then that‚Äôs BS. Its some work upfront but once you get the hang of it it becomes so easy. My dad would say for the longest time that it‚Äôs just so hard for his old brain and then once my mom started being able to do it I think he realized he was just being lazy.
Mm. One of the many great questions of time üòÜ
My family has a shitty memory as a whole, myself included. Just hard to make things stick, and hard to override ingrained knowledge. And of course, they've known me for the 26 years I've been alive.

Literally everyone has switched to calling me Kara and she/her within the six months I've been out. Ymmv but 4 years seems like a fucking cop-out excuse at this point.
I just want to say when I first started passing my mother started accusing me of being a traitor and ending up exactly like my father who I am not at all as fucked up as (he‚Äôs in his 60s and still passes out drinking and falls through his third floor window in the middle of the night and just sleeps there on the lawn) I don‚Äôt know if you really need family to accept your gender identity so much as you need to make sure you achieve your own life goals and make it out of the house safely so that you can live the life you deserve
A strategy I used for someone who was chronically misgendering me was to ask for them to donate $1 to The Trevor Project each time they did so. Helped a lot honestly! Similar low-stakes arrangements can be pretty effective, especially if there‚Äôs minor public shame involved tbh
My Japanese teacher took 3 days and she barely speaks English
Its not a habit for them because they don‚Äôt want it to become a habit for them. They don‚Äôt respect you, and for that I am sorry. You deserve better.
Grab an air horn. Or a spray bottle. Or both.
I'm 30, and my family took about a month to get it right. My 93-year-old grandpa who was bombed by the Japanese Empire in 1941 is the only person in my family I haven't come out to (obvious reasons I think we all understand), and my mom's biggest issue is forgetting that she's SUPPOSED to deadname me with him.
...your family sounds like they're being a$$holes. I'm so sorry. BUT WE LOVE YOU!!!!!
I agree with those saying this indicates not practicing in your absence. I know when mine do this that‚Äôs exactly what is happening. It took my brother forever to get they/them but once I‚Äôve added he/him to the mix he‚Äôs been fine, but I think this is because they/them is still so ‚Äúnew‚Äù to people they will often refuse to learn it and do better with binary changes. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that my dad doesn‚Äôt get my name right but still uses the entirely wrong pronouns. 

Really it‚Äôs personal preference of how long YOU are willing to put up with it and how much you value those relationships. You either set a hard boundary and risk ending those connections or you continue to softly push back and deal with it as a means of keeping the peace. I say when it‚Äôs ridiculous is when YOU are fed up. But you do deserve more accuracy after 4 years.
what this means is they are using the deadname and old pronouns behind closed doors, and only trying to remember to be polite directly.
Depending on who is doing it. I might not recommend this.

I got punished by my school for refusing to acknowledge an instructor that refused to learn my pronouns.

Although both the school and instructor kinda Garbo so whatever
That‚Äôs such an arbitrary number
I thought I was being very patience, at 3, and now 6, months. Mine aren't even trying. ""You'll always be <deadname>"" I skipped dinner with them.
Tbh I just might do that.
The weird thing is that they're really very loving parents and I'm very close to them, I know they care a lot about my wellbeing. I think the problem is that they still fundamentally think of me as a woman and are trying to kindly humor my gender identity. I've had to misgender a trans friend to people she wasn't (and did not want to be) out to at the time and it took sustained mental effort to do, because to my mind, she was firmly filed as a woman. If that's what they're having to do, I understand that that's hard. I guess I just wish they could actually perceive me differently.
I think that's exactly the problem, yeah.
yep exactly. they're fucking it up still because it isn't a habit for them, it's something they're making an effort to do to your face. if they used the right name and pronouns when you're not around, and corrected themselves when messing up when you're not around, it would be ingrained by now.

big empathy OP, my parents and sister are the same. six years and counting and mum still gets it wrong regularly.
It takes people a little while to correct themselves.  It took my little brother 6 months to adjust.  He never messes it up now.  Meanwhile the rest of my family still uses the wrong name.
But what I‚Äôm saying is like if your brother did it in 6 then is anyone else supposed to get with the program because he did? I mean yeah 3 years I can understand but there‚Äôs no one size fits all to this
It‚Äôs a simple change. People will immediately correct when told they‚Äôre wrong about an animal‚Äôs sex.  People will immediately change when a woman gets married and changes her name or vice versa.  Or when someone goes by a nickname.

Not putting the effort to change a simple habit for trans people when they do make a change in almost any other setting is plain disrespect.  I gave my family years to make a simple change.  In the time I gave them, we had a marriage in the family and they all immediately swapped last names for the bride. They chose not to make a change for me because they don‚Äôt respect me for my being trans.  It‚Äôs as simple as that."	12kv2e3	trans	217	0.96	2023-04-13 16:39:30
My parents told me I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt be making drastic, life-altering decisions until I‚Äôm 18‚Äù - all I wanted was for them to call me by a different name.	"They say I should ‚Äúbe the person I want them to be‚Äù while I‚Äôm living in their home, as if I haven‚Äôt been trying to do that the whole time. The only reason they even know I‚Äôm trans is because my brother outed me to them, so if it weren‚Äôt for him they wouldn‚Äôt even know. They expect me to open up to them, and then they respond like this when I actually do. They treat me like shit, and then expect me to want to talk to them about anything. Ever since they found out they‚Äôve been watching videos about trans athletes and all the ‚Äúevil doctors giving their innocent totally cisgender children irreversible surgery before they‚Äôre old enough to even think apparently‚Äù and they‚Äôve been aggressively misgendering me at every opportunity and then getting mad when I express that it makes me uncomfortable. 

I don‚Äôt know, I felt I had to get all this out somewhere. I‚Äôm in the car with them right now and I have no one else to talk to. God I hate the summer holidays. I hate how everyone around me gets along with their families and has no problem enjoying themselves while I have to spend six weeks wishing I could go back to school, where at the very least I feel safe."	"I experienced this too. it's awful to hear the people you care about say things like that. as much as it hurt, I had to give my mum time to wrap her head around it and she educated herself on her own. my dad is a different story, but we have good days and bad days. you'll move past this horrible purgatory, and find brighter days and better people to surround yourself with. I can only hope your parents will figure out that they were wrong, and learn what they need to, in order to join you on your journey and the rest of your life <3
Damn I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, but who said Family had to be blood? Do you possibly have friends you can go hang with and if your parents don‚Äôt understand or don‚Äôt want too, it‚Äôs their loss. Stay positive üíï
I know and that‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm scared to come out. Also, I may be a child, but I can think better than lots of adults can, as evident by the fact that I‚Äôm not flat earther
Does anyone else just want to be the living shit out of parents like this? They piss me off so much
I under stand the whole wait till your 18. That would be a rule i would have with my kids.   I have 4. And yea mtf as you would say but if my kids said yeah i wanna change. I would urge then to wait till the 18. Just because its a really big change and its a big one for a child to make with bo life experinces. But i would offer to help and get them ready if they so choose after they turn 18. But yeah. I just dont want them to think they want to then it be too late or have gone to far and would cause broblems with them returning to the way they where if you catch my meaning
Respond like what?
They told you what any responsible adult would tell there child. 
""Do not make any drastic changes until you are 18""....If they didn't care, you would no longer be living there.
Whatever you may do today, can affect and carryover for the remainder of your life. You have just barely begun to live. You are still in the 1st chapter of your life. Trans is not a game or a trend. It's a miserable misunderstood life. It gets better, but you have no idea just how difficult it is. Alot of individuals change what they feel by 18 or 19 yrs of age, while some don't and age becomes a pretty good sign you are needing some professional advice and help.
Don't get hung up on caring parents or pronouns, like I read about many who do. If it turns out you are truly Transgender, trust me, HE/SHE is the least of your battles
Honestly, I hope you‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt want to have to cut myself off from them entirely but sometimes I really feel like they don‚Äôt want to bother to educate themselves or listen to my point of view. 
Thank you for your words of encouragement, though. I really needed that today :)
Yepppp
Blockers at least, and social transition would be cool by me. But I guess I'd be a better parent than you and OP's parents
All OP asked their parents for, was use of different pronouns and name, I fail to see how their parents reaction is in any way appropriate, and how you think it is. This isn't a drastic change, its something for their own mental well being. And if you were able to not care about pronouns, or parents caring about you, good for you, but it does affect a lot of people, hell even cis people hate being misgendered, and when your own parents, people who are supposed to care for you actively do it, it hurts.
I understand holding off surgery, but I never said anything which even related to that. I wanted my parents to use the name and pronouns I feel comfortable with - there‚Äôs nothing drastic or life changing about that. And believe me, if I thought this was all just a game or a trend I certainly would‚Äôve given up on it by now.
Ya know, I‚Äôm a little older too but just because we went through a lot of bullshit doesn‚Äôt mean every trans person should have to.  Your experience is not representative of every trans person - I for one would have loved to have the option to begin transition and delay male puberty when I was a kid.  Would have saved countless hours and thousands of dollars in expense to get even mediocre results.

In OP‚Äôs case, they‚Äôre simply talking about using a different name.  Sounds like it‚Äôs the parents that are jumping to conclusions based on negative media around trans people.
Blockers at least, and social transition would be cool by me. But I guess I'd be a better parent than you and OP's parents
I remember how it feels and what I needed someone to tell me, I just hope you guys can find a way forward :)
Like i said nothing that would not be reversible.

Did you not read my response or the thread at all?
I agreed with the parents stating ""Do not make any drastic changes, until 18""....
What part of that do you disagree with. Don't go into any great detail about something I didn't say, tell me what is wrong with the parents request.
My comment was only regarding there response that you wrote.
""DONT MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES UNTIL YOU ARE 18""
That's all I was referring to. There calling you by he/her wasn't anything I mentioned. I agree with there comment. I've lived it, I know.
The pronoun thing will be a ""You"" thing most of your life, if you allow it to be. You will find it's annoying but the least of your battles going forward. Don't look to be offended because it will make it harder on a situation that's hard enough. I wish you the very best moving forward. 
Think everything through and get the best advice possible. Listen to more than one side, and do not hate those that just don't understand. Parents are important, and right now the most important thing in your life. Give them time, give yourself time. They love you and just want the best, keep that in mind
I poked around their comments on other things, they're a Republican, so honestly. Not super surprised by their stance on respecting parents and all that after seeing that.
There we go, now it's comprehensible. I'd disagree, if a kid's got a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and made it very clear that their gender does not match the one assigned at birth from a very young age then medical transition should be allowed. For some people transition is the only way they see to stay alive
Can you please re-write the second sentence. It's not only soporific, it's barely human in its structure. I've understood a cat's meow better than that sentence
Ya know what, gonna be blunt. Cause its fucking stupid, what can someone do before being a legal adult without a guardians permission? Seriously tell me. I got the same thing from my parents at 19, so its obviously not something told to only people under 18. So unless OP can somehow trick a Social security office worker into thinking someone else is their parent, their legal name isnt changing. Usually need a parents permission to set up everything to go through the arduous process of getting on HRT. Surgery, falls under the same umbrella of issues as HRT, but even worse.


If you can give me even one drastic change that is realistically achievable while still a minor, I will be absolutely amazed.
Who the getting easier brick?
Yeah they seem like an idiotic ""I struggled so you must also"" type of individual. Best ignored and downvoted.
Ok so how old are you. This would be a person by person. Not a group. Not everyone is the same. You at the age of 18 are not set in stone nor will you be the same person at 21 that you where at 18. Life changes. I wouldn‚Äôt want my kids to make a choice they could not undo. Thats what im saying. Now as to present as the other that fine by me. Just dont want them to make a bad choice.
Wow you know you lost when you go after grammar
One drastic change

""MATURITY""

Don't preach to me about this, it's difficult to take it seriously. I've got children, a mortgage and I'm a business owner. I came from a time when ""TRANSGENDER"" wasn't a word yet. When it could not be talked about and there was no one available to help in any way. Decisions were made without support or guidance. Wrong ones as well as good ones. Denial and hiding for the majority of my life.
But since I've lived it, and survived it, I've got a pretty good grasp on the right way and the wrong way.
What you think you know, you don't, and what you know, you can't be sure of at a young age. Parents see this, simply because they were young long before you. Don't hate because you feel offended, no one like to be told no ...It's good solid sound advice. ""DONT MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES UNTIL YOU ARE 18""....I'm betting the parents pay, clothe and support 100% of her existence. There child's best interest is in mind. Don't confuse love and caring with hate and disrespect.
1. My age is irrelevant and it's disclosure poses a security risk. 
2. The only one who knows what's best for a kid is that kid, not parents, not a psychiatrist, the kid.
No I just literally have no clue what the hell your sentence means
\>Ever since they found out they‚Äôve been watching videos about trans   
athletes and all the ‚Äúevil doctors giving their innocent totally   
cisgender children irreversible surgery before they‚Äôre old enough to

every opportunity and then getting mad when I express that it makes me   
uncomfortable.  


  
yes, because this is definitely the behavior of loving caring parents... who want the best for their child.... yeah...  


i hope the dripping sarcasm came through  


on another note, just because they clothe you and feed you, doesnt make them good parents, it means they manage to meet the bare minimum, if that. and that isnt even something i came up with, i got that from my father, regarding his parents, so you cant say that one is an immature stance.  


also, just so ya know, i think you misgendered OP in there
Point said. Kid.  And as for age its shows.

Zoey, you've got this.  And a loving dad, too, it seems, that would be honored to have that discussion with his daughter.
My wife and I have been together for ten years. Over that decade, she has told me more than once that she'd be okay with me being trans. I finally came out last year and I was still scared to death. Now I wish I'd done it sooner.
My dad did this but then followed it up by saying some really terrible things ;w;
Oh that‚Äôs a fuckin bait if I ever seent one. Do it. Time to come out of the closet Zoey. It‚Äôs getting cramped in there and everyone can tell.
I'm wondering if he actually dreamed that or just said it to make OP feel safe about coming out
True
You know this isn't the first time something happened like this. Once he saw my internet search history when I was a lot younger and just questioning. I'm ashamed to admit that my mom probably knows I used to steal her underwear. Additionally in conversation I've ""slipped up"" a few times (just being who I am isn't really a slip up I know). I've said things like haven't you ever wanted to be a girl and also accidentally put myself in the situation of the trans person when we are talking about random news. Because of all this history I don't wanna be too complicated about how I come out. I don't wanna play the see how it goes game. I've been backing out for wayyy too long. I def appreciate your advice, but for me, I don't want to go into it conditionally. The path to live the way I want travels straight through the center of telling my mom and dad town. I've got to tell him and I want to do it tonight.

Transphobe can't grasp the concept of other languages	"Context: they responded to a comment of mine, in wich I was making fun of another transphobe who got mad at an artist for drawing a t4t morticia and gomez headcanon 

Ele/dele means He/him in Portuguese

Did you tell them how stupid they are? You should. Those ppl should feel like they are the dumbest idiots this planet has to offer. (Because they are)
I believe that it wouldn't be incorrect to call that xenophobia. What a coincidence that a transphobe is also a xenophobe.
I mean are you really expecting people to have any understand of languages when they fail to comprehend that the singular they has been use at least since 1300 to refer to a person of unknown gender or when either gender (saying either because of historical context*) was impliable.

It needs citation.
I've seen on Twitter a transphobe saying hƒ≥/hem is *""a mental illness""* and that it's hard to talk to people with *""mental illness""* (rampart Ableism)

And the dude said ""Hƒ≥/Hem is Dutch for He/Him""
 if they can‚Äôt get the grasp that portuguese exists, i suggest they use study/more
Sie/Ihr
Ummm‚Ä¶this guy sucks, but where can I find the T4T Gomez and Morticia?
Is it Finnish? I actually have experiences with Finnish, and I must say that letter is actually pretty easy to pronounce.
to be fair sa is for anyone
I told them that it was he/him but in Portuguese and their response was ""Well why the fuck do you need both pronouns in your profile? And you all keep making up new pronouns and shit everyday so idk""
what exactly are you expecting to happen? they'll just go ""oh you're right I'm so stupid""? the best way to handle these kinds of people is to not handle them. the best part about being online is that you can just block them and they can't do anything about it. noone gives a shit about anyone else's opinion unless it matches their own, which begs the question as to why I'm writing this reply in the first place. 

regardless of the self-referential ideals of this reply, don't engage with these people. ignoring them is the best way to preserve your peace of mind and happiness. ignorance is bliss
True, and it's not even a ""you don't have a country in your bio"" since I literally have a BR on my bio wich they looked at
Yeah I mean, you can't expect inteligence from transphobes
I'm sure it was 1100s, and not 1300s.
Transphobes everyday embarrassing themselves
For real
You can find it on @notdayle on Insta
Plus Finnish has no gender even in pronouns
Yep! Ahh, that's good. Depends on the person.
Tru ur right, forgot about that
(Even if i am french myself lmao)
Doesn't ""sa"" mean ""her"", while ""son"" means ""him""? (so elle/sa as feminine pronouns and il/son as masculine pronouns)

&#x200B;

It's been about 3 years since I stopped learning french, so maybe I just have bad memory idk XD It's such a beautiful language, maybe I should start learning it again, I simply stopped bc it didn't make sense for me to choose french as a subject for exams in the Abitur (german version of the high-school diploma).
lol
Guess he still lives in the 1940s
For fox lake singular they dates back to the 14th century, Ze dates back to at least 1864 and ey/em/eir Dates back to 1975. How dumb are people getting?
Imo those ppl should feel hated by everyone all the time.
Actually i'm not sure, i just realised i forgot to cite my claim. So i'm not entirely certain but i do remember citing something from 1300sor possibly earlier.

Tho it's important to mention that generic he was also use which would correspond to german generic er (i think) tho that isn't quite relevant.

KJB is i think where it's first attested, but again needs citation.
Also *""Those are not my pronouns! They are what I use to edit* (images)*""*.
Their art is so good! Thank you!
To be honest, a language with no gendered pronouns is always a nice language.
I was confused at first because its my first time seeing ""h√§nen"" I've never seen that written down because we don't have to bring up pronouns in finnish, since its always ""h√§n"" xD
Hahaha and i'm a french learner, wish me luck.
No.
I knew I should have taken my own advice, hatred is the reason this whole dilemma even exists. hatred propagates hatred
No problem!
Well se/sen is used more anyway. Kinda funny how I'm fine being called that in Finnish, but in English I don't like it/its pronouns.
Oh I think remember, in french using sa or son depends on wether the article that would be written in front of the subject is feminine or masculine, so ""her dog"" would be ""son chien"" (bc it's ""UN chien"") and ""her baguette"" would be ""sa baguette"" ( bc it's ""UNE baguette), right?

French grammar really confuses me XD
Sure, just ignore the problem. Maybe it will go away on its own (no it wont).
Do you mean in like a day to day speech or like for finnish enby people? Tbh I should probably be in more finnish trans spaces. I'm so out of the loop, all the media I consume is foreign

Edit: that actually flew over my head completely bc saying ""se"" is so natural to me, didnt even think we call ppl ""it"" lol I see your point now
yes, his and her are the same, it changes according to the noun it is describing, like all other adjectives
Yep!
where will calling them stupid get you? into a senseless argument.

where will ignoring them get you? peace of mind.

ignoring them is a net 0 but it's still far better for yourself than getting upset over something you can't even change.

noone can change anyone else's opinions, which also is self referencing because here I am still talking to someone who is clearly not listening to me. I suppose all I can hope for is that one day you'll see I'm right.

on top of this, calling one of these people ""stupid"" in the way your original post was constructed is likely going to earn you the badge of sounding like a child. you would be ridiculed to no end.

 before you go on about how I'm ""just another stupid transphobe"" don't ridicule yourself. I am nonbinary.

based on the way you have formulated your comments i assume you are quite young which is why I have been so adherent to not stoop to your level. if you are an adult, you really do need to learn when to stop talking because one day you will run your mouth too far to someone and most likely get punched.

My best friend thinks that I am making a mistake by being trans and is wanting me to convert to Christianity	"Please forgive any spelling or grammar errors it‚Äôs late and I‚Äôm dyslexic so it is probably not going to be the best.(I would also like to state that this is my first time posting anything and I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do so I‚Äôm here)


I(16ftm) have two best friends who I‚Äôll be calling One(17M) and Two(18M) becauseI can‚Äôt think of anything else. 

So back in December of 2020 before I came out as trans to anyone I meant two guys and we really hit it off and we had ups and downs but I feel like it is safe for me to say that they are the best friends I have ever had, I came out to them as lesbian that summer and then again as a trans man last Christmas Two has always been supportive of me and is in fact the first person I told about it all. But today for some reason  One wanted to talk about politics in  private chat (me and him have very different views on politics and Unlike him I personally don‚Äôt believe in any religion because I don‚Äôt think I can be for sure) at first I was a bit annoyed because I have stated several times to him that I do not like having those talks with him but one think led to another and it got to the point that I had to just end the conversation because I know how stubborn One can be with this stuff. After that I assumed all was good until he asked me if he could ask me a question but I would have to promise that I wouldn‚Äôt get mad (it‚Äôs very hard to piss me off, even after our long political debate ) but the question honestly wasn‚Äôt that bad, he just wanted to know why I was trans, I tried the best that I could to explain it but it wasn‚Äôt enough for him, he kept talking to me about how I might regret it later and that as my friend it is his duty to stop me from making bad decisions( I haven‚Äôt started any of the actual physical transition yet but I talk a lot about it) I tried to stay calm and see where he was coming from but his only talking point is that I might regret it later and I am only a teenager so I shouldn‚Äôt be able to know who I am yet, by this time me and Two got on a call In the public call and I started to tell him the situation, he got pissed and asked if I wanted him to curse One out but I said no,  me and One continued our conversation and it led to the fact that I‚Äôm not christian and that he is scared that I‚Äôll go to hell if I don‚Äôt convert. I know he means well but I guess the part that hits the hardest is that we are all going to the beach together tomorrow and idk what I am going to say to him, he is still my best friend and I know he just wants to help but I don‚Äôt think he understands.



Again I am sorry for all my grammar and spelling mistakes I just don‚Äôt know what to do I don‚Äôt want to lose my best friends (that is not a option for me )


Also me and them all live two hours away so meet ups are rare.(we all talk for at least a hour a day for the past two years)


Edit: I would just like to say thank you for all of your kind words of  advise although while reading through them I can across a  common miss conception, One didn‚Äôt think I was going to hell because I was trans, he just thought I would because I‚Äôm a atheist (also I was raised catholic and I just can‚Äôt go back to religion) the reason I brought it up is because it was very intertwined with our conversation about me being trans.   Also We talked this morning and he apologized for what he said and said he only did it because he was confused and only wanted to here my take on it and that why he wouldn‚Äôt just look up a YouTube video or something.


Well anyway thank you all so much and I will definitely keep what you have all said in mind as I move forward. <3"	"""As my friend it's his duty to stop me from making bad decisions""

When gender dysphoria if involved it isn't a decision. It just seems that way from the outside. You didn't choose to be trans, you simply are who you are and your brain is telling you that.

Also you can explain that being trans doesn't actually stop you from being Christian. Fun fact: The Bible doesn't actually talk about transgender people at all. 

Your allowed to believe whatever you want about religion but a good portion of trans people don't like Christianity because the people who follow it can be so controlling. Kinda like he is being by trying to force you to make his 'right decision' and covering up his control as self righteous duty.
If someone says that you're going to hell for living your truth, then they're not your friend.
If I were in your shoes, I would respond with something like.

 ""Unless you're also experiencing gender dysphoria, there's no way for you to understand what's going on in my heart.  
I'm really hurt that you even brought this up and if you value our friendship you won't bring this up again."" 

The fact of the matter is he's way overstepping his boundaries and you don't deserve that. This makes the next step on him. 

(Also let your other friend know what's going on if you haven't already. The fact that he wanted to say it in private makes me feel like he knows this was fucked of him but either way it's important for everyone to know what's going on when there's something like this happening in the friend group.)
You want to be friends with someone who doesn‚Äôt understand how you feel and doesn‚Äôt want to, thinks you don‚Äôt understand your own feelings, thinks it‚Äôs his job to regulate you decisions about your life, thinks you belong in hell for them? I‚Äôm sorry but I think he‚Äôs always going to be transphobic. I think all you can do is end the friendship, I don‚Äôt see how it can work. Two sounds like an actual friend to you. He is supportive and clearly upset by one‚Äôs behavior. I‚Äôm sorry if this all sounds insensitive but people like two are not worth the effort and no amount of talk will ever convince him.
Tell them Jesus was trans. Mary was a virgin therefore genetically the only possible chromosomes for her offspring was XX*, but Jesus clearly identified as a man. Trans Jesus. 

*not sure if XXX is also possible in this case but my point still stands
The two aren't mutually exclusive. Your friend judging you for being trans is not behaving like a real Christian. Christians are supposed to love G_d, love each other and not judge.
Realizing that, is why I came back. Not to the church but to faith in those three things. I can be trans and Christian.
Telling someone they cannot be themselves is not Christian. Jesus sought out the people that polite society rejected. Anyone who does anything contrary is doing it wrong.
I would tell one to do some research about trans. There are sooooooo many trans studies, but if he refuses to do some proper research, then he will forever be an ignorant transphobe. Which thats just something you will have to accept.
Hopefully his understanding and acceptance grows better. I had some pretty backwards and ignorant viewpoints when I was a teenager too. I'm a bit concerned that the topic of hell came up. I've never really cared for the notion off an all loving god that's willing to send people who don't love him in just the right way to an eternal pain dimension.

I don't really think this brand of fear mongering is okay and I wish Christians would recognize how abusive it is not just to the people they're trying to convert, but to each other as well.

I'm not telling you to completely disregard your friend. Hopefully he figures some of this stuff out as he gets older. (Though it's up to you whether or not you want to put up with his growth or lack thereof.) Mainly making this post to give an explicitly atheist perspective.
Hi there,
first of all, so sorry you have this struggle with your friend.
I also have a friend who has a hard time wrapping her head around me being trans. Or transitioning in general. She keeps asking me to explain it in a way she can understand but nothing I say is enough for her to see why I need to medically transition. I am 37 years old, so she at least can't say I wouldn't be old enough to know.

By the end of the day, I know how you feel. It is especially hard not to be angry because our friends come from a place of caring. But your friend has to understand that while we rely on our friends to voice doubts to help in making decisions it is NOT their responsibility to keep us from making decisions that are mistakes in their eyes. 
A friend should voice concern, but accept and support your decision in the long run. 

My advise is: Go meet them. Tjey are your friends. Tell 'One' that you appreciate his concern, tell him how you feel about your decision and that he does not need to fully understand where you're coming from to accept and support you.

In the end it is your life and you need to go your way the way it feels right for you. Friends and family are great company who can aid us in our decisions when we ask for advise but should never intervene just because they do not understand. How could they understand? We are all individual beings with individual feelings.
As a friend it‚Äôs also his duty to allow you to make good decisions. You can‚Äôt make those if you let anything you might regret later stop you from doing it, especially if it‚Äôs not actually likely you will regret it later. 

I don‚Äôt know how much of his arguements are part of him and how much is only repeating what others have said, but for me it would be really hard to be friends with someone who struggles to accept religious differences (which the transphobia seems part of to me) A fear of hell is not something I‚Äôve been taught growing up, so it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôll ever fully understand, but I think similarly people who do fear going to hell like your friend does, can‚Äôt understand not everyone believes in hell or wants to live their life according to that. That can make friendship really difficult and I think your friend does need to question their beliefs a bit to make it work
I don't like that friend one bit. I would actually say he's not friendly at all. Pushing religious beliefs on someone else is never okay. And it doesn't say in the Bible that transgender people will go to hell anyway. It doesn't say anything bad about LGBTQ+ people. People like your friend are just brainwashed to be hateful. Ask him, where in the Bible does it say you're going to hell for being true to yourself? Gender is not a choice. It's just what you are. The choice is to suffer in silence or be proud.
Fuck your friend leave them and move on
I didn't even read the body. Just based on the title alone, dump that friend. You deserve someone who accepts you for who you are. Not someone who thinks you need to ""change"".

Even if you would go through their recommended conversion I doubt they'd stick around through the hardship that is neglecting your happiness and self expression.
You deserve better friends, dear.
He absolutely does NOT have a duty to make decisions about your life for you! His duty at worst is to mind his own business and at best to support you, if he can't do the latter then the default is the former. Fucking Christians thinking they have the moral right to dictate what other people do, they can all just fuck off to the fictional hell that they have their perverse wet dreams about. OP, this is not OK. He's not your friend, he just wants you in a box that he can control and manipulate.
Life's too short for transphobic friends. You deserve better

Sending virtual hugs ‚ù§Ô∏è
Beware ‚ÄúHoly Joes‚Äù.
Ghost this "" beat friend"" they're not your friend. Friends dont try to coerce friends into death cults.
That's psychological manipulation. And gullable.
His question was wrong in the first place. You can't answer why you are trans. If anything you can answer why you think you are trans. Being trans is not a choice after all.

He is trying to help you. But he doesn't understand the situation and that way he will only hurt you.
Ill be frank on this one, people who think like this, you cant change their minds and it only gets worse. I had a friend who was exactly the same, really nice guy at the time and someone who I never would have thought would just turn on me and FO. This was over stupid Trump politics and Qanon so if he knew I was trans he probably would have lost his shit but at the time I was not. Long story short turns out he had some serious mental illness that he had to deal with and also harassed his ex with 50 fucking Facebook accounts... So these people are not who you think they are. If you want to remain friends with this person avoid talking about this like the plague but honestly if it keeps up its more likely your friendship is going to end in a weird way.
Tell him if he truly believes that ""as my friend it is his duty to stop me from making bad decisions"", then he has absolutely zero faith in God's plan, believing that he must intervene on your behalf.  Either he can live his life as an example of what to be and just trust in God, or he can be a fake and just try to use the Bible to control others.  Whatever.  I try to avoid these conversations personally, but I get really mad when a zealot (of any ideology) tries to force convert someone, even with just peer pressure.
Well, Christianity is not trans exclusive, if nothing else you can tell them the Bible supports trans people
You should do both.  Only a truly evil person who has never read scripture would imply they are mutually exclusive.
he is not being a good friend for multiple reasons, some of which don‚Äôt really even have to do with being friends.

friends don‚Äôt corner you into conversations you don‚Äôt want to have. friends don‚Äôt try to control you and claim it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs their duty to do so. friends don‚Äôt try to convert you against your will to another belief system.

good friends meet you where you are and accept you. i‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this.
""I like you, One, you have been a great friend all this time, however I am not religious and have no wish to be so,  and I know in my heart what I am and what I want, and if you cannot respect that and accept me as I am, then we can no longer be friends. I need support and understanding, not misguided attempts at conversion therapy, however much you believe what you do. I really hope you can understand, and that we can move on.""
so i skipped the comments but didn't see this yet. you said the question isn't bad but can he answer the question why he is cis? if the answer is cause it's normal reply being trans is the normal for you. there's ot really a deeper answer. it's not really a bad question but it is a stupid one in my opinion. a good questions would be: what made you discover you're trans? what made you think you might be trans? cause there's no clear answer why ppl are trans or cis (maybe some biologists in the far future will find out but rn there isn't). and a random trans guy like you won't know the answer.

btw: i am happy for you he apologized. seems he's improving and that's awesome.
Run. Christianity is a bad, mean spirited faith overall. Your friend is clearly not part of the Christians who are kind and tolerant. Im sorry. But it appears thos friendship is over.
I believe they're just trying to help you. I think their train of thought is heading towards it doesn't hurt to be Christian and if you don't convert then you'll spend an eternity in hell. It cost you nothing now but it will cost everything later. (I'm atheist and I am very highly considering converting)
How you feel has nothing to do with what a book says. If you feel like you wanna dress different and wish that you could look like something closer to what you feel in your heart. Don't let anyone tell you that this feeling is wrong. I let a cis washed world tell me over and over again. If you honestly feel like you wanna live and dress as the other way around that's is a line of thinking that is anything but cis gendered. I realized when I was 32 that I would rather die than age in a male body. I knew when I was 3 then remembered when I was 11 then remembered again at 17, 21 and 28. It took me till I was 32 to actually embrace it. My point in sharing this is it illustrate that these feelings don't change. Don't let anybody makes your decisions for you. If they can't respect your choices then they don't respect you. Please respect yourself enough to act on what makes you happy; not everyone else.
/\ that!
The bible doesnt talk about transgender people


>!Well clearly they didnt talk about them because they didn‚Äôt exist until now!!<

[deleted]
Jesus could have been 46, XX intersex. Having the reproductive organs of a female but the outward genital appearance could be similar to a male.
Also some older Christian writers characterized Jesus as both male and female in various ways, the catholic church just didn't agree so the tradition didn't survive
Well. Yes and no. Transgender people weren't recognised until recent modern times. 

But historically we were always there. Historical examples exist of renaissance Italians addressing people who are identify as something close to what we call transgender.

They had a different term but the recognition still remained.
Huh. I'm gonna have to look that up.

All I know is that in renaissance Italy they didn't really care about men dressing as women as long as they assumed the social roles of women as well.

This was especially prevalent in some Italian city states (Florence) over others (Venice). 

So clearly Christianity had evolved beyond Deuteronomy 22:5 by the 1400's. At least in some areas.
Fair point, I don‚Äôt know enough about the mechanism of how the genetics shake out for intersex people so I left that out haha.
I know, I was just making fun of transphobes
[deleted]
Fair enough.
I'm mainly talking about how Christianity is used as a tool of control especially against minorities such as trans people. Interpretation of the Bible is a big part of that. 

Interpretation changes over time. As a history student it angers me that Christianity is used as a weapon against transgender people. Especially when I know that medieval fucking Catholics, who were hardly the most progressive people in the goddamn world, are somehow further ahead of the curve on trans rights than some Christians today."	vmfuyi	trans	192	0.98	2022-06-28 05:55:46
Welp, I've caught the big C19	Yep, I got COVID-19 and it sucks. Mad donkey nuts right now. My nose is all stuffed up, I'm sweating like crazy, my throat is an absolute pain, and my tear ducts have been going nuts since 4:00. I've decided to stop taking my HRT at the moment because I'm taking so many other medications and I don't know what is going to do to my body, I'm probably going to have to cancel my way. I can have a little bit of money saved up. Transitioning with COVID sucks so bad, I already had to stop because I lost my job The first time but now I'm going to have to stop again because of covid and I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to start again. Who knows. And I wasn't one of those reckless people, I wore a mask every single day at work religiously, I made sure to spray now my clothes like a neat freak all the time and I took so many precautions but still managed to get it. Well crap...	">I've decided to stop taking my HRT at the moment because I'm taking so many other medications and I don't know what is going to do to my body, I'm probably going to have to cancel my way.

Depending on how long you've been taking HRT, it might be advisable to keep on taking it! Don't ruin your hormone balance while you already feel bad because of covid. 

But in the end it's your decision though, Get well soon!
Yep. I got it 3 weeks ago, and it got my FFS canceled. My insurance deductible is already paid in full this year, and I was supposed to get FFS on Aug 2nd, fully covered. But no, I had to get Covid. Now, its pushed out into 2023, which means I have to pay another full out of pocket deductible.

Covid can suck ass...
Talk to your doctor if they green light the HRT then you'll have peace of mind.
this new strain of covid is even getting those who are vaccinated, a handful of my friends got it. If only everyone that COULD get vaccinated when they rolled out we wouldn't be here
I also have COVID. I‚Äôve had it for about a week now. I‚Äôve been taking my HRT and there‚Äôs been no issues. I am pissed because I had to postpone a first date that I was really looking forward to because of it though.
ugh that really sucks I hope that you will be okay!!! make sure to rest a TON, like no exertion unless you feel 100% back to normal, and drink lots of water and electrolyte drinks if you have em and eat nutritious food. and quarantine a full 10 days.

it sucks so bad when you've been super careful too, that has been me as well. I wear N95s everywhere and mostly don't go places, I have sacrificed so much and endured so much isolation for the sake of keeping myself and my community safe. Still ended up getting it as soon as mask mandates got lifted, from my roommate because she has no choice but to take public transit to work. 

wishing you a speedy and full recovery ‚ù§
If you're not over 60 and don't have any serious underlying diseases you'll most likely be fine. Covid is nothing to worry about more than a heavy flu. In terms of effect they seem very comparable.
Try to rest, drink lots of fluids. Consider calling the advice nurse (most insurance/dr. Offices have one) to get advice on hrt. My gut reaction is to keep taking them. Sending healthy, healing vibes, and love. :)
Good luck! I was out for a solid week when I got it recently. I also felt like ‚Äúshould I take these hormones? I can barely move‚Ä¶‚Äù and it was ultimately the only thing I could get out of bed for.

God speed ‚ù§Ô∏è
I kept taking mine when I got covid and got the same symptoms as you. My doctor was the one who said to keep taking it, so I think you should better talk with yours
I hate COVID so much
ugh that is devastating i'm so sorry :(
Ah fuck me, how many stains can override vaccines??
I'm fully vaccinated, fully boosted,  had covid back in 2020 (so my immune system knows how to fight it), wear masks, and still got it again a few weeks ago. Fortunately this time around wasn't as bad as the last time. Just high fever, fatigue, aches, and headaches. Last time I had to visit the hospital. 

I'm also immunocompromised, so that doesn't help.
This statement is a huge insult to the millions of people struggling to get on with their lives as they deal with the impact of ‚Äúlong covid.‚Äù

read this article about brain damage please.

also like. this is a disgusting comment. I've been seeing obituaries for CHILDREN from this disease. just because you're not paying attention doesn't mean this is no big deal.
My younger brother lost his sense of smell for almost half a year after getting covid, and still doesn't recognize certain smells every now and then. He basically has to relearn to associate smells with certain things.

Yeah, most younger people will survive.. But it's not to be guaranteed without some scars.
All strains. 
Vaccines protect against, but do not prevent, illness. 

Also, people are getting very behind on boosters currently. Corona virus vaccines typically only offer maximum protection for 6 months or so.

I'm sorry you caught it, op. I hope you get well soon!
i caught it prior to my booster, had the thing even scheduled up for myself and I had to call them and cancel so my spot could get filled. The main thing I hated was I was stuck at home, and couldn't really do anything for myself. Though my mom and my partner's parents did some porch drop-offs with some things.
Please explain this to me like I'm a five year old. Imo it's just as insulting to a lottery winner to say the chances of winning are very low. It's factual, like we're all going to die eventually, it's not a fun thought but it's an unavoidable truth we just have to live with.
No, and please learn to read before accusing me, that's offensive too.
I'm sorry to hear that. Of course there will be cases of illness and even death but the same can be said for driving a car. Every time someone gets into their car someone can die. I don't see people freaking out over that. Sure there are people who get hit but most don't. Apparently socially it's acceptable to take such a risk. Same with covid, op will probably live. Hope your brother gets well.
This. Also at least in my case of covid I had in Janurary was kinda mild. But felt like the worst allergy symptoms of my life
It is estimated that as many as two million Americans are out of work or are struggling to get back to work because of the ongoing symptoms of covid. Dizziness, shortness of breath, exhaustion. For months. Possibly becoming years. How is this just like the flu?
The numbers are questionable and in our country apparently top secret. When asked about these numbers either the question is avoided or negated by some document which has no direct relation to 'numbers'. Our government is willing to pay a penalty for not releasing these numbers, paid for by tax of course. Personally I'd like to see them for once, and not some doctored diagram based on half working tests and financial interest.

What I notice in my personal environment is a small percentage gets complications or what not, the rest actually compare it to a flu. Nobody here seems to bothered by it any more as well. Yet a very small percentage is still afraid, they're afraid of many other things as well, there are a lot of uncertainties in life. Some are vaccinated some aren't, some are followers of 'main stream media', some watch solely conspiracy channels. But in the end it seems as though people don't seem to die or get long term effects as much. They still do of course and it sucks, but it doesn't mean everyone should panic about such a small risk. Panic or not, either it gets you or it doesn't, panicking makes it worse (heightened stress levels etc). I do notice people getting complications after being vaccinated though, but I can't say that of course. Seems like the percentage of that checks out with the pfizer docs though. Whatever it may be, only time will tell."	wj9q7d	trans	188	0.95	2022-08-08 14:06:17
I got gendered correctly way longer before I knew myself OwO	"So, in my case my name sounds female to most part of the world, although it's a male name in my home country. So, all my life I was being called Ms. in letters with them using female pronouns ü§≠ And it always made me so happy üôà Meanwhile my mom was always so mad about it üòÖ Does anyone had any similiar experiences ? üëÄ

Oh btw, I just recently found out I'm actually trans, so that's a sign I completely ignored smh. And I thought once I could be trans but I had some misconceptions in my mind, so I stayed with being gay until some time ago ü§ß"	"Maybe slightly related, I was very jealous of a Russian immigrant student at my high-school because his name was Sasha. I don't even have a particularly masc dead name üòÇ
When I was younger I would grow my hair out and pretty much get it cut once a year, so in middle school a boy thought I was a girl from behind, I remember feeling conflicted at the time lol
Some people have thought I was a boy before. I believe it‚Äôs because of my short haircut and beeg comfy clothing that covers all of me and lack of makeup‚Ä¶.

Still cis tho
Unisex name gang unite? I have the same situation, don't have any desire to change my name because people tend to assume it's female anyway.

It never really bothered me to be misgendered, wonder why ......
I was ""misgendered"" for the first time as 3-4yo, and it went on for many years to come...using the quotation marks because most of all people going around gendering me did so to mock me, even if they accidentally got it right in a foreshadowing sense...

The first time it happened, I was sitting in a white stroller with a faint floral pattern, wearing a dark read sweater and sweatpants, sporting a typical 70/80s bowl cut for boys(even if this was in the later 90s, lol). Some tourists came up to my parents and said ""you have such a cute little girl!"", and my parents were apparently too flabbergasted to correct them...
Andrea?
Oh something similar with mine my guy name in my culture was a girl name in Chinese so people familiar with Chinese names would think I'm a girl. When I was still young/silly enough to use my name as my username in online games like clash of clans people would just think I was a girl.
I passed from my mid teens to early 20's.  I had shoulder length hair, barely any facial hair, and no beard shadow.  I've always been skinny with a rather feminine build.  I've always looked young for my age.  I wore nothing but baggy t-shirts and cargos, but I still passed constantly.  Guys would come in the men's room, see me, go out and check the sign, come back in, and ask ""Am I in the wrong bathroom, or are you?""  Even when I answered, they'd still look confused.  Kids at school mocked me cause I ""looked like a girl"".  When I met new people, they always ""thought"" I was a girl at first.  It eventually got to the point where it was getting scary, and I cut my hair at 23.

I didn't finally come out til 33.  God how I wish I transitioned in my early 20's.  I was already passing without HRT.
I see üëÄ But yeah, I'm half russian myself, so interesting to see how male russian names are often perceived as female. Pbb when names end on a vocal it's rather seen as female I'd say ü§î
I know a Russian afab named Kira at birth, which I thought was only a masc name
Haha, things get more clear with time ü§≠
I remember in school being called a girl on few occasions by teachers at like age 8-12. They would apologize as soon as they realized they apparently made a mistake, and I didn't really know yet either... but it did make me smile a little, too.
Yeah, the portaying of gender is still really bound to such things. Wonder when it's gonna break completely and things getting more fluid. Not that I say it's not allowed to be the way a male/female is supposed to be by society but I just really hope these boundaries get more fluid and less important in the future ‚úåüèª
Well, I do wanna change my name cause yeah, it might be perceived female but the fact it was intentionally a male name for me is what makes me actually wanna change the name. And it's close to my actual name anyways.
How did you feel about it being ""misgendered"" ? üëÄ I don't mean for now but in a retrospective way
Idk what you mean by that but my name is not Andrea üòÖ Or did you intend to mean sth else ? ü§î
Yeah, totally know that üëÄ And how did you feel about it then ?
My dead name isn't really feminine, but I find it too much girlish to meüòÇ
Isn't Sasha short for Alexander?
Ikr, it's just deep inside in yourself. One just needs time to grow in order to bloom in the brighest colors of oneself üòä
Felt like absolute shit back then, but now I giggle on the inside üò≥
I thought your name was Andrea üòÖ 

Cus in most of the world it‚Äôs feminine except in Italy where it‚Äôs masculine
Gotta say I was pretty happy to find out, though I was still trying to pretend to be a guy at that time. When I said I was a boy in the clan chat a girl said that because of my name she knows I'm a girl pretending to be a boy which I thought was hilarious and so on the nose.
Yes, it is. At least in russia. Otherwise Sasha is an name standing by itself out of russia as I know.
Well, glad things got clear for you üíï
Oh ok, I see üëÄ So yeah, my male born name is Nikita which is a typical male name in russia and in other parts of the world it's considered female. So, since I live in Germany people are not used to male names that end with a vocal üòÖ

WOO! I know how you feel OP, it‚Äôs such a massive relief. After I got my hair cut I stopped and looked at myself in the mirror constantly (still do lol) because it‚Äôs like... that‚Äôs me.

That‚Äôs great! Enjoy your new hair, it‚Äôs so liberating.
When I was a kid, I always used to say that I wanted my hair cut. My parents always said no, ""your curls are too pretty"" as if pretty is what I was going for. 

I will NEVER forget that first hair cut. I was 23 and it totally changed my life. I felt okay about myself for the first time ever. Now I make sure I go every 4 to 6 weeks. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, reminds me that I am happy to be me the way I feel after getting a fresh cut. Congrats! I'm so excited for you.

Swedish trans man here. Not happy	"Waiting lists, waiting lists. We just love em /j

I (17) am finally putting myself on a waiting list to get the label transgender officialy smacked on my forehead; so I can start hormone treatment and eventually get surgery. 

The problem? The expected time I need to wait until I even can start the process of meeting professionals is 2 YEARS. Add on that the process itself can take anything from 1-2 years

I don't know how my fellow transgender Swedes didn't just pack their bags and move someplace else but I admire their patience. 

When it comes down to it I'm not too mad that I'll most probably start using t when I'm 20 (it's quite young) BUT I am extremely upset that Sweden still hasn't fixed a problem that's existed for a few years now. I'm not the first to complain and I won't be the last!! The people with best options are those who live in Stockholm but literally living anywhere else limits your options to Alings√•s: AKA mr please-wait-two-years-then-we'll-come-back-to-you

And I just felt so, defeated when I saw the waiting time. My whole mood just dropped and I can't imagine what I would have felt had I pushed back doing this until I'm an adult.

Sweden needs to step up their game.



(Though I'm curious how it is in other countries. Is this an issue in a lot of places?"	"It‚Äôs tough isn‚Äôt it. I‚Äôm not Swedish, I‚Äôm in the uk and I believe the current waiting time for the first appointment is 7 years(!) on the NHS. I am paying to go private and will have to wait 1 year to access T. 

In the meantime im getting on with changing my name
I thought it was bad in Denmark, but guess we should be happy with our 1-1.5 years total wait.

Have you looked into genderGP? I know they work in Denmark, at least half a year ago. They are a UK based private healthcare provider for transgender people in the UK and EU. I considered it myself, and might still try them out depending on how things evolve here.

They might operate in Sweden too.
Thank god Portugal is on the right pace, 1 year to get hormones then 1 year of hormone taking till you are put on the surgery waiting list. surgery waiting list is currently 8 months to a year!  
  
**My timeline so far:**

October 2020 - Asked to start the transition 

12th April 2021 - First Psychiatrist Evaluation 

12th October 2021 - Hormones

25th May 2022 - Second Psychiatrist Evaluation (necessary for surgeries)

**Next Appointments:**

25th October 2022 - Surgery Appointment will be scheduled

December/January: First Surgery Appointment and put on waiting list

Then wait the 8 months to a year to get a letter with the surgery date!
Same situation on public healthcare here too unfortunately (UK), I've been thinking of moving to Malta for at least a year since they have introduced an informed consent model, meaning as long as a doctor informs you about the potential side effects of HRT and you accept, they will prescribe you hormones given you are over 18 years of age. The other option is going private which would significantly reduce waiting times, but obviously it's an expensive procedure.
This is an issue in all of Europe. They insist medical gatekeeping is needed to assure people don't regret transitioning. (Its totally in our best interest y'all üôÑ). But they don't have the capacity to do the gatekeeping. Hence the long waiting time. It really sucks, the only systemic solution is more self determination for people wishing to medically transition. #TransLiberationNow
I know it used to be here in Canada until fairly recently. About ten years ago, my mom was dating this great guy, and he had mentioned some of the crap he had to go through when he had transitioned. A lot of gatekeeping and cis people telling he had to do this or that before he could even begin to expect any help. Things like expecting that you present as your desired gender for several years **before** you can access surgeries or cheap and easily available hormones. The fuckers knew exactly what they were doing, too. I would be surprised if any of them actually thought any of that bullshit did any good.

Actually, I was just talking to a wonderful young lady from Switzerland that had to jump through a bunch of hoops to get hrt, then realized that she wasn't quite ready for it. Now she's stuck. In a sane world, she could just say that she wasn't ready yet, and take the time she needs. If she's honest, though, there's a very good chance that the gatekeepers will try extra hard to stand in her way when she is ready. The one thing the whole process is supposed to fucking avoid, and it walks her right into it! It's ridiculous!

Oh! Here's a feel good thing, though. Last I heard, the trans gentleman I had mentioned had gotten successful bottom surgery. It was something he had wanted for a while, so good for him!
I feel you man. I'm from the Netherlands, waiting lists to start speaking to ANYONE here regarding transitioning are also 1-2 years. I also got put on one when I was 17; I'm now 20 and just got an appointment planned for the first meeting at my clinic. Yes, it takes incredibly long, and it will suck. But better to put yourself on the list as fast as possible from this point. You've got this. As you already said, you're not the first nor the last, and you can do this!
But we have our rights and freedom why? That üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
Even though I hate US healthcare I am thankful for how speedy it usually is. I can't imagine waiting that long.
I live in Pennsylvania in America. It took me a walk in consultation and 19 days to get hrt when i was 16
I know the struggle. Swedish as well, AFAB nonbinary. I was on a waiting list for two years, got in to see the counselor, got on the waiting list for an actual doctor who could prescribe HRT (another 18 months) and was then informed that because of covid they may not even offer that service anymore. I'm now waiting to start the process over in Malm√∂. At this rate, I'll be 50 before I even get to start on hormones. It's very frustrating.
My timeline so far:

about May '20: added ti waiting list

June/July: psychologic evaluation

August: first appointment discussing hormones, blood tests 

September 8th: starting hormones.
Similar in Norway. Here you first need to see a psychiatrist (4-6 months wait to see them) and they will evaluate you for 6-8 months. If they diagnose you with gender dysphoria you can go to the National Treatment Center for Gender Incongruence in Oslo. In Norway YOU MUST go to Oslo for treatment, no other options. There you must wait about 4-6 months for the first appointment, and they will evaluate you AGAIN for gender dysphoria, takes 8-12 months this time by two experts that evaluate you separately and both must conclude you have gender dysphoria and therefore a right to get treatment. All in all it takes 2-3 years to be allowed to take hormones here in Norway, but if you first are accepted after this long ass time getting surgery should be somewhat easy, but will take some time too. For surgery you need to be on hormones for 1 year, be evaluated again and if approved you get put on a waiting list for the surgery and I honestly don't know how long that wait is, probably 1-2 years.

Tldr: it takes 2-3 years to be allowed to get hormones in Norway and that is after tons of waiting and evaluations
English lad here , my waiting list just to be seen is also 2 years , and could be another few years to even get the diagnosis. I feel your pain . It‚Äôs horrendous

It's unfortunate how many places still insist you need to meet a specific kind of specialist psychiatrist in order to get a diag, it seems like the ""gatekeeping"" mentality described by Julia Serano is still alive and kicking in many places.

If you're willing to commit to a more personal learning-intensive path there is a DIY option that many trans people have gone for in places where getting hrt through official sources is slow or legally difficult. I'm not the best source on it cause I live somewhere the rules for getting on it are more relaxed but here is a link I saw a lot of people passing around when I was on twitter:

https://diyhrt.wiki/
i feel you dude. UK person here and our waiting lists are *even longer*, if you'll believe it. they *were* 3 years until you meet with a doctor, and a year or two after that to actually get surgery/T, and they've only gotten longer.

i think there's been a proposed overhaul of the children's system to reduce waiting lists, but that'll take years, and there's no way i'll be able to get any of it as a child.
In the Netherlands I‚Äôve been on the waiting list for 9 years in total, I‚Äôve just started blockers but my parents put me on the waiting list when I was 5-6
It‚Äôs not much better here in the US; it‚Äôs dependent mostly upon where you are and who your healthcare provider is. 

I‚Äôm vaguely aware you can get HRT from Planned Parenthood, or FOLX which I think is a recent project to provide HRT and some other health services for trans, nb, and gender-expansive people, but I‚Äôm unsure about pricing.
I‚Äôve heard that some places in England have wait times of over 5 yearsü´†
I am on the waiting list in the netherlands. It is also about two years at the VUMC in Amsterdam. So yea ....
Appointment: 1-2 weeks out.

Walked into appointment, told them I was trans and had been living as myself for years. Informed consent.

Took my first HRT the next afternoon, but was ready for pickup on my way home.

American Healthcare sucks.

Illinois beaurocracy sucks.

Trans rights and healthcare here is top notch.
I started hrt 9 and a half months ago at the age of 22 literally only took two months to get the appointment and meds same day. I have also changed my name and gender on every document possible including my birth certificate america is pretty great
Here in Poland there's no public trans healthcare (what a fucking surprise amirite), so had to go private. I'm very grateful all it took for me was one meeting with an endocrynologist, but the costs are a big hit to my entire family. Sometimes I wonder whether I'll get to a point where HRT prices are too high for me to continue
I'm in your boat. On the waiting list as well. Swedish as well. But, MUCH older. Sadly the whole covid situation made the list just MUCH longer, as both more people figured out that they needed help and there's less doctors.

Stockholm is 18 to 26 months wait right now. I'm about 20 months in now myself. I know that the wait just sucks. I think that the UK have much longer wait. 

But, I agree, we need the whole process be easier. To have the diagnosis part done in a quicker better way.
I feel u bro


In australia the waiting list was 1.5 years near me and i decided to do it through private doctors which cost me around 800 aud total so far but in stead of waiting 1.5 years i only had to wait 1 week for a spot in their schedule




(In australia it depends on the area and which hospital u go to to do it publically) 


I know a friend from a different state in aus who said her wait list was 3 months before she started hrt
It took one month in Romania to get access to hormones the legal way. For how little resources there are i expected it would take more. Most trans people wont be able to afford the payments for blood analysis but hrt diy is pretty cheap.


It is harder to change your name and the gender digit inside your numeric personal code, but its not impossible.


Gay marriage is still not legal :(
In Ontario, Canada (healthcare is provincial here :/ ), you don't need any real documents before you start transitioning. You can I'm theory go to your family doctor for an HRT prescription. That can be as little as two weeks after the appointment since bloodwork really should be done before starting HRT.

SRS is more involved with longer waitlists and paperwork, but at least it's free.

In practice, most family doctors won't do hrt so you've gotta find a clinic that does, a trans clinic with a waitlist of months or years, or an endocrinologist that typically requires doctors referral or has a long waitlist.
I‚Äôm Norwegian(soon 18) and I think we have the same problem here. Ive talked to 2 psychologists and can soon ask to be referred for hormones. In January, when I can ask to be referred for hormones, it will be 3 years since I first started the whole process. The wait times are insane. It takes 6 months to talk to the first psychologist. And then you have to wait 6 or more months to talk to someone else, who will then suggest that you go through a ‚Äúreal life test‚Äù (socially transition to see how it is or smt) if you would like hormones. The ‚Äúreal life test‚Äù time is min. a year. I don‚Äôt have a diagnosis but really hope I get it in the coming appointment :/
It's mind boggling how long the waiting time can get without anyone fixing the problem. The system clearly doesn't work
That's crazy, last time I heard it was a four year wait here in the UK  :/
They're definitely an option. Thank you for notifying me about them! I'll see how things progress and look more into genderGP
is it a new thing that the waiting list is that long in denmark? because i got into CKI √•lborg in months, and then it took six months for them to give me HRT
Well then... Time to start learning Portuguese
Canada has gotten so much better recently. Even out in the Maritimes, I came out in October, had several phone interviews in November and saw my dr. For the first time in December. I was able to start HRT in June, and even that was because I had underlying health issues that needed to be addressed first.
Damn really? I thought getting it that young was just a conservative scare tactic! I've never heard of anyone here starting before 18
They are starting to fix things I think but Im in the north (no where near London) and I‚Äôm in my 30s so I‚Äôm probably going to have to wait a long time
It's gotten a lot worse since the pandemic began, especially as gender affirming healthcare wasn't always classed as 'essential' and was thus de-prioritised.
Yeah I think the average is 5 years but it‚Äôs 7 where I am. It‚Äôs ridiculous, the government is currently using trans people* as some kind of villains 

*woman really. The government has some weird hang up about public toilets
GenderGP can not export T to Sweden. Only E.
I first called my GP in February to get an appointment at CKI Odense, and unless it's postponed again, I'll get the medical appointment for getting the HRT prescription in late November. Last I was told the wait for that appointment would likely be 8 months, so if this is the case, it'll have taken about 17 months to get started on HRT. And this is even despite the fact I only had 2 consultations with the psychologist, while the official minimum is 4-6.

Part of the reason seems to be underfunding. CKI Odense has funding for around 150 patients, while they are handling over 400 last I heard in June. 

Also, when I called my GP to get the appointment, I had to wait a month just for that. Could have been done in 10 minutes over the phone or by mail, but no, the system likes arbitrary obstructions.
it depends a lot, i think Aalborg is a bit better recently because a few more doctors started working there, my wait time went down by about 4 months because of that, think its taken about 6 months now with the new doctors
That's fantastic! It's funny that America getting all stupid-Republican and pushing the anti-trans stuff probably motivated people to keep up the momentum on trans care and rights. I'll take it! My trans siblings deserve way more love than they get.
Starting before 16 is almost unheard of but where live the only regulations are informed consent by the parents
The curse of TERF Island strikes again!
in my case i had three consultations with a psychologist, and then she referred me to CKI
It may have helped i was previously diagnosed with gd but idk how much of my records the clinic had access to
I had my consultations at CKI. Which is fine by me. My doctor was pretty weird about it, but the one I spoke to at CKI was really nice and informed. Just wish they had more people so the queue wasn't so long. Or, I don't know, they let people start on HRT when they are ready and not after a mandatory wall of delays.

It feels like cis people are fine with us as long as we're not successful or visible.	"There's a lot of anger I'm experiencing today that I don't know where to put.

I'm still mad about what happened to Isabel Fall. I'm angry that people doxx us the second we stand up for our own rights. I'm pissed off about every cis person suddenly becoming an endocrinologist the second a trans woman wins an event.

As long as we hide and they don't have to see us everything is fucking hunky-dory. That's how I understand it was in the eighties --- woodwork yourself into oblivion so no cis person has to experience the unbearable indignity of being in line behind a person who's obviously trans. And God help you if you're also gay, which like half of us are.

I try to understand where, precisely, the anger is coming from where something like this happens. Behind anger there usually lies fear. I think that's the key. I like science fiction. I like lifting weights. I'm trying to be fit enough to run a triathlon some day. I should not have to risk being the main character of the internet for a day for pursuing my fucking hobbies. Perhaps that's an unfounded fear. But I can't shake it from my mind. It's happened to my friends. It could be me tomorrow.

The worst part is that I have absolutely no idea what I can do about it. It just feels like this is the way the world is."	"If you feel safe and able to be visible, be visible. It's how we'll end up winning - by showing people we're just people like they are.
They hate the ones who are loud and proud. But if you go stealth they probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice that you are in ‚Äúthe wrong bathroom‚Äù.
I am looking at Lia Thomas, perfectly represents the situation you are talking about
I think some people are just lazy. They want the gold star for going through the motions and waving flags in support. They don't actually want to do anything to change anything or relate to anyone as a real person.

I'm getting all my paperwork sorted out and after wasting so much time explaining structural discrimination and discrimination to people and have it go in one ear and out the next after this is done my being trans has nothing to do with them. It's simply not going to be a talking point and they have no right to know or ask questions or get a  free education on my time. That means energy can be saved for discussing important things with people who matter and get things done.
Imagine saying all cis people are transphobic.
It‚Äôs more like cis people are fine with us as long as we‚Äôre unsuccessful, invisible, or dead.
Exactly what I'm referring to.
Where do you see the word all? Show me, I must have missed it. Or you're just completely ignoring the fucking point.
There is no all, but in the title ypu said cis, not some, just cis, if you wanted people to be able to distinguish that, you should've written some.
I'm not OP. I'm just saying OP didn't claim ""all cis people"".
I still dont know why youre trying to start fights ovet this, like what are you going to get out of this, but OP should've distinguished ""all"" from ""some""
I wasn't referring to individual cis people. I was referring to the social group in the abstract.

I also didn't claim that all cis people are anything. I said I *felt like* something. Feelings don't have to be rational.
What fucking social group were you reffering too?
Cis people? The same way that when Black people vent about white people they're not really talking about any specific white person but the sum of their experiences with white people?"	ti8lvz	trans	154	0.96	2022-03-20 00:10:01
A somewhat touchy question (maybe some unintentional transphobia, so spoilered, but in the attempt to become educated)	"Hi guys! Just a bit of a disclaimer and info first, I mean no harm in this post. At all. In fact, I'm trans masc myself.  I was raised (and am still currently live in) a very transphobic home.  I totally accept all lgbtq people, but as a result of living in such an environment I have large amounts of internalized homo- and transphobia.  I've been getting better, but I'm still working on it.  This is all just to say, please be patient with me and try to answer my question without getting mad at my ignorance.

On to the question itself.

&#x200B;

How can you tell whether a child is trans? Like how can you tell whether they aren't messing around or if they are actually trans? Like is there a way to know? Because if they **are** just fooling around and don't mean it, and yet they transition anyway, that could cause lasting problems.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading!"	"Many kids go through phases where they experiment, especially before they reach heavy socialization ages. I know a little boy who refused to wear anything but dresses for about a year and a half. He's very masculine now for a 9 year old boy, and his parents let him explore. He also had an older sister, which is where he got the interest from in the first place. If he comes out later in life as trans or gay or just more expressive, those of us who were around to witness this phase will all say, ""We saw it coming,"" but if he doesn't, it'll be seen as a normal aspect of his development.

The truth is, the concept that ""lasting problems"" occur because of this is false. Allowing kids to explore is how kids find their talents, their wants, their plans for the future. If it isn't safe in childhood, it never feels safe at all.
Transition for children consists of, pre-puberty, a new haircut and wardrobe and going by a different name. That‚Äôs all 100% reversible. As puberty begins, puberty blockers come into play ‚Äî again, totally reversible by simply stopping them, at which point natural puberty will just resume. 

Kids fooling around with something they don‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt gonna last long enough for them to get all the way through growing up enough to start hormones or get surgeries. That‚Äôs just not a thing it makes sense to worry about. Kids‚Äô fooling around lasts days to weeks, not years.

And even if somehow a cis kid messing around wound up REALLY committed to the kayfabe and got on hormones before admitting they don‚Äôt actually want to live like this forever, 1) the permanent effects of hormones aren‚Äôt instantaneous, and 2) the vast majority of the effects are reversible with some extra steps, if not just by stopping the HRT and letting natural hormones take over (eg hair removal, voice training, mastectomy).

But a cis kid hypothetically fooling around saying they‚Äôre trans for attention or whatever, if they get treated the way an actual trans kid should ideally be treated (‚Äúok, we will call you [name] and [pronouns], and you can wear whatever clothes you prefer and do as you please with your hair, and take you to the appropriate healthcare professionals at the appropriate age to begin receiving medical interventions if you want‚Äù) will just get bored with the pretense real fast.
How do you tell if a child is cis? _You_ can't. Only they can.
I don‚Äôt think anyone is going to transition unless they really want too. My daughter came out as trans at age 22. It was a surprise to me and she‚Äôd never shown any gender dysphoria before. Now she‚Äôs starting her 6th month of hormones and has transitioned socially and I see how much happier and more confident she is.
There isn‚Äôt a way to know unless they tell you. Just show that you are an ally and safe. You have to let them talk to you.
let the kid express themselves! if they messin around, it wont last very long.
The lasting problems thing, is flat untrue, unless you get surgery
I dont have much to add but thank you for working on yourself and being comfortable putting this out there looking for honest answers. I think that takes a lot.

Kids will be kids - let them have fun and learn about themselves. If theyre trans, great. If they are just expirimenting with the world around them, cool too. People grow up and change constantly
I don't know of any place where children just irreversibly transition, like with hormones and surgery and stuff. That just doesn't happen.   
In my country, they don't even give trans kids puberty blockers, and you have to go through years of evaluation to get access to hormones anyway, and that's pretty shitty.  
The thing is, there's no way to know if another person is trans other than them telling you they are. Doctors try to pretend that their gatekeeping and ""watchful waiting"" is a way to get a solid diagnosis, but it isn't, not really.   
The thing is, some people WILL regret transitioning, but those people are a small minority. It's the trans healthcare trolley problem: you got all these trans folks who are gonna be run over, but if you divert the trolley and give them access to healthcare, there's this one confused cis person who's gonna willingly jump in front of the trolley and detransition.
I‚Äôm personally of the mind set it‚Äôs much safer for a child to explore their gender and identity in general under the supervision of a trusted adult at an age where there aren‚Äôt as many lasting consequences. If a kid wants to try on a new name or a new style, sure, go for it. It will either phase out or stick, and one should treat it as an important step toward knowing themselves better. Either way, they learn something about themselves and as long as their families advocate for them and support them, there are fewer risks involved than if they were to try to transition later on without that safety net if they came to the conclusion that they are trans. 

Basically, it doesn‚Äôt matter a whole heckuva lot because it‚Äôs a learning experience one way or the other. In my eyes at least.
It all depends on the age, but ultimately, all you have to do on your end for a child who is trans is to respect them. If they are 4 or younger, they don't really have much of a sense of self. They just know words associated with them. So at that age, don't try to enforce gender roles or restrict what toys they can play with as a boy/girl. Just let them build their own interests at this point and guide them.
   
5 and up they start to develop a sense of self. (What they are, what is what, and what they like and how they feel.) So at that point, maybe they will suggest a name they like more, or start wanting different clothes. As they start figuring themselves out more, they will know more and more what they want. And if theybare trans, and have been told what that is, hopefully they can say it to you without fear. And so, guide them. Help them. Respect them.
    
If it turns out to not be how they feel as they get older, then nothing really lost. They just have more discovering to do.
Insistent, consistent, persistent declarations from the child that they ARE the opposite sex. Kids that are messing around aren‚Äôt consistent and relent when they are challenged. Trans kids typically don‚Äôt. Saying ‚ÄúI want to be a ____‚Äù once or twice is not enough to be diagnosed. Medical professionals aren‚Äôt just fucking around and treating kids for no reason. They have to present with clear symptoms to be treated.
well changjng n it would just mean legal and mrdical things which you need to have confirmed and stuff by a proffessional
This is what professionals like counselors and doctors are for. Plus nothing related to transition, especially for a child, plays out over a short enough timeframe for lasting problems to be a thing.
In my experience (as a transman) when I'd play with toys (i was like 3-5) I would say ""Well, this ones a girl, but *he's* the *king*. I think it just sounds better."" It's very specific but hopefully you get what I mean :)
The diagnostic criteria that are used to select youth for puberty blockers (persistent or intensifying gender dysphoria into Tanner stage 2 of puberty) basically select a group of trans youth that almost invariably go on to transition on affirming hormone therapy when past the age of medical consent - what this is saying is that the criteria are good enough to have already selected people for whom gender dysphoria and the need for medical transition persists into adulthood , and blockers are just a result of cautiousness.
Just offer a safe space to experiment and if they're fooling around they'll get out of it before they turn 18. Educate them on their options like different kinds of surgeries, legal name and or sex change, hormones, all previous after they're of age/legal adults, and social name change, pronoun change, and puberty blockers also before they're adults. Let them test out new names and pronouns at home and if they stick request they be used at school too for a while before making it legal. Let them choose their clothing freely wothout directing them to either gender. It's a main part of development to figure these things out, physical bodies at 2 to 6 years old and identity with ouberty at 9 to 20 years old. Teach them to be age appropriately safe with these things and they'll figure out the rest. There's no damage to social changes and puberty blockers at most make your bones a little less dense and make you grow up to be a little shorter.
[removed]
There are so many factors at play. 

I grew up in a religious home and didn't ever hear about trans people until I was 13. When I was young I would talk about my dysphoria, but my parents would say things like, ""cute game"" ""how adorable, what a funny game"" etc.
At some point I stopped talking about it (pre 7) and would be mortified if anyone mentioned those things I used to say, those ""games"" I used to play. I recall thinking to myself, ""what an idiot you were, you should have known better than to say those things out loud. Good  thing you know how to hide it now."" I was under 8 years old. 

Some kids will be insistent, but others will choose to hide that part of themselves in the name of social survival, and/or simply due to lack of knowledge. As a child, the argument that I was a girl because I was female seemed 100% irrefutable. 

I think the best way to know if a child is trans is to educate them about trans people, show that you are 100% supportive, and then wait for rhem to tell you that they are trans, thinking that maybe they are trans, are wondering if they are trans, etc.
ok! the lasting problmes thing must have been some misinformation
Not to mention afaik the only transitioning kids younger than ~15 are allowed to do is social so even if they do decide to transition/detransition the only problem would be a momentary confusion of names and pronouns. And even if hormone blockers were used and the kids decides to detransition then the only ""difficulty"" is that they start puberty later than they normally would've. Iirc actual hrt isn't allowed till about 18, by then they most likely already mostly made up their mind about how they identify. So... Yeah no lasting damage at all.
exactly.
ok, I wasnt trying to be rude, im just ignorant üòÖ
To this person‚Äôs credit, I could imagine a scenario in which a cis child socially transitioning in childhood could cause them long-lasting problems. Being treated as the wrong gender in childhood IS traumatic as hell. Luckily, because our standard for letting children socially transition is pretty high, this rarely happens.
Some would say I'm still a kid XD (I'm 18)
I will add that if the kid has received pushback, isn't taken seriously when they first express these feelings, have been bullied, or witnessed transphobia in action, they may closet themselves and lie, sticking hard to their agab gender role as a way to protect themselves. I know I did. That, unfortunately, provided ""proof"" I wasn't trans. So, it was a cycle. Out as a kid, closeted shortly after. Attempted out as a teen. Nope, still bad news. Back in the closet we go. Attempted out to the Dr I already had. Wow, that was an awful experience. Guess I'll shut up and try to find a new doctor in secret. Back to my family. These dropped hints are getting hostile reactions. Guess I'm not doing more than peeking through the crack in my closet door. I've got plenty of journals and documents to ""prove"" it to anyone now, but the method above doesn't really do anything if the person you're coming out to thinks they can be the authority over what's going on in your own head. My family had completely forgotten about previous times I expressed myself to em. It was to them unimportant and thus tossed aside.
Transgender children do exist

Brains are developed well before 21 and people know they are trans usually (tho not always) before then
Hi, MtF here 

As a kid (since 7) i was always terrified people would find out my secret, and i did everything to hide it, including getting very mad at myself whenever i ""accidently"" did something feminine.  ""I had no problem with LGBTQ but there was no way I was one"" I constantly tried to convince myself that I wasn't.  Where i grew up wasn't very accepting that way  and i didn't want to be a target.  Almost two decades later i'm finally myself, after having to repress who i was my entire lifetime and it feels amazing.  I'm finally happy and actually love myself.

Lasting problems are more likely to form from the repression of one's identity then the expression of it.  So respectfuly, i would say the lasting problems argument would actually be in favor of trans kids everytime, if only for the right of self expression and acceptance.

I still get really bad anxiety whenever i go somehwere new, worrying about what people will think and what will happen, takes me right back to school, small and scared.  Hopefully that gets better with time.

People like that are hurt, broken people. Someone made him that way, either through ignorance or cruelty. I'm not saying pity him, he doesn't deserve it, but remember that it is the light in you, the obvious happiness you experience being ***the real you*** that draws moths, like him, who have holes in themselves. You don't need anything from him, and he needs so much. Keep being you, don't let cruelty like that get to you, and hope, like I do, that one day people like him are affected in a major way and understand the harm they have done, change their ways, and strive to make the world better.
How do you know this guy? What a jerk. It sucks, he is owed a punch to the jaw but you doing it will only make things worse.
Did he follow it up by saying ""I am cornholio"" ? Pleebs...
A synchronized ""Nah"" is the response to that
If walking up to people to say things that are intentionally hurtful towards them the dude probably doesn't have much going on his life that makes him happy. He's an asshole, but a pitiable asshole. The worst kind of asshole
Honestly? if that happened to me I would probably laugh my ass off. though I have a weird sense of humor. hopefully I would be passing enough that they wouldn't even know I was trans though.

My family always deadname me and call me disrespectful when I try to correct them, what can I do?	"I am 23  and still live @ home.  I am non binary. I was born a girl and raised as one, so I am still treated as one to this day. (just a bit of context)

&#x200B;

Last year, I shared with my family that I  no longer go by my birth name. Things were ok, they were kind of accepting and whatever, though I am not quite sure they understand.

&#x200B;

Recently, they've been dead naming me a lot and when I correct them (politely), they tell me the name (my dead name) is still on my birth certificate and a name I went by for nearly 21 years, so they have a right to call me it. When I try to tell them that it shouldn't matter, they get mad at me and tell me I have ""no respect"" for them.

&#x200B;

I understand they have a hard time because I had my dead name since I was born, but it really feels like they refuse to truly try and when I try to educate them, they call me disrespectful AGAIN.

&#x200B;

I just need advice, if possible.

&#x200B;

For context: we aren't American, we're Filipino, if this matters."	"I don't really have advice, I just hope you're mindful of how they're trying to turn your argument around. You're not the disrespectful one, they are. Them turning that around and calling you disrespectful instead is a cheap trick.
Don't correct them, just stop responding to your deadname. If you want to be a little helpful and extra cheeky about it you could also start wearing a name tag or Hi My Name Is ____ sticker around them.
They are the ones lacking in respect hun
You could explain the concept of dysphoria to them and explain how it makes you feel. I had this same situation with my brother and he had no idea what dysphoria was and once I explained it to him he stopped almost immediately.
Besides not responding to your deadname, maybe you could make up new names for each of them and just always call them by those.
I don't really have great advice. You've already tried asking them, and got more or less no as an answer. I'd say at this point you could either ignore the issue entirely, or try any number of more abrasive methods. Like someone said don't respond to your dead name.

Sadly from the sounds of it you're going to deal with fire either route, so I'd pick the one you feel better about.
Ignore them completely when they use that name
I would add that - once you are ready to live on your own - that they can have a relationship with *chosen name*, if they try to have one with *deadname* they won't have one at all.
Being Filipino throws a little bit of a wrench in it, (I'm white, my best friend is Filipina tho and I know the culture fairly well and how the family structure works). It's really tough, my best advice is to just tough it out until you move out. I know not using your birth name can be seen as super disrespectful, but that doesn't mean they're right and you're wrong either. I doubt changing your name legally will make them accept you any more than they do now. I wish I had better advice but I wish you the best. Just hang in there. Try to stand firm but of course don't do anything that puts you in danger.

I mean, call them the wrong name, see how they like it
Tell them they have no respect for you, then ignore them if they use the wrong name.
You buy an air horn, a loud one, every time one of them uses your dead name or incorrect pronouns you blow the air horn. A water gun should also work. You might wanna get multiple mini horns in case they try to take it off you.
Since they‚Äôve known you by your dead name for so many years, how about giving them a time frame to use your true name all the time. Like, you all can take a week to practice and get used to my name, but please don‚Äôt use my deadname after that point.
They should respect your wishes.
You could
- not answer when they call your deadname, only your chosen name
- call them by a another name or pronouns until they get a bit right about how you feel
- pretend the person of your deadname is someone else who's gone, disappeared, and you're worried about it, but say that you (chosen name/correct pronouns) could show up instead and you're better than that person to do whatever they've mentioned you for
Idk if you have tried this before, but I would sit down and have a talk with them if possible. If they get riled up ask them why they feel this way, maybe ask them for names in the right direction if your up to it. It could be hard for them to understand that deadnaming hurts
Your identity and your body are your business and yours alone. I'd say tell them that whether or not they agree with it is irrelevant, because you're just trying to be happy with yourself and your own image. If they can't get with the program, that's on them. You have been trying to keep them in the loop and keep them informed on what you're going thru because you still love them, care about them, and are trying to be considerate towards them. If they're only going to respond by throwing it back in your face, then they're not behaving considerately, and they can respond to that info as they wish.

Much love to you and I hope you can have a peaceful resolution to this üíúüíõüíúüíõ
You're an adult with free biological autonomy, go an live independently.
Thank you. I was raised to not argue back and just shut up and listen if they're mad. But sometimes I want THEM to just learn to listen to me...you know?
oof, if I stop responding, they assume i'm not listening and then call me disrespectful again :(

&#x200B;

But i'll do the name tag thing, for sure.
That's what I plan to do when I eventually have to come out at work. They can deadname me all they want. It just makes them scum and aren't worthy of receiving help from me.
you deserve to be listened to. it‚Äôs them that‚Äôs being disrespectful, not you. you deserve to have your identity respected by your loved ones. i‚Äôm sorry that that‚Äôs happening, i hope they get better about it <3
If they're gonna call you disrespectful regardless of what you do then why should *you* be the one expending effort when it's *their* behavior that needs correcting? Think of it like the process of training a dog: you can either do negative reinforcement by constantly correcting them, or positive reinforcement by rewarding them with acknowledgement when they do the correct thing on their own.
They‚Äôre the ones being disrespectful of you.
thank you. i really appreciate this."	vqq8oy	trans	148	0.98	2022-07-03 20:25:33

i‚Äôve come out to my parents 2 years ago. today my mum has once again decided to deadname me from now on.	"I, (ftm 16) came out to my parents around 2019-2020. both are not very supportive, but they decided not kicking me out and letting me dress as i want is ‚Äòextremely supportive‚Äô. since 2020 i‚Äôve been going to therapy frequently. my therapist scheduled a group session with my parents, where we came to the conclusion to call me by my nickname, so i don‚Äôt feel so shitty every day. my parents agreed, and they‚Äôve been doing that ever since. my father has never slipped up once, he even referred to me with he/him pronouns on occasion, and its never been a problem for him. my mother on the other hand often slips up, always misgenders me and gets very mad if i correct her.

today she told me that i should stop correcting her, that she‚Äôs going to deadname me from now on because ‚Äòits too annoying for her‚Äô. my mother has never been as supportive as my father, there have often been arguments between us where she would yell at me, tell me i could never change/be a man, threatened to break the door open if i hid in my room, etc etc. for a while we haven‚Äôt had a fight that would get out of hands like that, but i‚Äôm afraid she will become like that again if i tried standing up for myself.

i don‚Äôt know what to do. i just want her to accept me, like my father does (which isn‚Äôt even that much, he does not want to call me by my preferred name nor see me as his son)

i would appreciate any advice/help"	"I don't believe she is ever going to support you with the way she's reacting, I'm sorry. Definitely something to tell your therapist about at least. I also assume you will get kicked out once you hit 18 so I would make plans to leave. Parents like her suck.
>today she told me that i should stop correcting her, that she‚Äôs going to deadname me from now on because ‚Äòits too annoying for her‚Äô.

""It's my name. How you feel about it is irrelevant. The nickname was a compromise. The alternative is (chosen name). (Deadname) is not an option. This is my boundary. I deserve to be referred to in the way I choose. Please respect it.""

If she keeps arguing, just keep repeating yourself. Be calm, and don't take bait. Don't let her guilt you, don't let her threaten you, don't let her rile you up. You are allowed to have boundaries, even with parents. You're 16, not 6.

Just keep emphasizing that this is about you. Don't let her make it about her. It's about you, and how you want to be referred to. You are allowed to tell the people you love not to call you things that you don't like. That's a very, very basic boundary.

If she yells at you, don't yell back. Be calm. If she starts hitting things or breaking things, please call an adult you trust and get away as soon as you can. Violence is not love.
Parents being ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù means driving and participating in pride events, helping out lgbt individuals and being a safe space for them, etc.

Your parents aren‚Äôt supportive. Parents really have one major goal, and that‚Äôs to love their children unconditionally. Your parents have failed this. Letting you dress how you want and not kicking you out isn‚Äôt on any scale of supportive, it‚Äôs literally the bare minimum. Imagine if you weren‚Äôt trans and they were acting this same way.

Obviously you know that your parents aren‚Äôt supportive of course, but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything against you. That‚Äôs their own fault that they‚Äôre choosing not to love their child unconditionally. It‚Äôs why the premise of found family is so important.
Try to become financially and emotionally independent. If you don‚Äôt rely on them for money or emotional support, they suddenly have way less control over your life and how you view yourself. Even though I became financially independent from 22 on I still had a lot of emotional baggage and guilt over transitioning that it took me 4 years to finally transition. Don‚Äôt be like me! Good luck
Have you talked with your father about her? From the sound of things, he seems to be more accepting. Could he help?üíõ
Ignore her. Don't speak to her if you do use male pronouns.
yeah, i‚Äôve come to that realisation. i told her i would move out as soon as possible but then she gets all sad, asking me if she really was such a bad mum, etc? she really gives me mixed signals, but i cant wait to get out of this household for sure
thank you so much! i‚Äôll try this
thank you!
its comforting to hear that this really is the case, and not just my imagination
no sadly, ive tried that before. either he pats my back saying ‚Äòits gonna be fine‚Äô or he just tells me thats the way my mum is
my mother is quite aggressive towards him too and he never defends himself or me because he knows my mother will get even more mad
She's gaslighting you. If she actually cares this wouldn't happen. Be ready to leave as soon as you are 18. This is all textbook psychological abuse and im sorry you grab r to deal with it :/
I think that's the best decision and I wish you all the best ‚ù§
You should be honest and she should be sad. She is a bad mom and she should know it, but that is not anyways practical. 

You should focus on minimizing your relationship with her and only interact as nessesary. If she wont let you stay in your room, be visibly miserable somewhere else. The goal is absolutely to make her feel bad. The goal is not to fight with her. Fighting will only make things worst. 

It can and will be hard, but as a minor, you will need to learn to ignore her attempts to trigger you. You will never win the argument. You will only incur more wrath. The only chance she will ever change is if she cares about you enough to want you around. You will not be able to talk her into accepting you. 

You may need to cut her off when you are old enough to leave.
> asking me if she really was such a bad mum

Tell her yes. Refusing to love and support her child makes her a terrible parent.
Please be safe. I had to completely cut off my parents as they refused to stop calling me names I asked them not to repeatedly--- among other reasons. 

My mom kept insisting this bizarre assertion that if you love someone, you let them do things you don't like because you love them. Like, her brother called her a name she hated, and she let him, because she loved him. She couldn't understand the crucial difference consent. She consented to that with her brother. I don't consent to it with her. 

Setting boundaries is healthy. If I was doing something a loved one hated, I'd want them to tell me, because I don't want to keep doing something that they don't like. 

I hope you can work things out with your parents. Your father sounds like he might come around some day. Your mother.... sounds like my mother. I hope I'm wrong.
oh :( i am aware that she is always gaslighting me about something, but i didnt know it included that too. thank you <3

I knew my parents were transphobic (rant)	"I feel bad for only posting rants on this sub but I haven't really had any good things to say since my egg cracked.

So today I was talking with my family about political stuff and at one point my mom said something about the media slandering Trump. To which I said ""The media is typically wrong about a lot of things but Trump is still a bad president"". I then quoted the whole definition of gender craziness that happened a bit ago to explain why I thought that.

This is when things got bad. My mom said something along the lines of trans people wanting too much and being unreasonable. She also said ""If a guy can say their a girl can I say that I'm 20?"" That's when I started to get a bit mad and the conversation pretty much just turned into a nonsensical argument. 

At one point my asshole of a step dad said ""So what? Are you not a guy?"" I ignored him and kept talking. Partially out of anger from the question and partially out of fear of being outted. Anyway as I was talking he then said. ""This must be a new thing. You probably have to hang out with teenagers to understand it.""

At that point I was so unbelievably pissed that I just left the room while politely saying ""Your God doesn't exist"". Yeah I guess that was kinda out of nowhere but I know that they're huge Christians and would get upset at that.

I was thinking of coming out to my mom recently but now I know that I probably shouldn't. I guess it's good to know for sure that I'm not safe rather than wondering if I am or not.

I've been planning to move out and leave the state without keeping contact soon and many people have told me that that's a bad idea and that I ""shouldn't do that to my family"". But now I know for sure that I'm doing it. Fuck my family.

I always knew they wouldn't support me.

TLDR; I got into an argument with my parents about Trump in which they revealed that they were transphobic. Fml"	"Damn I feel you. The shit is my I'm moved out but still financially dependent. No estrogen for me anytime soon.
family aint worth shit unless theyre actually family. dont let anyone try and tell you that you need to be available to someone just cause of blood ties
You're not ""doing that to your family.""  You're doing it for yourself.  They don't support you.  You support you.  
Family isn't blood. That's an old mentality that people use to control others. Family is the people you choose to surround yourself with, the people who have chosen to be part of your life. 

Love without empathy is just control.
[deleted]
'your god doesn't exist' will be my new catchphrase
Family always love to talk about how important ‚Äúblood‚Äù is (i.e. how important family is), but as soon as you do something they don‚Äôt like they treat you like garbage and then go into a craze when you stand up for yourself and defend yourself saying something along the lines of ‚Äúfamily is important. Never go against the family.‚Äù BITCH WHAT?!?!
Give them a chance to change, when you‚Äôre safe of course, but if they don‚Äôt then drop üëèüèª them üëèüèª

I hate when people guilt victims by sympathizing with their abusers. Do what you need to do. If you‚Äôre not hurting anyone, then live your life. You only get one
I'm in Team Fuck Yo Family, get the fuck out. Just sayin'.

Worked for me. :)
I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through this! Seeing posts like this makes me realize just how lucky I am to have a father who went on an angry ‚Äú15-minute couch rant‚Äù about the Trump administration when he found out about their plans to re-define gender.
>You probably have to hang out with teenagers to understand it.  
  
This is what being incapable of understanding the objective nature of societal changes looks like. 
>I've been planning to move out and leave the state without keeping contact soon and many people have told me that that's a bad idea and that I ""shouldn't do that to my family""

I ditched my family for having basically the same attitude. So yea, I'm totes with you. Fuck'em, leave them behind.
It‚Äôs like the old, incredibly misunderstood aphorism; ‚Äúblood is thicker than water.‚Äù

It *doesn‚Äôt* mean that birth family must take precedence over all. The full saying is ‚Äúthe blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,‚Äù and essentially means that the family we choose through mutual association of like-minded people means more than the family we were born into through blind chance.
Actually I do have Dissociative Identity Disorder (multiple personalities) and I consider them to be my real family. They've help me through a lot more than anyone else has.
Family is just random people you get stuck with for 18 years. They don't mean anything.
The only sports team I'd be willing to join.
Family goals
Yeah my step dad is really old. I honestly don't understand why he isn't dead yet considering he smokes and drinks like crazy.
It's so nice to hear people support that. Everyone I've told thought it was a bad idea. It made me start to reconsider but after this I know it's the right thing to do.
Wow that is radically different when you hear the whole phrase. Like ""great minds think alike"" is followed by ""...but fools rarely differ""
Your biological family doesn't care about you. Like all bio family, they care about what you represent to others, and what you can practically do for them. Cut them out emotionally before they hurt you more. Don't give them fuel to hurt you in the future.

People like this don't change
I feel this, headmates are great support 
I mean, I'll say the caveats of: Make sure you're fully financially independent of them when you cut them off. And that you're prepared to never have them as a fall back. But once you've gotten to that point, cut contact as much as possible, imo.
Yes indeed!

It‚Äôs nuts how these sayings that start out generally wise are distorted into people thinking they mean the exact opposite of their original intent.
You're probably right. Leaving them would only make my life better.

Is it wrong to buy Hogwarts Legacy?	"Hi there
Please consider English is not my main language, I'm not a very well-spoken person and I only fairly recently started questioning my gender so some things I say might be completely wrong and in that case, I encourage anyone to correct me :)

My opinions come from my personal experience and beliefs as an artist myself.

I believe that once I consume any type of art, let it be a book, a game or a drawing, the emotions I'll feel are mine and only mine, not of the artist anymore. When I draw something and I publish it, in a way it does become at least emotionally property of whoever sees it. It's yours to interpret. Whatever you feel when you see it it's the valid and right way to see it. I encourage you to have a different interpretation from my original idea if it reflects more your personal experience.
That's why it comes very easy for me to separate the art from the artist. When I think of Harry Potter, Rowling doesn't exist, but I remember instead the good times I had while reading the books and watching the films and how they made me feel part of something.

Harry Potter and ""the Marauders"" had a HUGE impact on my life as a child and even now that I'm an adult. Especially now that I'm exploring more the fandom side with fanfictions that are truly extraordinary and fix all the details that in Rowling's story are a little off. I deeply relate to a few of the characters, for reasons that are not very happy, but still reading about them still brings me so much joy that I really need at the moment. 

Hogwarts Legacy is the kind of game that I've been waiting for since I was a child at this point. It's exactly what I wanted and being able to play it would make me incredibly happy. Would it be selfish to want to buy it? The only problem with pirating is that it would take a bit to find and especially early on it might be a bit broken. While it might be an alternative I'd like to own a copy myself so I can play it as soon as possible without worrying about viruses and different issues when eventually they release patches, new versions and mods (like the problems I sometimes have with a specific version of Skyrim working only with a specific version of a mod I want to use)

I'll bring another example. I recently bought 2 Harry Potter themed pillows because only now that I have my own money I can treat myself with these things. Every time I see those pillows they make me happy and almost make me feel like I'm there, at Hogwarts in the common room or something. But technically I supported her by giving her a portion of the money I spent because of the logo. Does that make me awful? Does it mean that I shouldn't have bought them even if they make me happy and the pillow on its own doesn't have anything transphobic? But because I indirectly supported economically an awful person who is already extremely rich?

Me having issues with my own gender identity I should be mad. And I am don't get me wrong. I feel quite conflicted or I wouldn't have made this post. But I find it extremely exhausting to keep being angry. The franchise makes me happy and it will continue to do so. Is it so wrong?

Edit: thank you all so much for all the insights that I really needed. I wasn't aware of the plotline about stopping a slave revolt so before making any decision I'm definitely gonna wait until the game comes out to properly understand how it plays out. At this point making my own game sounds a lot less stressful

Edit 2: Okay since this post is gaining traction outside of the community if I see any comment that is in any way attacking ""the lgbt community (which I am part of btw) for being dramatic"" you will be blocked. You are not going to use MY post were I'm expressing my conflict to share hate and attack a group I'm literally part of thank you very much."	"Yes.

Death of the author isn't a thing when the author still profits off the material and uses that money to spread hate.
The issue is, that Big-Terf earns money, that she can use to fight trans people. As soon as she is dead, this might change, but as long as she is living, she can put the money you give her into the fight against us.
I was a big fan of Harry Potter when I was a young kid but now I can‚Äôt even look at it the same knowing the creator is hateful to something I cannot control. Ugh oh well‚Ä¶
I'd say yes, it is wrong to buy it, but not just for the obvious problems with J.K. Rowling. The game itself has an awful plotline where the protagonist literally stops a slave revolt (the goblins, which to make it even worse are antisemitic stereotypes).
Yes. You show support with your purchases. Buying her material is supporting her, which in turn allows her to continue to be a POS human.
i would wait a bit after the release and then try to pirate it
JKR tweeted yesterday that anyone who supports trans rights is completely ‚Äúincompatible‚Äù with owning ANY of her intellectual property whether it was bought 20 years ago or today‚Ä¶ she doesn‚Äôt want us as fans. she doesn‚Äôt even care about our money anymore she‚Äôs so prejudiced.
besides her indirectly being a terf the game is directly antisemitic and pro authoritarianism so like ya giving a terf money isn‚Äôt great but i feel like the issues with the game itself are more repulsive
People shouldn't buy anything that contributes to giving Rowling money or a platform. 

I won't condemn people and tell them they're horrible people because they did something that's bad though.
Yea it‚Äôs wrong. Just stop interacting with the Harry Potter IP until it is no longer culturally relavent she has power to kill trans people. And she has. So yeah it‚Äôs bad after Joanne terf queen dies then we can talk about Harry Potter agian
I hate JK Rowling as much as anybody else on here, but I also loved the Harry Potter universe as a child and I‚Äôm looking forward to playing the game. I play on PC so getting a second hand physical copy is out of the question, and the game will probably incorporate Denuvo DRM so a crack is also very unlikely to come out anytime soon, if ever.

If you purchase the game from steam for $60, 30% of that money goes to Valve, leaving exactly $42 for WB.
Development costs, marketing budget, and the company‚Äôs profits will all take a substantial cut from that money. How much do you think Rowling will get? I bet it‚Äôs less than a dollar per copy sold.

If you want to get the game, then I recommend making a donation to a trans rights organization, that should do more net good than not buying the game and not making the donation.

This is just my take, and I understand if you disagree. I loved Harry Potter growing up and seeing the author actively try to jeopardize the safety and well-being of my community is really sad. I wish that my existence would stop being a political issue and that my identity would be the last thing that people would think about, but it is what it is.
Do what you want, I‚Äôm not here to police the things that make people happy. But yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt buy the game. Sure, she won‚Äôt suffer financially. But as long as people keep buying her stuff, WB will continue to give her massive deals and continue allowing her to spread her hate.

Imagine if HP stopped being such a cultural staple and we *could* ignore JK Rowling. It would be nice, but as it stands she holds a lot of cultural power. As long as her words are being used in anti-trans legislation worldwide, we really shouldn‚Äôt be supporting her works
Yes, you‚Äôre giving money to the TERF queen to keep propagating her filth
People have strong opinions, and while I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose to buy anything she would profit off, it doesn‚Äôt make *you* awful. It‚Äôs kind of similar to voting, as other people have already said. Your individual contribution doesn‚Äôt mean a lot, but if everyone makes the same choice we start seeing consequences.

I don‚Äôt think anyone here is going to ease your conscious about this, unfortunately. It really is up to you whether you think a bit of support for a known transphobe is worth enjoying something you grew up with.
I will never give that woman a cent of my money.
Honestly, I'd say just buy GoW 2018. Better story, relatively same price, Kratos VA actually supports LGBTQ+ people, and also big swords go brrt.
I will not support JK Rowlings transphobia.

**She will not get a dime from me.**
Joanne K Rowling will use your own money to make your existence as close to illegal as it can be if you're trans in any way.

Will make other people's existence as close to illegal as possible if you're not.

For the only reason that she decided to hate them out of the blue.
Giving her money ! I thought the game looked great and absolutely joked for half a second about getting it and hiding it but no... just friggin no ... does she need to have a swastika tattoo and blood dripping fangs for one to grasp the seriousness of her reach and the damages done by her supporters... defund bigotry , defend each other,  define equality  . ‚úå
[deleted]
English isn't your main language, which means I would assume your birthplace is not in England or the United States. 

I am saying this for a VERY specific reason. I will answer your question with a question from me. You can answer it for yourself. 

Wherever you were born in, let's say I said ""(Place you were born in) is horrible. I will now actively exclude them from the rights they deserve."" I would never say that IRL, but this is a hypothetical. Let's say I also have a famous book series that has video games and so many merchandise and everything a fan could want and more. So much so that this is even called a world. I am not dead. I am very much alive and EVERY item sold under my company's name leads me to getting a portion of the money sold from EVERYTHING with it's name on it. 

Knowing I am an active member in excluding you from your deserved rights, would you say it's okay for your friend to support me? They say that art can be separated from the artist while asking you if it is okay to line the pockets of hate. Your friend also KNOWS I said what I said and knows that I made it a point to make things worse and worse by going more and more against the people who grew up where you did (including you). 

Would you say yes? 

Remember: as I am alive, a yes means allowing your friend to support me financially, giving me more power to hate.

Also, side note: I don't hate based on location. I don't hate based on anything but morality. This situation is all hypothetical.
If you really want to play it you should probably pirate it. Jk Rowling doesn‚Äôt deserve any of your money.
I‚Äôd wait for the reviews, because the game may be a mess at launch. It doesn‚Äôt include quidditch or any real side mini games. Seems like a pretty tailored Action adventure game rather than immersive RPG. In regards to whether supporting JK Rowling if you purchase the game, it‚Äôs up to you. Her views are trash and she is clearly led by bigotry about gender, but remember she had no real input in the game. Also, though she may receive a considerable royalty from the sales of the game, the intention of developers were to make the game for every fan not the ones she says deserves it. The main majority of sales will go to Warner Bros anyway.
its a game about antisemitism by a racist and white power writer who uses her money to directly fund alt right bullshit, it is extremely not okay to purchase this game, ignoring the trans side entierly, its STILL bad and evil to purchase and THEN ON TOP shes also a transphobe
Yes, and from what I've heard, it's not very good.

Apparently the story is about putting down a slave rebellion.
Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs complicated. Firstly, yes it‚Äôs kinda wrong. Obviously, no one should JK anymore by buying anything from here. And I would say it‚Äôs best to boycott the game. 

Here‚Äôs the problem though. Harry Potter has already become such a huge part of our cultural zeitgeist over the past decades, that this fictional world and the characters have been with some of us for the entirety of our lives, and are likely very important to a lot of people. I know that‚Äôs at least for me the case, and most people my age (and above) in my country. It‚Äôs not that easy to just delete that kind of attachment from one‚Äôs cultural identity. So I get it when it is important for some people to still entertain that, especially in an RPG video game, which is what a lot of fans have been waiting for for years.

Here‚Äôs my take for someone who feels this attached to Harry Potter: hold off on buying, just until the reviews and sales numbers of the first couple weeks are released. If it is not good or an unfinished mess (which, let‚Äôs face it, is very possible with modern AAA games), then don‚Äôt buy it. You will not have lost anything worth playing. If the sales are middling and a lot of people are also boycotting it, I also wouldn‚Äôt buy it, as your contribution would make a difference. If, however, it is the best thing since sliced bread, and millions of people have bought it within the first month, then well‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt judge you for buying it. If it is that important to you, it‚Äôll give you a whole lot and (in the grand scheme) your contribution won‚Äôt have made a big difference for an already successful game.
I just get why people just can't wait and buy them second hand. Triple A games are so expensive these days anyway.
Yeah, just pirate it if you wanna play it. r/piracy subreddit has a whole megathread of places to pirate from which is pretty simple. Plus, they update the download links for a game with the new patches and stuff up on the sites too.

The game's story is just gonna be a jackshit plot full of anti-Semitism and racism. So you're not missing out on much, but I understand the appeal of just fucking around and interacting with an open world HP game.

Personally, I'll probably pirate it if the game offers up subplots, side quests and other shit that might be decent. If not, the game just isn't worth anyone's time
As people are saying, buying this game puts money in the pocket of TERF, but you don‚Äôt exactly have to *buy* it
Yes it‚Äôs wrong
Yes it is wrong. I don‚Äôt care about your personal art philosophy. You‚Äôre giving money to an individual who WILL use it to harm others as well as the corporation who is willing to work with her, and you‚Äôre financially supporting a product that directly and indirectly supports harm to others. I‚Äôm really sorry that this is the franchise that makes you so happy, but I don‚Äôt think the joy you feel from looking at a pillow offsets the fact that you‚Äôre financially supporting people who at the very least don‚Äôt care about a group of people‚Äôs human rights, and at worst are actively working to oppress them. JK and her cronies take every purchase of Harry Potter related shit as support for their politics.

EDIT: for the record, this is coming from someone who was such a fan of HP he had to get a new set of the books because his old set was falling apart due to re-reading them so much. I LOVED the series dearly and it made me very happy. This does not change the fact that the harm its creators do (and the shitty elements in the actual material) exist and are much more serious than my fond memories.
If you have to play it pirate it.

Your money is going towards JK Rowling who is actively making trans people's lives harder and is a terf.
She just today sent hate towards a youtuber called Jessie Gender.

Buy Harry potter merch second hand, or from Etsy, where there's no money going towards JK if you want to get new merch.
Keep your old merch if you want to, but don't give any more money to JK Rowling, she's actively hurting trans people's lives.
Enough with the piracy bullshit. Don't interact with this franchise. Seriously, how hard is that for people?
Yes, the funds go to a woman who actively engages in hate including writing self insert terf books under a pseudonym that comes from an equally horrible man, but pirating I can't say is too bad...
I feel like, despite many different opinions here, buying this game does not mean you support her. Yes, it may support Rowling, but that doesnt mean you support her. I dont think its inherently wrong to get this if you really want it. I wont buy it because i dont want to give her any money, but i will not condemn others or look down upon others if they choose differently from me. i do understand Rowling is an awful piece of shit, but i also understand Harry Potter has had a massive effect of people. Do as you wish
I refer you to Jessie Gender's tweet on the matter. 

Tl;dr: it's ok to still enjoy the things you already own but buying new stuff from Joanne is funding her continued efforts to genocide us.
People are blowing this JKR thing and the plot line WAY out of proportion. Like it‚Äôs a video game!!! It‚Äôs not transphobic nor antisemitic. Get off of social media and touch grass, please. God I‚Äôm Gen Z and even I have to admit my generation is so soft. Always the virtue signaling. Always with the ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù attitude. Seek mental help and grow up.
The author in question is already rich, her making more money on the game won't do anything. And most people will buy it regardless, so a handful of missed sales from conscientious objectors won't accomplish anything

Pick your battles, this isn't something that ultimately matters
The saddest part of all of this is that I could easily write an essay talking about how trans friendly Harry Potter is, with one huge theme of the books being to accept and love people for who they are rather than who society thinks they are. Then the author had to go and ruin that.
Yes.
It kinda hurts seeing some of these reapplies- because Harry Potter was literally everything to me as a kid- and while I try to avoid things that are t fandom made or whatever to not support Rowling I do agree that pirating the stuff might be the right way to go as I feel bad having some of my old Harry Potter stuff out on display from when I was younger I wouldn‚Äôt risk viruses or breaking your device for it- do what makes you happy- tho my advice would be to be aware and try to support these ppl as little as possible without sacrificing your happiness like try to buy fandom made stuff instead of officially licensed merch where possible but if this game is something you really want I‚Äôd say go for it if there‚Äôs no other safe way to get it idk
it is wrong, no question about it. the story is said to justify the slavery in the books/films, she profits directly from the sales, the game devs have already earned all they will off of it so buying it doesnt support any decent artists.
Yes is the simple answer.

I won't fault anyone for enjoying Hogwarts Legacy as a game, art is art, you like what you like. But if you buy Hogwarts Legacy you are funnelling money into the pockets of Joanme Rowling. She has made it explicitly clear that she takes anyone paying for her merch as an endorsement of her ideals and she will use that money to hurt trans people.

No one is saying you can't enjoy Harry Potter. It was a big part of a lot of people's childhoods and it would be unreasonable to expect everyone to jettison it wholesale. However if you continue to buy licensed merchandise in whatever form, you are contributing to her ability to further marginalise trans people.

If you want to play the game, I would suggest pirating it. If you pay for it, you are in essence saying that your entertainment is more important than the safety of trans people.

Unfortunately the concept of death of the author can only be realised when the author is actually dead. There is no separating art from the artist when the artist is still around and using that art to hurt people.
I also love Harry Potter for similar reasons but the way I go about it is I buy from small businesses. This way JKR isn‚Äôt profiting and I‚Äôm also supporting small business people and I get what I want in the end
Yes, yes it is, you know better than to financially help transphobic people/companies/entities
Now be good girl and don't buy any Harry Potter products and any other products that make that transphobic author any money ok hun. We of course still love you very much and continue to be here for you. You are a good girl. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
I‚Äôm going to be honest I didn‚Äôt read all this because the only answer is Its Wrong! Buying it directly puts money in Jks pockets and she views everyone who financially supports her as a supporter of her beliefs. There is no justifying it.
It is wrong no matter how you put it when you're giving money to a TERF.

Just pirate it.
Yes. End of. 

Supporting HP in any light at this point is support for JK.
Everybody on this thread mad holier than thou, but there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Every single thing you buy for fun or are forced to buy came at the cost of the suffering of others. Don't deprive yourself of something you enjoy because you don't want to make a millionaire 75c richer. And If you're going to, don't do it because you're letting people on reddit judge your morals, do it because you think it's the right thing to do.
Honestly your happiness is more important than the moral battle because at the end of the day J. K. Rowling is making a trans person happy üíú also I bet if she knew it would really piss her off XD

One thing that would be really fantastic is if we started a trend where people were making stories and art about the all Harry Potter characters being trans and tagged her social media in the posts. It‚Äôs not possible for us to stop her from making money but we can twist her creation into some thing that she would hate üíú and honestly I feel like a lot of other people could get behind that too
Support in all forms to the artist is an act of treason upon those that the author ""hates"". You are also complicit in their hate by buying their products. There are other games, there are other movies, there will be other authors. The only way you discourage hate in a capitalistic society is by voting with your wallet. You pay them money you vote for them. You withhold money from them you vote against the hate they stand for. What's worth more? Their hate? Your ""need"" to buy a silly game from them? Or, standing up against that hate by taking away the one thing they want more than anything in the world. Your money and your approval of them by receiving that money from you. Do the right thing. Do what your heart says is right. Hate the haters. I am intolerant of intolerance. ;)
Piracy > founding the deaths of trans people.  It shouldn't be hard choice. Sometimes I feel mega corporations brainwashed the minds of consumers,  for some piracy seme.to be worse than murder lol. When in reality whichever is good of bad depends a lot in the context. Don't let megacorporation and billiomaries root your brain.
I agree it is a bad a thing to give Rowling money, however I have the same dilemma. As a queer person, there's very VERY few things from my childhood that make me feel true happiness, and one of them was Harry Potter. It seems stupid but I went through real grieve when the whole Rowling transphobia thing came out cuz I felt like this last thing I had left from my childhood had also been taken away from me. With time, my personal decision has been to keep enjoying in, privately, and only speak about it with close friends, so at least I don't give it more publicity or whatever, but I'm not willing to give away one of the few things that make me feel joy. If you feel a similar way, tbh I believe it's just fine to go and enjoy the game. The transphobe is fuckin rich already anyway, torturing ourselves into not enjoying one of the few things we like isn't gonna change it.
What's so wrong with waiting a couple weeks and pirating it?
Yes.
Yes
If they like something masculine, (sports, wood carving, etc) I recommend giving a gift like that
Yes
For legal reasons, I can‚Äôt advise you to pirate it.
ive been told that rowling‚Äôs already been given all that the game devs are going to give her. so any profits go straight to the company, not rowling. so i dont think its wrong
PIRATE IT.
Yes.  


no nice way to put it.
No it‚Äôs not wrong!  Just do what you want don‚Äôt worry about what other people ‚Äúdisapprove‚Äù of!  And I know this post is gonna get downvoted but I don‚Äôt care!! Don‚Äôt give up on things you love just because other people tell you to!
I‚Äôll start with the short answer and give my reasoning behind it. Is it wrong to buy the game? No, not at all. Yes JK Rowling has some horrendously disgusting views and is putting her billion dollar net worth towards some truly awful organizations, but Rowling has had no hand in the making of this game - asides from crafting the world twenty or so years ago. The devs of the game have been fighting to ensure that there are trans inclusive options (for example you don‚Äôt choose the characters gender, rather you choose their gender identity at the final screen and it has no bearing on your characters visual appearance) and characters, and I think it really shows. My recommendation is to decide whether or not you want to buy this game based solely on whether you would enjoy it - it‚Äôs not going to make JK‚Äôs pockets any deeper than they already are, but it will help to support the developers who want to make this series a safe place for all of us again
No. JK Rowling will have tons of money to spend on her hateful causes either way, whether or not you purchase this game is not gonna have an effect on her finances. It's not a very good game from what I hear, so that might be worth considering, but there's not really much of a moral dilemma. If you can play the game without it being ruined for you by the thought of what an asshole JK Rowling is, it's fine to buy it and play it.
I would just say wait a bit and buy it second hand. At least that way you are putting money into someone else‚Äôs pocket instead of directly into Rowling‚Äôs pocket.
Yes.

You don't have to be angry forever, but you could also choose to move on. Identifying so strongly with a media franchise isn't healthy.

You also don't have to give money to an antisemitic game in a setting made by a neoliberal transphobe.
It's a bad game made by a bad person. Don't even pirate it. There is better shit out there.
It isn't wrong at all, if you like it then you get to like it. I personally dislike Rowling for her actions, but it's not my choice to make other people not buy Harry Potter stuff. it's if they want to buy it.
Def pirate it if you can safely tho.
Just download the pirate game
I think it‚Äôs ultimately up to the individual. I think it‚Äôs fine, even though I won‚Äôt buy it, because avalanche studios is an independent, massive game company with dozens of workers and creators who made this game independent of Rowling. Unless she was directly involved (which she isn‚Äôt) or the creators also share really problematic beliefs, there‚Äôs enough of a gap between what she‚Äôs done and the creation of this game. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt support the books or the new movies as they were written by Rowling, but I support the parks and the original movies. 

I also think that she already makes so much money, that boycotting this game, even if no copies were sold, she would still be completely untouched. That‚Äôs also just hurting the creators of the game itself
I'm quite conflicted on this topic... 
I really like the harry Potter franchise and I started loving it before I knew Rowling was transphobic.

If there was a way to buy Harry Potter related things without financing Rowling I would love to do that. 
I have the same issue with FNaF products. The creator gave money to politicians that I don't agree with, but now the game has an amazing community who also creates games and stories. But that's kinda different because the creator retired so idk... 

I don't think the Harry Potter franchise is evil because the person who wrote the books is evil, but if when I buy something related to the franchise the money go to Rowling I don't think I would. 

Anyways it's kind of your choice, it's a delicate topic and you should do what you think is ok ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Buy it used, you get the game and don‚Äôt fund J K.
I'm probably getting it. The development team seems very against rowlings actions and they are working to rid the game of her hate. She doesn't have much influence at all in the development either and probably won't profit as much as people think. Even if she did she's already rich so it's not going to change her influence finance wise
just pirate it lmaoa pm if you want a link to a site where it will be on on launch day
it is morally wrong, but it‚Äôs not like you can‚Äôt buy it. i‚Äôll probably buy it anyway
I've preordered it. It was completely sold out for the PS4 so I got it for my switch. One less sale wouldn't make any difference when lots of money had already been made from it. I might have considered not buying it if other people were doing the same, but that is clearly not the case so I'm not going to deprive myself of joy when other people are happy playing it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Just fucking buy it you couldnt care less about anything related to JKR being a TERF anyways. I swear Im tired of those people tryna seem like good people for brownie points. Just be an actual ally and shut up.
I wouldn‚Äôt call it morally wrong, personally I don‚Äôt think ethics come into it strongly. Like, yeah you‚Äôre giving to this franchise‚Ä¶but like big whoop. Like, you‚Äôre just a single person, and your influence on this is zero, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel bad for the decision of the companies who made this. Because like Warner Brothers could‚Äôve decided to stop making things in this franchise, but they didn‚Äôt, because they don‚Äôt care about what Rowling says or does. What they want to do is pass on that question to you, they want you to feel bad because you see a video game that you think sounds fun, and want to play it. Because if the question becomes a personal question, that insulates them from criticism. 

The fact is this, you have zero impact on this, whether you play it or not money will be made, and if you decide not to play it the only person that impacts is you, and the only thing it does is reinforce this toxic mentality that these corporations have created which is that you should feel bad for their unethical choices. 

Basically do whatever you want, if you decide not to play it because of JKR that‚Äôs fair enough, and even though I criticized the mentality of making the choice a reflection of your own ethics‚Ä¶I also understand entirely, because I often have a hard time doing similar things where I know I have no impact, and it doesn‚Äôt matter my choice, but I still make myself feel bad, I totally understand that choice. But if you decide to buy it, do so, and don‚Äôt feel bad about the unethical decisions of other entities who legitimately had an ethical question/decision to answer here.
I don‚Äôt think that liking Harry Potter is wrong and I don‚Äôt think that the author of Harry Potter is distraught about the trans community not buying her books. I think that you buying a couple books is not going to help some tyrannical dictator nor will it spread hate more than it already has. The author of Harry Potter does not need money to spread hate. If Harry Potter books are fulfilling to you I say go getem
no, buy the game if you want
however you feel about it honestly

death of the author exists but know that jkr gets her paycheck when the deal is signed.  *she already has all the money she‚Äôll get for this.*  does buying this won‚Äôt give her money but it will signal to companies that 1 more person is interested in harry potter stuff.  no shame for supporting it and no shame for not supporting it.  do whatever you think is ok
Enjoy what u wamt to enjoy. Its ur life
Not at all. She‚Äôll still make plenty of money with or without your purchase, nothing will change for her if you do or do not buy any Harry Potter related merchandise. The only thing that changes is you and your enjoyment of life. Do whatever makes you happy, we only have 1 life. It‚Äôs not worth it to make yourself miserable over this when absolutely nothing will change if you do or do not buy the game.
Well maybe I will get in trouble for saying this but fuck it, in cases like this piracy is an option, just wait a bit and it will eventually be cracked. You can also buy a second hand of a physical copy of the game, this way you will legitimately obtain the game while not giving any money to the author or studio
Absolutely not in my opinion. Rowling had nothing to do with the development of the game. It's the same thinking as pirating AAA games because they are cooperate giants instead of indie developers. But those indie developers aspire to be in a cooperate giant role. I doubt she will make much money off of the game since all she had to do with it is the story. You are giving money to people you don't agree with every single day without knowing who they are so I don't see why this is different.
Do what makes you happy.
Just because she's a jerk doesn't mean you can't enjoy Harry Potter I hate the jerk but I still like Harry Potter
Try and find a way to pirate it. if that doesn't work then like tbh its so inconsequential that you literally might as well buy it. the amount that you would lose from not getting to play the game that's really important to you is probably more than what JK rowling would gain from you buying it so like...
Steal it if you can. I‚Äôd recommend this about any digital formatted material. Most of us are poor. Take what you can, because those that are rich steal everything not nailed down using tax laws and any other laws they can hide behind. Fuk them. And especially fuk JK. She‚Äôs a troll and a POS‚Ä¶ BTW, I‚Äôm really old. I loved the Harry Potter books and movies. Own the books own the movies. I love them and I agree with what you said about owning the personal feelings from enjoying the material. However, going forward, I wouldn‚Äôt spent one red fukn cent on anything from that cunt.
just pirate it
Yes.
Steal it lol
Join the dark side...
Yep
yes it is.
Yes. Simply yes.
The topic is a grey area, but remember, pirating is morally okay in some situations.  Either that or, like a lot of WB games, it will either come to gamepass or playstation plus at some point. You can download it without paying for it yourself. But if you are on switch or PC? Yar har fiddle dee dee, being a pirate is alright with me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: More specifically, a big corporation isn't going to ACTUALLY be hurting just because you pirate a game. The developers have already been paid. And the publisher is already deciding whether to cut them loose or keep them on for the next project. Our purchase really means nothing to them for the thousands that are going to purchase it. Probably just to spite us. Piracy is not okay when it is a small indie developer trying to share a passion project, or make their mark in the industry. WB is a big corporation making millions off of tax write offs, shady business deals, and merch sales alone for various projects. WB is a company that is morally okay to pirate from. So go nuts.
When they manage to make the game not antisemitic and you can play a trans charakter I will buy it. I dont really think I will though üò∏.
Personally I don't like to support bad people unless I'm extremely passionate about that thing, even then I tend to make less purchases when I discover that they aren't supportive or whatever the bad thing might be.
Never buy anything with that name on it. It goes right into her pocket. If you REALLY want to play it that badly, pirate it, i'm sure it will be really easy to do once its released. And if you're scared of prating it, buy it secondhand.
It‚Äôs also wrong because there is no online gaming in higwarts legacy
I heard the reasons why people dislike the game... so I pre-odered the game for 2 consoles and pre-ordered the game as a Christmas present to a friend.
It's a game.
Rowlings involvement is the basic fantasy world around it. She rich.
The actual people involved are the programmers and designers that create it.... Those include people of different background, culture and sexual orientation.
Those are the people whose job, future and family might depend on the success of the game. Those are the people you punish by boycotting it.... Not Rowling....
I honestly can't stand this destruction aggressive behaviour of the LGBQT crybabies....
It's mere attention seeking, nothing more..... On the cost of others... 
Stop your whining and grow a pair (of any genitals of your sexual preference, because you are the same as anyone else and you should be allowed to express yourself the way you want. But I honestly don't care more about your whining for attention seeking as I care about that of any cis person -> absolutely zero. And in this way, any LGBTQ person has the same value to me as a cis person)
I know this is an old post so I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll avoid the downvote mobs. 

It‚Äôs not wrong. It‚Äôs your $$ do what you want. 

It‚Äôs honestly more WRONG for other people to say what can and can‚Äôt do with YOUR OWN $$. 

You can separate the art from the artists. Don‚Äôt listen to other people.

JK is irreverent twat, and Harry Potter is much bigger than she ever will be.

Personally I pre ordered it. People fail to realize.. JK was PAID for the IP already‚Ä¶ WAY before any of her dumb tweets.. and the money she got from that deal is more that any royalties she‚Äôs getting from game sales.. so it‚Äôs moot point. 

You‚Äôre not contributing much if anything to her terf shit.. she‚Äôs already a fucking billionaire.. and will do what she wants. 

Also the terf shit she is funding.. isn‚Äôt actually effect anyone in their day to day life.. people like to get mad for the sake of getting mad. 

So do what you want, buy the game, play the game, make videos on the game steam the game. 

Don‚Äôt over think it and enjoy your life, don‚Äôt let other people tell you what you can and cannot do with your own cash
First world problems.
This. If you can pirate it, fine, whatever. If you bought it already before you learned, well, the money‚Äôs spent, may as well enjoy it if you still want to. But spending more money in ways that enrich aggressive bigots who actively fund hate groups in trying to get bigoted laws passed is actively contributing to that bigoted effort whether that‚Äôs your motive or not. 

Put it this way, if someone were selling chocolate as a fundraiser to build a puppy-kicking machine, being very open about their desire to kick puppies more efficiently and make sure no puppy remains unkicked, would it be ok to buy their fundraiser chocolate just because you like chocolate a bunch?

Find another form of entertainment. There‚Äôs plenty of chocolate that doesn‚Äôt fund a puppy-kicking machine.
Probably not even after she dies to be honest. A lot of big money people set up foundations and the sale from their art form after their death goes to the foundation that will then use that in whatever way the person wanted. I can't honestly see her not doing this. She's in the process right now of setting up a women's thing (I can't remember what it was for) and its for cis women only.
I wish people would talk about this aspect more. It‚Äôs not only giving her your money, but also choosing to ignore all of the other racism, antisemitism and more within the books and this game. Her world is not fun despite her being transphobic, it‚Äôs poorly written with bigotry in every chapter.

Edited to add: I just think it shows people have no backbone to support their own supposed morals. Sure a single person purchasing the game wont do much, but everyone claiming that THEY are the exception and it isn‚Äôt a big deal means a shitton of people are excusing themselves cuz ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just one person‚Äù. So a shitton of people are purchasing the game giving this woman money.
This is a bit of a misconception, and an assumption.

We don't know what the character is going to do with the goblin rebellion, and we don't know how it'll play out. We don't know if the main character will start out with the typical anti-human sentiments that were likely common at the time, but they then transition into being sympathetic to the goblin cause. We don't know if the goblins will be attacking students and civilians, requiring the main character to respond in defense, rather than to suppress the revolt.

Not to mention there are similar concepts in plenty of other IP. Skyrim, for one. Do you fight for the stormcloaks that discriminate against elves? Or do you fight for the Empire, which is falling apart from within?

Second, the claims that the portrayal of goblins is anti-Semitic has been disproven a few times.

Goblins in Harry Potter are portrayed pretty well in line with European fairy tales about Goblins, which predate anti-Semitic tropes. The similarities are coincidental, rather than intentional.

Suffice it to say, we don't know how the goblin revolts will play out, and the claims of anti-Semitism have been disproven.
There‚Äôs a pretty good thread about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/x0n0fn/even_if_the_transphobia_doesnt_bother_you_please/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from r/WitchesVsPatriarchy
We don‚Äôt know anything about the plot besides the tagline ‚Äúpossible goblin rebellion‚Äù and that the major mystery will be ancient magic. It‚Äôs too early to know exactly what route the story will follow
I thought the house elves were slaves and the goblins were she who shall not be named's beliefs in Nazi propaganda of Jewish bankers made in the Wizarding world?

Either way she's absolutely disgusting so I guess it doesn't matter.
Yet we kill countless innocent people in games and don't blink an eye.. Lol
It's fiction, the goblins are not stand ins for Jewish people, it's in the Wizarding World, so it's from the perspective of fictional magic people in a fictional world, also we gotta remember that this is just stuff that is established in the Wizarding universe, it's no different than any other horrible thing established in any other universe.
Yes! STEAL IT!!!
Be gay. Do crime.
This is the best answer lol
So basically you do seperate the art from the artist. But you just want to steal. If you pirate you have the same views as her. Because it is a world made from her ip so indirectly from her mind. So you do agree with her than
Wow, what a moronic bitch. Even the actors themselves (and almost all fans) disagree with her, and it‚Äôs honestly just as much of not more theirs than hers. Fuck her. It‚Äôs not even her call to make on who is ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to enjoy the HP universe and story. Egotistical as fuck.
indirectly? she literally just tweeted ‚Äúmerry terfmas‚Äù and has been VERY clear that she has transphobic beliefs *and is proud of it.* iirc she‚Äôs also donated to anti-trans organizations. i‚Äôd say she‚Äôs a terf very directly

sorry if this comes off as aggressive, i promise it‚Äôs not targeted at you. jkr just makes me so mad and it sucks cuz i really like harry potter
Directly anti-Semitic and pro-authoritarian?

First the claims that the portrayal of goblins is anti-Semetic have been disproven. Second we have no idea how the story line will play out with the goblin revolt. We know there will be choices in-game related to the plot. It's very possible the player character is able to develop sympathy for the goblins and doesn't take part in any sort of suppression.

Even if they do, who cares? It's art. There are portrayals of slaves in media all the time.
Absolutely agree with you there. Boycotting sounds good and all, but it doesn‚Äôt actually help people who are actively struggling. It certainly won‚Äôt stop religious organizations in the US from funding anti-LGBTQ politicians and their rhetoric
This thread makes me sad because there's a lot of judgment being thrown at anyone that would consider buying this game. Like it sucks that money is going to someone like Joanne, but placing individual responsibility on any single person isn't fair or realistic. No ethical consumption under capitalism, y'know? Should people be shamed for buying factory farmed meat? Produce from farms that exploit undocumented workers? Cars that add to pollution? Consumable items with plastic packaging? Getting services at a for-profit hospital or clinic? All of these things are bad but it's not any one consumer's fault. And if you're not going to flame someone for all these other things but you would for buying this game, where's the morality in that? Transphobia is fucking awful but it's a hard sell that it's any more worth starting fights over than pollution, animal cruelty, labor exploitation, healthcare inequality, etc. And it wouldn't be worth being a toxic asshole to people over indirectly supporting those things either, because they individually have no power over those things, just as we have no power over Joanne's transphobia.
Exactly this. There is such a thing as separating the art from the artist. Unfortunately that has had to happen alot lately. The story itself has all been about love and accepting people for who they are. It does suck that she is going to profit from the game due to her owning the IP. Though thankfully had no involvement on the story itself outside of keeping the lore intact... Dont want another cursed child incident. Truthfully I agree it should be a choice. And whether or not you play the game shouldnt decide whether or not your a transphob that some people may claim you to be..   


I know some trans people that are excited for the game and obviously despise and are hurt over JK for her words against the trans community. Hopefully the recent talks from WB is true and they plan on trying to get her to sell it completely to them. Because they want to make new movies... but not with her in the picture.
PIRATE TIME BA-BY
You cant blame people for liking the franchise, i have friends who are going to buy it and i dont chastise them for it. We all know the creator is trash but im not going to let that drive a wedge between me and my friends that support me. This is where piracy works perfectly less money goes to the terf and people get to enjoy the content. 

It‚Äôs a crappy situation but we should try and make the best of it. At the end of the day every sane person knows is trash. The only thing we accomplish by trying to force our friends away from the franchise is making ourselves seem overbearing.

This is silly. Of couse there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. But its also important to do things that don't directly have an affect on you as a person. Morals vs ethics.
Thank you!!! Can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll this far to find a reasonable take lol
i think you‚Äôre a little naive, she would not be pissed that harry potter made a trans person happy, she‚Äôs be laughing knowing that she‚Äôs getting money from a trans person. money that will go straight into the pockets of other people trying to kill trans people.
What a sweet answer and I agree!
Treason is going a bit far, that kind if rhetoric only alienates people that are on the fence. Also this isnt some random brand its pretty ingrained in alot of peoples childhood. 

I know it sucks that the author of a prolific franchise hates us, but if every trans person got into arguments with their friends about this we would all seem pretty unhinged. Everyone knows the creator is trash and honestly I don‚Äôt know if trans people are even a big enough group to make a dent in the revenue.

once that thing people love starts directly harming me or other people i hold dearly, i think i have a legitimate right to be peeved about it and try and stop them from doing it.
Agreeeeeeeeeeed :3
Joanne wasn't even involved in the making of this game lmao.
the whole mentality of ""it's just one sale"" is bullshit. once everyone starts thinking that it's not just one sale is it?

you framed it in a way that makes it seem not that bad, that means more people are probably gonna buy it just because ""it's only one sale"".
Okay but...they only keep making it because it make money. If it doesn't make enough money because people stop buying it, especially if they have a cited reason of ""Rowling's hate speech"" then yeah, they might question the ethics of working with her.
I think that‚Äôs something you have to decide.   Personally I will not buy it.  I used to love Harry Potter and still do.  I haven‚Äôt seen, bought, or even viewed any HP on tv which was hard because I used to always watch it.  That‚Äôs just me though.   I know she had little say over this project but she still gets paid because it‚Äôs her IP.   We all have to personally decide where the line is.
JK‚Äôs net worth is in the billions. Whether or not this game sells will have no perceived impact on her financially. Pirating the game would only hurt the development team who have been fighting add trans inclusive options such as in the character development. I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but let‚Äôs be honest she probably makes more in a day from the deal with universal studios amusement park than this game will generate in a 5 year span
What if someone back in the day with a huge pile of money set up a foundation to spread pro slavery propaganda or something else that is unethical? Would we still see campaigns of pro slavery today from it or would there have been interventions? Assuming the money doesn't run out.
Well, we know the villain is a goblin named Ranrok that incited a goblin rebellion in Harry Potter history. Even if the conflict isn't blatantly ""stopping a slave revolt,"" they still have the antisemitic caricature as the main antagonist.
Crimes are ok if they are against people you don't like?
i most definitely do not share her views or agree with her- i have no interest in the game and have no idea what the game is about other than harry potter. the truth is people want the game. for whatever reason that may be; it could be playing with a friend, nostalgic attachment to harry potter, general interest in video games i have no idea. i‚Äôve never pirated a game before- but if you have such a strong desire to get a game despite it being made by someone who has terrible views, then pirating is pretty much the best way to do that as it doesn‚Äôt directly/financially support the creator. otherwise i mean- just don‚Äôt get the game, right?
""almost all fans""  
Hmmmm, not really. Actually those who hate JK Rowling are a tiny minority. Hogwarts Legacy isn't even out yet and it's the best selling game on Steam in a long time.
no lol i worded that very poorly. she is a HUGE terf, it‚Äôs just that her terfiness isn‚Äôt directly manifested in the game, and purchasing and playing the game only indirectly validates it, vs engaging with the game itself validating her antisemitism
Yeah, she seems pretty unrepentant and proud of her shitty views. Also she pals around with other TERFs who pal around with fascists (neo-nazis, white identitarians, christian fascists, etc.) and has shown support for these views which are not only anti-trans, but are also anti-queer in general, and also misogynistic, racist, xenophobic, and antisemitic. Basically if you support any human rights cause JKR should raise an eyebrow for the company she keeps.

And before anyone comes at me and says you aren't responsible for who your friends and associates associate with, do you have any friends who are close buddies with avowed fascists? I'm gonna guess not cause it's a pretty hard lapse in judgement to look past.
I feel like which artists we choose to support is a different conundrum than many of the other examples you mention. We all have to eat and all affordable food comes with baggage. And yea, we all need entertainment, but if we‚Äôre going to use our money and voice and time to enjoy an artist‚Äôs work I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so bad to prefer an artist who is enjoyable rather than one who wants us dead. There‚Äôs tons of authors and game makers. Tons of less awful people that would love to have 1% of notorious terf Jk rowlings influence and appreciation. Anyway yeah I don‚Äôt try to shame anyone either but I do try to avoid giving help and support to the most outspoken of transphobic voices
I have beef with the way OP came here just to gaslight us how Hogwarts Legacy situation isnt that bad. IN A TRANS SUB. When the author uses her power to belittle us.

That being said i agree with you. Its like the ""brush your teeth with a cup of water"" to save the planet. Effective step but then you have factories doing more damage in a hour than your whole lifetime. Who gives a shit someone pays 50$ for her game when actors could have made a statement by refusing to participate in her movies or studios not working with her on behalf of her transphobia. 

The sad truth is little can affect her. Shes rich, she has influence, she could get 0 money till her death and still live well.
Thank you for being the only sane person on this
I don't have to imagine it. Harry Potter was the driving force behind me not only learning to read but developing a love for fantasy. That's the hobby I'll be continuing.
you seem to forget that just about every trans person more than likely spent their entire childhood (and often more) as a gender different from how we identify now. part of transitioning is leaving that behind. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm invested in this‚Äù is not an excuse to continue supporting someone who is actively working to kill us. i do not understand how anybody would want to uplift a franchise that a) is already extremely problematic in itself, being riddled with antisemitism & classism, and b) was created by an awful trans-hating cunt.
Actually it is pretty easy to cut off childhood media franchises. You can just find something else. Attaching yourself to media that way is unhealthy and uncritical.

The thing is that most hobbies aren't harmful. Nobody who knits is going to be told they should stop because of moral complications.

But stories? There are millions of stories. If a story sucks, you can just find a new one.
I'm a black disabled queer trans person. There is no item I could buy that wouldn't directly victimize me or someone else. There is no item anyone could buy. Why do you only care about morals when the group you belong to is involved? You gonna stop eating bananas because Chiquita uses slave labor or nah? Also, I'm poor. Telling people their morals aren't in tact for buying things that hurt people when I can't afford to buy things that don't hurt people means I should just.. die? This isn't about just a game it's about everything. Imma stay silly, thanks.
Look at the end of the day the terf is never going to be successfully boycotted and she has more money than she knows what to do with(800 mil). The only thing I could see getting her deplatformed is if she went all kanye and attacked jewish people.

If harry potter merch makes OP happy then thats what matters most. The worst thing we can do as a community is drive a wedge between trans Harry Potter fans and the rest of the community. We are already a somewhat isolated group and I don‚Äôt want to see people get more isolated just because they like Harry Potter.
well it's turning your back on them is I guess what I wanted to say. it was a flow of consciousness and the correct word failed me at that moment and I unfortunately used one that has a trigger effect for many. Was a bit harsh. For this I do apologize. I don't edit, I should. Every penny counts ask any accountant. Can't have a dollar without a penny. Use the money for good, contribute it to fight the hate instead of fueling the demons of hate. Do you really need more stuff? Can't you borrow it from someone or buy a used one in a few months off ebay? Steal it? Boycotts work if you work them. Get supporters on board. Go make yourself heard like it's Stonewall. I don't like nor care for the whole genre, so no love lost here for JK to begin with, but I get people have a sentimental attachment to it and that is hard to let go of. That's the part that hurts. Like lost innocence.
If a horrible person writes a book, I don't buy it. If Hitler wrote a book say, and called it ""My Struggle"" about how he had to struggle to survive as a educated white person in a educated white person dominated world, and he put the blame on his failures on poc, the disabled, lgbtqia and any other marginalized communities that are easy to make scapegoats, and encouraged others to denigrate and belittle those communities, I'd be not at all willing to pay money to read it. I can't help it if joe corporate cheats on his wife and is mean to dogs. So I might buy his brand of shoe. Totally different things here. Apples meet oranges.
It's different when it's a cultural product that reflects the worldview of the creator. Utility products don't have that kind of baggage.

For example, if I heard a movie director was racist, I would indeed stop watching their movies.
Well it‚Äôs not about you!  You‚Äôre free to boycott something you‚Äôre against but it‚Äôs not fair for you to make someone else stop.  And it‚Äôs not directly harming you.  If ANYTHING, it‚Äôs indirect.
I agree it's not a great mentality but when a majority of people are thinking like this, it's kind of impossible to do anything about it.
I'm sure there's even some people buying this game who aren't even aware of how shitty JK Rowling is. They're just there to play the game and that's it. I doubt any reasonable consumer genuinely wants to support someone like JK. 

I think about this mentality from time to time and it can be applied to alot of things. For example, recycling. It's pretty good for the environment.
If I do my part, that's great. But recycling only really seems effective when everyone takes part. Is everyone taking part in it? No. But I'm not going to use that as my reasoning to NOT recycle.

I know comparing a game to something like recycling may seem silly but they are similar mentalities
You‚Äôre not wrong, but like‚Ä¶that‚Äôs never going to happen. Because like even if people decide to take a principled stance against this, which is fair enough there are still countless who either don‚Äôt know, or either are actively onboard with JKR. And that is fundamentally the issue at play here. Even if OP doesn‚Äôt buy the game they will be outweighed (most likely) by those who do, because it doesn‚Äôt matter what JKR says or does to them. Therefore, they will never face that ethical question, because either it won‚Äôt get to that point or if it does they may still disregard that, and argue that it is a fluke. My point fundamentally is that companies have no ethics, they will fuck over anybody and everybody for a dollar, and when they do they will foot the blame to the consumer such as OP.
If people are asking for opinions on whether or not it‚Äôs ok to buy it, I‚Äôm gonna give mine. I can‚Äôt actually prevent you from buying a game just because I think it‚Äôs morally wrong to do so.
That's not how development works. The developers have been paid what they are going to be paid. They do not get extra money based on sales numbers.

And by the way, the lead designer on Hogwarts Legacy is a massive misogynist and vocal supporter of gamer gate, the social movement that has bullied more than one female developer to suicide.
What on earth are you talking about, get out of here with that disingenuous nonsense.
The only intervention that happens in that case is when the thing being supported becomes illegal. A pro Slavery campaign would cease because Slavery is illegal. Places like the UK and America can't even seem to legislate hate crimes against black people or women to be illegal (or at least enforceably so) so the chances that discrimination against trans people because illegal enough that her estate can't support it anymore is very unlikely. By the time it happens, HP will be a distant memory.
That's not what I was saying, but I'll play your game.
Then the people who feed more money into this person by buying their products would be funding even more people to get hurt than would have if people stop funding this moron. It may stop eventually but the collateral damage of people who are hurt by this rhetoric will be higher.

What I was saying was referencing the the previous comment or saying it would be ok to buy her crap once she's dead because then she can't continue her tirade against trans people. She absolutely can continue her tirade if she sets up a foundation to do so.
I believe the goblins in the series are based off the folklore creatures from the Middle Ages mixed with dwarves from fantasy series like the Lord of the Rings, rather than the antisemitic caricature made to compare Jews to monsters and demons. Truly is disgusting what depths people have gone and will go to harm others
I don‚Äôt condone people buying the game, but I have to say I don‚Äôt think the majority of those buyers necessarily like her or support her views. They‚Äôre supporting her monetarily, which as I said I don‚Äôt condone, but I wouldn‚Äôt jump to the conclusion that the game sales is indicative of people who love or respect JK. I‚Äôve been in the HP fandom and spaces for years and transphobia seems pretty staunchly opposite to what the majority of them like and stand for, a lot of them even being LGBT themselves, like myself. But I understand I‚Äôve only seen a tiny fraction. I think what you‚Äôll see a lot of people saying is that they don‚Äôt feel like buying the game is directly supporting her, and more so supporting the game studio, etc. Or that there‚Äôs no ethical consumption under capitalism, or they don‚Äôt feel like them specifically refraining from doing something they‚Äôll enjoy (playing a long awaited game) is going to have much of an affect on an already FILTHY RICH terf. I still don‚Äôt agree with buying it, but I think that‚Äôs what most people might say when you ask why they‚Äôll buy a game that‚Äôs connected to someone so hateful.
Right, it's not a perfect 1:1. But still, the overall point remains the same, that people can be super needlessly toxic about this kind of stuff. People are acting like anyone that buys the game is a traitor who hates trans people and that $60 is a game-changer in spreading or stopping transphobia. I don't plan on buying the game and spending money on things tied to explicitly bigoted people doesn't sit right with me either, but all the in-fighting and ""no true Scotsman"" bullshit has got to go.
I'm so sorry if it came out that way. I definetly think it's a big deal or I wouldn't have asked. I know first hand how damaging her influence is. I thought this was the right sub since I wanted an opinion from people who are trans and not from some random people who are not affected by it. Could you please quote where it seems that way so I can edit it? Again I'm so sorry I really didn't mean to and if I sounded disrespectful in any way I would like to know
They probably don‚Äôt mean to gaslight, and are feeling conflicted about liking something created by a controversial author. That‚Äôs why they bothered making this post.

A lot of people who like Harry Potter don‚Äôt connect it with the author at all. I prefer fanfiction, so it‚Äôs easy for me to not support her while still enjoying it. But she still has the rights to it, so official products fund her on some level and I try to avoid that. My point is, the world of Harry Potter is almost completely separated from the author. You can appreciate it without supporting her. Actors in the movies disavow her, and substantial parts of the fandom does too. 

OP is struggling to decide how they feel and how they want to approach this, and are telling us how they‚Äôve self-justified it. That‚Äôs not really gaslighting. 

And I think boycotting her product can have an affect. If everything related to her barely sells, her reputation suffers, and she‚Äôll struggle to find companies to partner with. It‚Äôs obviously not perfect, but it does something.
You‚Äôre using the term ‚Äúgaslight‚Äù incorrectly. What you‚Äôre calling gaslighting is someone presenting a view different than yours, that you find offensive. 

Gaslighting is when one person directly attempts to alter another person‚Äôs perception of truth or reality, with intention, on purpose. 

You can 100% disagree with their take, but this is not gaslighting.
[deleted]
Give me a break. That's reaching. You're equating life to just not support a video game because it's creator is a transphobe. The multitudes in which those two things are diffent are HUGE.
this is the worst mindset to have. ‚Äúit‚Äôll never happen so why not keep supporting her‚Äù is exactly the reason it will never happen
>Well it‚Äôs not about you! 

no, it's not about me, it's about the fact you and others are content with supporting a terf just to play a game. i know everyone's willing to abandon their morals for convenience or fun every now and then, but this is still annoying and i have a right to be annoyed. 

sure, it's not directly harming me, but that support given is still a bad thing that can and most likely will impact people whether you like it or not. just because something isn't impacting me specifically, doesn't mean i can't be mad about it.

and even then, indirect harm is STILL HARM.
>I know comparing a game to something like recycling may seem silly but they are similar mentalities

no i absolutely understand it

i just wish i could *make* people be better with this sorta stuff. it can be so infuriating
But at the same time, companies don't want most of the money, they're only Happy if they get ALL of the money. If a game doesn't meet expected targets, either from slightly less sales, reviews, etc then they'll be less inclined to produce more. It's already happened to their mobile games. The HP franchise is a behemoth on weak legs; it's creator is controversial, it's newest properties have been very weak and underperforming, and people are starting to see the commercialization of it the way star wars got when Disney took over. This game doesn't need to fail, it just needs to not succeed flawlessly for it to be a big hit against Rowling and WB. Companies aren't unstoppable. Voting with your wallet does work. Especially in the gaming sphere.
You didn‚Äôt . Whatsoever . You asked a question. Anyone who makes you feel bad is the problem NOT YOU . AT ALL
Laugh it off honestly
You‚Äôre not gaslighting anyone, you‚Äôve been respectful and asked a genuine question. Don‚Äôt fret over it
yeah but also looking at hp from a contemporary lens it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fucking awful. it‚Äôs incredibly fatphobic and antisemitic, the transphobic snipes about rita skeeter are thinly veiled, and hermione was laughed at for trying to abolish elf slavery (which of course, they *liked*). plus harry sees all this shit happen with the ministry of magic and decides to be a cop anyway. like‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm sorry, op & commenter. i really am. i am nonbinary and have a hp tattoo (that i now despise) from before the terf shit came out. but knowing what we know now i don‚Äôt understand how some of y‚Äôall feel okay with continuing to engage with this fandom. read another book! try rick riordan!
Who said anything about easy? Doing the right thing only when it doesn't impact you is easy. Interacting with this franchise directly contributes to JK's social, political, and yes monetary power. People are being asked to look critically at their contribution to that. And for many, that's too much to ask. Arguments like this, may make that more palatable, but no less problematic. At the end of the day, folks will do as their conscience dictates.
I'm saying my opinion applies to both situations. This convo is no longer about video games, apparently now its about ethical/moral consumption. I've shared my opinion and if you don't like it that's okay. If you haven't already, You will probably never have to experience something that would force that opinion upon you and I'm grateful for that. But I hope you stick to your own morals and stop shopping at every company that does business with/supports chik-fil-a. It's a long list. If you truly believe this, you'll Google it and make a long list of all the places you can't shop. If you believe in your own opinion that is.
I mean personally i dont buy any harry potter merch, but im not going to bash someone who enjoys it. Also J. K. Rowling is 57 years old lets say she lives till 90 god forbid, her net worth is currently 800 million dollars. She could blow 24 million dollars a year for the next 33 years. So yeah she is set for life at this point even if harry potter died off today. So yes boycotting at this point is pointless. 

And the most important thing we can do is stand together and support each other as a community. If we let stupid shit like who likes Harry Potter divide us then that‚Äôs only hurting us. There are literally people in the thread saying anyone who buys Harry Potter merch is a traitor. That‚Äôs not OK, that‚Äôs the opposite of supporting each other.
‚ÄúVoting with your wallet‚Äù is meaningless nonsense. Either you will be outvoted, or you will end up voting for someone who‚Äôs a more covert evil than the original evil. The effect of one individual or even 1000 individuals is overall in the grand scheme of things irrelevant.
That's a lot of speculation on your part.
the opposite of supporting each other is giving money to the people trying to kill us, not saying ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs okay that you‚Äôre giving money to people trying to kill us‚Äù
People like you are the reason we end up with shitty politicians because instead of using your vote you just whine and say ""whaaaa, voting doesn't matter!"" 
Quit being a pessimist. In this case ""voting"" Is literally ""do nothing"". Maybe OP can take a lesson in that from you.
And not enough on yours. You've only considered yourself. Maybe you should step into someone else's shoes for a moment and research/think about how hard it actually is to live in a way that *you* think is moral. Have a good day ‚òÜ
So you really just want to be mad at something even if it‚Äôs at the cost of some trans people. The world isnt black and white, there are gray areas. 

There is literally nothing you or anyone can possibly do to stop J. K. Rowling from donating to those shitty groups. She already has hundreds of millions of dollars. That fight is lost, it sucks but that‚Äôs life, Life sucks sometimes. 

If you want to not give J. K. Rowling your money that‚Äôs fine. But don‚Äôt give other people shit for enjoying Harry Potter. Because half the clothes in your closet were probably made by underage sweatshop workers that you supported. Fast food, thats made by criminally underpaid workers desperately trying to make rent. Bottled water is produced by companies who are stealing water from communities. You can‚Äôt throw a stone in this world without hitting A company or a person that takes advantage of people or has shitty beliefs. 

The one thing we can do, and it‚Äôs by far the most important thing, is stop the trying to make our fellow trans people feel bad about buying something as simple as a Harry Potter pillow.
Ok serious question for you‚Ä¶what sparked this change in topic? Like, nothing we previously were talking had to do with actual voting, like why pivot the conversation? As to the other things you say you‚Äôre correct, I believe that voting doesn‚Äôt matter. I fundamentally don‚Äôt believe that change can come from the ballot box, I don‚Äôt see that as being pessimistic though, I do believe change can and will come as that it is the eventual nature of things (although it‚Äôs not so linear as things just automatically change for the better, you have to work for that) I am optimistic in this belief. 

But again this comes back to the fundamental debate that exists within this conversation, your belief that the actions of an individual whether that‚Äôs OP buying Hogwarts Legacy, or my opposition to voting, has a fundamental impact, which is contrast to my belief that neither OP buying the game or me not voting has a fundamental impact because there are structures that exist outside of the action or inaction of the individual that impair that action from having any real impact. Fundamentally speaking, I have no impact on what politicians are elected or what policies they pursue, because I could vote in every single election for a candidate who best reflects my beliefs, but one of the following will occur: A. Not win because of money which stands in opposition to their election (I.e. Jeremy Corbyn is the best example I can think of), B. Win but not have the power to make any change because of the structures which exist outside of themselves, C. Win and become part of the structure they may have wished to change, and thus wish to maintain that structure (B&C is any so called ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù or ‚Äúdemocratic socialist‚Äù within like the US), D. Win and then be removed by that structure outside of themselves (I.e. Salvador Allende).
Lol what do i have to research or think about? I'm literally talking about making a personal decision not to support someone who has a hatred for who i am/most people are here. Talking about the ethics of living in capitalism is a larger issue. That's not the conversation we are having here. 

I am all for debating/talking about that and i understand it's difficult to make decisions when you're not financially equipped to do so. I do. I've lived my whole life that way. But honestly there's no connection between what you're talking about here. Moral and ethical aren't the same thing.
your viewpoint is so twisted. nobody is going to die if they can‚Äôt buy Harry Potter Hogwarts Legacy. buying Harry Potter Hogwarts Legacy, however, can *and will* aid in the harm of trans people. Yes, i absolutely will give shit to any person, trans or not, for giving money to people who are a direct danger to the trans community. 

not everything is black & white, but this subject absolutely is. i have no interest in responding to you further as you clearly care more about your precious little harry potter than the lives and wellbeing of the people in this community.
Don‚Äôt waste your time on that child
This right here is literally the wedge driving I was talking about. I don‚Äôt even own anything Harry Potter related. 

The only thing I care about is not alienating other trans people. I‚Äôm not gonna get mad at a trans person for buying the stupid game. Because when you do that you‚Äôre the one causing the problem with that one person. You‚Äôre pushing them away because of something stupid. And now they have one less friend or community member to lean on. All because you want to be self righteous.
Just because it‚Äôs black and white to you doesn‚Äôt make the situation any less nuanced. Universal Studios has an entire section of a theme park for the Harry Potter IP, which likely generates more revenue in a day than this game could possible hope to make in 5 years. There isn‚Äôt an ethical way to consume in today‚Äôs capitalistic climate, so my recommendation to all is that if they must purchase or engage in said media, then match their money or time and direct it to organizations that support the communities that would be hurt"	zp0rci	trans	138	0.85	2022-12-18 15:12:58
Found out my GP could have prescribed estrogen this whole time and the 2 year waiting list was bullshit.	yes I did the blood and sperm test, got the therapist note all the needed stuff, I am very mad RN.	"...sperm test? Is that a thing in the UK?
(Saw from other comment you're in Australia) Same. I'd been on the waiting list for an appointment with the gender clinic in Brisbane for a year, and then at that appointment they tell me I can get it prescribed from a GP! FFS, why don't they make that more clear! I mean, I guess its good that it's much easier to get than we thought bur still, really annoying.
Seriously 2 years. The US has screwed up health care but I'm pretty happy I can just spend money and get hormones. It's the no wonder Abigale said people die waiting.
Edit UK similar wait times to Australia
That‚Äôs ridiculous. I would be pissed off too
Thats some horseshit.
Sorry this has happened to you. It‚Äôs atrocious. Fellow Aussie
Yes I think u should.fine another gp then girlfriend
It‚Äôsa real I‚Äôm in Indiana in the US. The requirements here are HRT letter from a therapist diagnosing you with Gender Dysphoria after a minimum 4 sessions they also have to specialize in gender identity, get a general practitioner (GP) That is pro trans/lgbt+ that is not a cis-man because nearly all have cases of malpractice pending against transfolx of color. Your therapist has to mail your gp letter to your gp. Your gp decides to write off on you to see an endocrinologist(it will be a long list but you should call and get on the cancellation list) the endocrinologist determines weather or not it safe for endocrinologist to issue an hrt plan they also can sign gender marker reassignment with or without you having to be required
Yo wtf sperm test? Why would they need to know that??
Australia.
Abigail Thorn, I presume?
Yeah I can't afford to go to the doctor for most things but estrogen was fairly easy to get.
yea I found another GP lets hope I can get the pills this time
Nut in the jar to prove your womanhood!
Im not sure why, but Im from Brazil and also was asked to do one before starting HRT, maybe it has to do with checking fertility?
ffs.  i had my psychologist appointment, blood work and script within 10 weeks of me finally realising i am trans (after blocking it out due to childhood trauma for 30 something years yay!)

Where are you located?  I will see if I can find some better resources for you.  Your GP is a fucking dickhead.  You deserve better
Out of curiosity how old are you, and what state are you in?
***T h e g i r l c u m j a r***
üòÇüòÇüòÇ I'm dead I cant
why would that matter tho?
üòï I hate the healthcare system!!! It should be this easy for everyone wtf
I had my HRT after my second appointment with an endocrinologist. It makes no sense why some countries make you jump through literal fucking hoops to get just medication. Surgeries? Sure, I can understand that, assuming it's covered under public health plans, but still
I also didn't need to sprog in a cup either. But that might be because I'm older and know I definitely don't want kids in the future.
My hunger ass could never be near it ü§£ü§§
* drooling *
I have no idea tbh
Yeah it‚Äôs insane I‚Äôm in Sweden and I have to wait for a fucking year just so someone can check if I can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria so I can then get HRT. So basically I have to wait for like a year and 1/4 a year which doesn‚Äôt include the like 3-4 months that I‚Äôve already spent trying to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria just so I can get some medication that makes me not want to die
N o o o o o we only like it fresh and from the tap none of that cursed jar nonsense lmao
...I literally told my family doctor I was trans and wanted to transition. He was like ""Ok, let me see what I can do."" I assume he did some research, then within the year I got an appointment with my endocrinologist. No tests, no diagnosing, nothing. Hell, the only time I need a diagnosis is if I want surgery, which I do, and my endo already said she would be willing since I've been seeing her over a year for hrt.

Eventually I told my parents I was using this name (it was part of a larger conversation about using alternative names online and I suggested I could use my chosen name although they didn‚Äôt know it was my chosen name) at school and all of my friends called me it instead. I tried explaining how it made me uncomfortable to use my old name and especially identifying myself as it felt gross. When they didn‚Äôt react to badly to that I tried to discuss how I thought it was interesting that saying my legal first name (the name they usually use for me is a shortened version of the legal one) doesn‚Äôt feel uncomfortable because no one ever calls me it and so I don‚Äôt associate it with me. They misunderstood that as my legal name was now my preferred name and they should make sure everyone calls me that instead. They made it very clear they would never call me by my chosen name because ‚Äúit was too hard to switch to the other name‚Äù but were fine if friends called me that. It really sucks they totally missed the point of discussion and are gonna ruin my legal name for me too (which I do think is pretty I just don‚Äôt think it is my name) but at least they won‚Äôt be mad if my friends call me Wyatt.

Skipping to today my mom comes into my room and tells me she has switched my name from my shortened name to my legal name in my highschools computer system and they will be issuing me a new Id tag with my legal name on it (which is stupid cause that is already the name on my Tag but almost all the teachers still call me the short one with a few calling me my chosen name) so that all the teachers will call me my legal name. She talks about how she thinks it cute that I will use my legal name with family and then use my chosen name with non-family the same way her family used a cute nickname for her and then she used her legal name outside of the house except for me it‚Äôs reversed. She didn‚Äôt understand why I was so short and annoyed with her about this and tried to get me excited before leaving. 

I get that my parents aren‚Äôt the worst parents possible but it really hurts that they don‚Äôt understand that the name they are using isn‚Äôt my name. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs the legal one or the shortened one, it isn‚Äôt my name and it‚Äôs not going to go back to being my name. If they were at least trying to use my pronouns or my name I wouldn‚Äôt be so upset but they won‚Äôt even make an attempt to. They just think all is fine with them not changing names and it will just be like that forever. Right now I have to rely on them but as soon as I‚Äôm not I am going to make it very clear that this is my name and these are my pronouns and if they don‚Äôt want to put in the effort to change I‚Äôm not dealing with them anymore. I have friends who support me and put in the effort and if my parents don‚Äôt want to do the same they can leave. I don‚Äôt need them to keep hurting me because ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt see the signs‚Äù and think I‚Äôm wrong. I know me and I know what I want."	"I‚Äôm giving some serious side-eye right now to ‚ÄúOh, of course we can‚Äôt call you your chosen name because it‚Äôs too hard to switch, but we can call you your full legal name that we‚Äôve never used for you before.‚Äù The part that‚Äôs hard about switching to using a new name for someone is the habit of using the old one. I switched from using one shortening of my birth name to another at the start of high school, so when I was 14. As of last year, my brother still called me the name that I used in elementary and junior high. That‚Äôs 23 years ago. So yeah, habits can be hard to break! But the similarity of the new name to the old name actually does absolutely nothing to make that adjustment easier!

I‚Äôd be really clear with your mom. Let her know that you‚Äôre not looking for her to start using your legal name, and you don‚Äôt want her to intervene to get anyone else to use your legal name either. You just want her to use your chosen name, and if she won‚Äôt that‚Äôs her choice but it‚Äôs going to hurt her relationship with you.

I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs happening to you, Wyatt! Hang in there man!
Can you change your own name in the school system?
Jesus that's so frustrating, I am sorry you are going through that. If you can I would keep your old ID and not use the new one and just have a conversation with your teachers to know what name you really prefer. Don't let your parents control the way people refer to you, if you can of course. I know everyone's situation is different and it's not as simple as it sounds when I type this. Stay strong and always come here to vent, we are all here for you!!! üíúüíúüíú
Cis parents think the bar for raising trans kids is just not disowning them because half of all trans kids are disowned and they don't realize you can disown them and you're in charge of what nursing home they'll end up in. I went through the same thing with my parents and it took a few months blocking their calls and going no contact for them to realize I was serious. I get this isn't an option for you as long as you live with them but it's gonna be a harsh wake up call when you move out and you can choose how much contact you have with them, if any.
YA KNOW WHAT SCREW THEM! Just be you as long as your happy thats all that matters were here to support you! Keep going!
Just text your parents ""My name is X and I am your X. If you continue to call me Y or your Y I will be cutting you out of my life entirely ASAP."" and then start looking for a place to stay beginning on your 18th birthday before they've even had a chance to react.
Trying my best. I totally agree that switching names is hard and switching to one similar is easier than a whole new name it just sucks they aren‚Äôt trying to adjust. I would try to make things more clear about my name but my worry is that it will result similarly to when I tried to encourage them to switch pronouns (I use all pronouns and was requesting my parents to try using more than just she/her here and there) almost a year ago. There was a lot of arguments and hurtful words thrown around that made it clear that my mom in particular was not going to be trying anything different anytime soon. I‚Äôm worried that if I try to clarify names with my parents it will reignite similar fights and I don‚Äôt know if I can handle that when I don‚Äôt have an option to leave anywhere even just for a little as where I live it is still quite cold right now and the public transportation is even worse. It‚Äôs one of the main reason I am willing to wait the two years before I can safely leave just in case it does go similarly. I am not and would not be in any physical danger it‚Äôs just the emotional toll it would take is more than I am at least currently able to put myself through.
Not with out parent permission which I have no idea how asking for that would go. I was kinda hoping she changed it to my chosen name and have taken something away from that conversation but that was too big of a hope
If I can I will be. My school works a little differently so I end up interacting with loads of teachers only once or twice which is one of the main reasons I‚Äôve only told a few teachers, as I‚Äôm sure you know it is pretty exhausting to explain the situation to a teacher I only talk to once the whole year. I also attend a Catholic school so telling a teacher is a little like spinning a roulette wheel every time. So far I‚Äôve mostly told the teachers I have to frequently fill out forms for as they don‚Äôt usually need the name that is in the system and just need to be able to recognize it‚Äôs me. My drama teacher (surprise surprise, the drama teacher is used to gay and trans kids/j) has been really supportive through the whole process and has even switched names twice for me and makes sure that the name used in anything that reaches my parents has the old name to help avoid any problems for me. I‚Äôm really glad to have at least a few adults in my life using my actual name it just sucks that my parents aren‚Äôt apart of that group.
As soon as I can leave I will. I‚Äôve only got two more years and then I‚Äôll be out but right now I‚Äôm stuck here and I don‚Äôt want to risk this going sideways while I don‚Äôt have anywhere to go
I‚Äôve got you. Yeah, it may not be worth making this a battleground. Do you think it would help (and that your mom would be receptive) if you let her use your legal name, but asked her to let you handle who calls you what outside of your immediate family?

Either way, that sucks man. I hope she manages to build a bridge to get over herself soon!
A similar ultimatum/warning is what got my own parents to shape up. Though I did have cheap babysitting to hold over them...
Exactly why I will be posing it when I have the ability to leave this situation. I am not and would not be put in any physical danger for putting forward this ultimatum before I can leave but I worry about the arguments and emotional toll this could take if they don‚Äôt change their behaviour. At least right now I could not deal with similar arguments to those I had with my parents when I first tried to ask them to use other pronouns almost a year ago now."	sham15	trans	130	0.99	2022-01-31 20:02:33
Regarding JK Rowling	"***and if you don‚Äôt agree, or feel like you are exempt. Then this post is definitely not for you, and you don‚Äôt need to substantiate yourself. Please let me feel things.** 

I was the kid that read each book, and read it again because it was so magical. I went to the midnight release of the last book, I had dressed as Hermione and I won the contest and got my book free. At the time, it was one of the greatest days of my life. I was abused and I felt like the boy under the staircase, waiting for someone to fly me somewhere else. 

I love how Fantastic Beasts looks and it just makes me mad. I‚Äôm so angry that JK gave us a world that so many people fell in love with, and it turned out she was the villain the whole time. I LOVED Harry Potter. ADORED Harry Potter. My heart breaks a little bit every time I still see people supporting it. I know it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs something they‚Äôre into, possibly their whole life, but. There are real people dying because of hatred like that. I‚Äôm mad because I love it but it hurts to even look at. And the deeper you dive into her works, the more she subtly stained her hatred into it. I hate JK Rowling because she took away something that I truly loved but refuse to support anymore.

When I was a baby, I ate rat poisoning. At the time I probably thought it tasted good, and I didn‚Äôt have any idea it was poison because I didn‚Äôt know any better 

When I loved Harry Potter, I thought it was good, and I didn‚Äôt have any idea it was poison because I didn‚Äôt know any better. I‚Äôm not going to consume something from someone who thinks I shouldn‚Äôt exist"	"I'm right there with you. I absolutely adored Harry Potter growing up. My cat is named after one of the characters. My dad watched the movies every single time they were on TV, but never read them. When he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, he finally read them & it helped him immensely with coming to terms with his mortality. Those books have given me so much over the years, and it truly hurts to see JK's true colors. I won't give another cent to her. I don't want to engage in anything she's created, and it sucks because it has been such a significant thing in my life for such a long time
She wrote in poly juice potion, for god‚Äôs sake!

There is no way, no world, where those wizards aren‚Äôt getting gender freaky every night. 

The more I think about JK, the more I come to realize that she got lucky. She didn‚Äôt think it through. If you fingernail scratch through the veneer of her world, you‚Äôll discover that she didn‚Äôt consider the consequences of the ‚Äúreality‚Äù of her magical world. 

And all she had to do was sit on her piles of money and just shut up to remain the most beloved children‚Äôs author of all time. Instead we learned about wizards deficating, nonsense names for foreign wizard schools, and how much she really doesn‚Äôt like it when people don‚Äôt conform to their assignment at birth. 

Honey, I‚Äôll commiserate over JK‚Äôs speed run into bigotry any day of the week.
I hear you! I also wrote trans characters into Harry Potter in my headcannon. And I LOVED those books. I also find myself frustrated with JK and with the fact that so many people are (seemingly) on board with the crazy, harmful, and downright vile things she spouts online. But I'm more than happy to give up HP to not support her.
It‚Äôs being a constant tug of war regarding upvotes and downvotes, which I find interesting
I won't be playing the new game for this exact reason, and it sucks bc it looks amazing so far, minus the whole quelling the uprising of a Jewish stereotype thing.
I have a hard time understanding how someone who created a magical world hidden under society's nose being explored by a kid literally forced into growing up in closet had such a deep seated hatred towards the trans community. She coulda done so much good for the LGBT+ world but she woke up and choose violence and hate.
I'm right there with you, mate. I grew up with hp as well, read the books and bought merch before knowing i was trans and before knowing how evil she really is. I've fully stopped supporting anything related to her because it feel truly disgusting to give money to someone who wants you to not exist. And it hurts, having something you used to love and grew up with be tied to someone so vile. 

What hurts even more is that my friends are still consuming hp-related content, even tho they know her stance on it. I really don't know what to do about that tho
The first HP book was one of the first books I remember reading entirely in Braille. I'm sad that she turned out to be a monster. I'm sad that the new movies and video game are giving JKR influence. Why the heck does the racist TERF who made a funny little wizard book have a say in politics anyway? I'm not gonna buy the game, even if I know my family will. Even so, I'm more sad, because I know not buying her crap won't be enough to get her to stop ruining trans peoples' lives.
It's times like these I really want to write a good fan fic reframing the whole thing as an allegory for being trans. I hate that so many people have had such a formative part of their childhood taken away from them and the setup of the way the world works is practically begging for it. It also appeals to my inner spiteful bitch :p (Ok, in my case I have more of an outer spiteful bitch, but you get what I'm saying!)
Which is an entirely thoughtful point.  

You can love something, feel a connection to parts of it (how many trans people felt that connection to ""Harry finds out he's part of a completely different world than the one he was born in, and flourished once he got to that other world"" aspect?), to some degree be shaped by it, and also have the maturity to refuse to support the creator any further after her being a terrible human being came to light.

The saddest part to me is, all the hidden awful in those works...had it been done to hint at a deeper grass-is-greener allegory of ""It's not that wizards are good and muggles are bad...it's that wizards are a different kind of bad"", had she not had a heart filled with hate, it could've been a completely different kind of powerful message.
One day people may compare JK Rowling to all the other abusers who used their fame to glamour people while abusing vulnerable people right under their noses. We're not there yet.
Art and artist is always a complicated subject.  One of the best examples is Gertrude Stein, who was a phenomenal anti-capitalist lesbian poet...

... she also had friends in high (nazi) places, who helped her through German occupation.

She spoke in favour of Franco, Mussolini, and Petain. 

Her art is no less beautiful, though she herself deserves no reverence for it.
as a trans kid who loves harry potter, i would consider the fact that most if not all the main character leads in the movies have put down jkr for her transphobia, and solidified that they are supportive. my opinion is that she shouldn‚Äôt be able to take away something you love, and that she is simply a hypocrite because good god, she literally has metaphors for discrimination in her own stories! don‚Äôt let her take away the magic for you. there‚Äôs nothing wrong with harry potter, just her.
‚ÄúLove the product not the creator‚Äù Is probably the best you can so, I understand you don‚Äôt want to give money to JK but a few people boycotting wont change the fact she‚Äôs already rich as fuck
I remember me, in like 5th grade, reading that chapter thinking ""I'd turn myself into a girl, like, every hour on the hour, probably do weird sex stuff too"".

Although now all I can think of is Hermione going ""Millicent Bullstrode must have a boyfriend! And the potion isn't supposed to be used for cross gender transformations, JK Rowling said so.""
The difference is, a dead artist can't hurt anyone by others talking about their work. The same isn't true when we keep a bigoted billionaire actively trying to hurt us relevant by supporting her work
It's the same thing with Lovecraft.

However an academic discussion of art and artist can only occur after one very important event.

The death of the author.

Until that happens, anyone who supports Harry Potter is supporting a billionaire who is actively hurting the trans community. There's debating that. Enjoying Harry Potter any more than just in the privacy of your own home hurts trans people and it will till JKR isn't around anymore. It sucks that's how it is but that's the reality.
Oh sure, but that's more an issue of money than art.  Read her books, pirate them shits."	u8c2ad	trans	130	0.94	2022-04-21 01:36:53
Think I saw a trans sister yesterday but didn‚Äôt want to seem offensive.	"I‚Äôm sorry if this makes anyone mad, contemplating whether I should ask this at all. But when I see someone in public who might possibly be trans is there a way I can make sure?

(There‚Äôs a war about this going on in my head right now please be nice I‚Äôm sorry if this is selfish)"	"If you wanna strike up a conversation with them, that seems fine. Let them bring it up to you though.
This might sound a little harsh, but I‚Äôm just coming from my perspective-Unless they seem like they‚Äôre trying to meet people, you should probably leave them alone. 

They might just want to get their bagel at the coffee shop or buy their book or whatever it is that they are doing and not have to deal with being trans, or maybe they just don‚Äôt want to deal with socializing at all. You know? They may just wanna exist. 

If they seem like they‚Äôre trying to be social, be mindful-Definitely don‚Äôt just ask if they are trans. Like another poster said, ‚Äúhey sister!‚Äù might be one way to approach it-or a trans in-joke of some sort.

Ultimately though, unfortunately, other trans people are just out here trying to exist too, and just because they‚Äôre in public doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre looking for friends or that they want to be approached by other people, trans or otherwise. Like, being in the same marginalized group doesn‚Äôt entitle us to each other‚Äôs time/energy/attention.

Being trans also doesn‚Äôt entitle you to know whether or not other people are trans or other intimate details of their life/gender. You know what I mean? They are just other people trying to get through the day as well.

I don‚Äôt mean this to say like, you think you‚Äôre shitty or entitled to others-I‚Äôm just sharing my perspective as an introverted trans person who is also somewhat of a local celebrity who, sometimes, just wants to buy coffee without being reminded I‚Äôm trans or having to socialize with/exert effort for people I don‚Äôt know.
You could buy a piece of trans jewelry like a necklace w the trans flag. Something like that you could even keep inside your shirt if you aren‚Äôt out publicly but then pull it out when around potential sisters. If they notice they‚Äôll strike up a convo w you
The passwords are ""heat from fire"" and ""fire from heat"".

Jokes aside, as folx have emphasized, just be mindful. I'm not huge on having my transness proclaimed loudly in public spaces if said space is an unfamiliar one - if I've not spent much time there, don't know if there may be people in that environment who are transphobes.
Asking if someone is trans in public is pretty much the same as telling someone they don‚Äôt pass
I was on a date with this one guy before who didn‚Äôt know I was trans yet and this trans woman at a bar almost outed me ‚Ä¶ just be careful with your words.
I‚Äôm also mtf btw‚Ä¶
Well I think it's best not to go put of my way to clock people but when I see someone who is clearly trans or I suspect might be I just give them a bigger smile and a little extra love without being obvious and I let them live their life. I don't think it's appropriate to ask or to push a connection. It shouldn't be important to make sure and it would be invasive to do so.
""You don't pass, sweetie, and you're [TRANSGENDER] which means that we will automatically get along. I hope you don't mind me announcing that you are trans to everyone within view and earshot, babe! Yasss sister!""

Don't. Being trans isn't a fandom, it isn't a hobby.

Many trans people like living stealth, and just because your eye is better than the surrounding cissies does NOT mean it's your place to ruin that for them.
Just say heat from fire
Its veeeery tough people don't  wanna be outed in public but I would say the best idea would be to wear some trans pride colors something and just try to strike up and convo with a stranger. Ideally if they are trans they will notice your pride (whatever it may be) and probably will compliment it. Also ""heat from fire"" and ""fire from heat"" but that is much less common for people to recognize from what I have seen.
I'd probably feel pretty awkward if you asked me straight-up, but if you seemed nice I'd probably be honest with you. Like many of the people here have already said, I am just living my life, but I personally don't mind friendly people even if they might be a bit too up-front at first.

I suppose being friendly and then easing your way into that territory would work best for me personally, but I have no idea if that'd be viable for anybody else, I'd personally assume not.

No, because they might not be comfortable talking about it, and might want to keep their own personal safety and privacy.
Just smile and say hello.  If conversation flows, good and well.
I like to just say ‚Äúheyyyy sister! How‚Äôs it going‚Äù 

I feel like it doesn‚Äôt out them, and let‚Äôs them know that you‚Äôre also trans.
I'd say leave her the fuck alone. I hate myself enough for being trans without someone outing me without my consent, and I can't imagine I'm alone in that.
Idk depends on their vibe but if I get the chance My brain loves to be like ‚ÄúYOU AND ME, WE ARE THE SAME‚Äù like a dog when their owner comes home
Personally I don‚Äôt mind if people know I‚Äôm trans but i feel like it shouldn‚Äôt be the soul reason to strike up a conversation with another trans person so i think complementing their outfit/makeup/hair/shoes is better but As for ‚Äúmaking sure‚Äù i don‚Äôt really think that is something you as an individual should worry about (not trying to make it seem like this was an offensive question)   Just because you don‚Äôt know what mental state they are in and it always helps to try and complement someone another tip always use gender neutral forms of social call outs ex: babe/baby/honey/ queen etc also ya im aware queen is a gendered word but i feel like it can be used towards men and women cuz of its use in the culture of the queer community sorry if this helps/doesn‚Äôt help at all but this is just my ¬¢2
From my point of view, there is nothing wrong if you approach someone and try to strike a conversation; i get that some people may think that it's a clear statement of ""you don't pass"" if you want to do so because you may think that person is trans, but if you keep a normal approach, like you would with any cisgender person you may be interested on just based on first glance, so without bringing up anything trans related at first, then it all boils down to simple charm and chemistry.

If i found myself in your situation (22 MTF here, never met a person who stepped in my shoes irl, so i would love to meet someone to exchange my experience with) i would defo just try to talk to her, treating her respectfully as who she is without questioning her gender!
My point is simply that i think that if no one acts, everyone will stay in their little bubble forever, frequently you have to risk to be rude when meeting new people but that's simply how it goes, you can't understand and set boundaries with anyone if you don't talk first imo.
Do you want to be treated and viewed as women or ‚Äútrans‚Äù women?  Why does it matter if a woman you meet is cis or trans?  It seems developing a friendship is most important.

I am gender non conforming and know I don‚Äôt pass as woman.
I personally wouldn‚Äôt treat them any differently. Recognizing they‚Äôre trans when they don‚Äôt have anything outwardly showing they are (such as pride pins) could make them worry that they don‚Äôt pass.
That‚Äôs not a big deal. I see a few every day. If they are minding their business, you should mind your own and leave them alone.
Thank you üòä
What if they are wearing something to identify them as trans? Such as jewelry with the trans pride flag colors? Is it ok to be like, ‚Äúcute necklace!‚Äù?
What is this a reference to? I keep seeing it in this thread and don't know what it is because I basically live under an actual rock.
Fire from heat
Is it terrible that I‚Äôm looking forward to trying this out? I guess I just think it‚Äôd be cool to meet another trans person from the interwebs.
I prefer hey girl cuz cis folks can be perceptive
I must be missing something. How does that phrase let them know you're trans?

(I get heat from fire and all the other references)
Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any need to cuss‚Ä¶ this is the most popular answer it seems. Think I‚Äôll get a necklace or pin or something. If anyone wants to talk they can come to me.
I think OP is literally just hoping to connect with other trans people IRL *in general*. That‚Äôs not to say that trans and cis people should be treated any differently, but I know how excited I get when I meet someone else in the LGBTQ+ community, ESPECIALLY fellow trans men, since I‚Äôm FtM. OP‚Äôs question wasn‚Äôt about gender conformity/nonconformity at all, OP wanted to ‚Äúmake sure‚Äù in order to not come off disrespectful by flat out asking someone they haven‚Äôt even talked to yet since it could be dangerous for one or both parties.
Just to build off of it, because i felt the poster just brushed it by, but some trans person though might actually want. Speaking from an extroverted trans perpective, I would love for to talk to a fellow trans for a bit of ny day. Trans people come in all shapes and sizes. Litterally, i met a FTM who hate MTFs. So just as many trans people who would like to exist and not chat, there are as many that would like to chat, so you just have to try to look out for some social cues to see if they want to talk or not.
As long as you're considering how the other person feels I'm sure you can make an informed decision about it.
Trans Voice Lessons on YouTube
Ahhhhhh you‚Äôre right sister might raise questions. I will switch to girl
Hey sister, said by a woman to another woman, acknowledges that the other person is a woman and projects the idea of ""I am too!"". In addition to that there's a little bit of queerdar going on, so combine the two with a knowing look and the implication might be strong enough to send the hint.
Thanks sharing your perspective on the OP question.  I hope that someday we all can just be without labels.  But I understand what you are saying about belonging or at least that is what I am getting."	r6koxz	trans	127	0.99	2021-12-01 17:54:51
I came out as trans (ftm) to my mom yesterday but need help telling my husband	"So I am a 44 year old that was born female. I have always thought that I was born in the wrong body. The first time I can remember having dysphoria, I was only 5 and I can remember screaming and crying because I hated my long hair. I wanted my hair short like the other boys. My stepmom got really mad and put my long hair in a ponytail and very angrily chopped it off. 
At that age I had no idea what was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me. Why didn‚Äôt I fit in? Why did I have to wear dresses? Which I hated so much even though I was sent to a Christian school that required all girls to wear dresses or skirts. This all caused me to be a very quiet and reserved child. 
I struggled with social situations in school and never really fit in with the other girls. 
Let‚Äôs fast forward about 25 years and here I am, mother of 3 married to a man. I finally got the nerve up to tell my mom the truth yesterday. I don‚Äôt think she was very surprised. She said that she just wants me to be happy and she loves me no matter what. I‚Äôm so glad I have such a supportive mom. My father passed away 6 years ago so she‚Äôs all I have.
The problem is telling my husband. He hasn‚Äôt noticed the changes, like me wearing a lot of mens clothes, cutting my hair very short, using mens body wash. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs ignorant to the situation or if he just doesn‚Äôt want to see what‚Äôs happening, but I want to be able to tell him so I can get started on testosterone and finally start living my true life. 
I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm rambling on but if anyone has been through a similar situation or has any advice, I would love to hear from you. 
Thank you friends! Have a great day!

P.S. Reddit won‚Äôt let me change my username to @bassmountainguy. I guess we can‚Äôt change it only create a new accountüòÅ

No advice just good luck! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I‚Äôm sure he already knows
Unfortunately I have to agree. Would be nice if there was a magic solution. I came out to my wife just recently. She's not exactly happy, but she's been very supportive. We've had many emotional talks. It's hard to see the hurt in her eyes. But the love is still there too. It most likely won't be a single conversation with your husband either. 

Also with my wife not being lesbian or bi, it's difficult for her to see me as another woman. But she told me she would never leave me. I also have to deal with the idea that I'm taking her husband away. But I know that I can't forgo the path I'm on now. I need to see it through. I know I'm a woman, as you know you're a man. I hope your husband is as understanding as my wife has been. Either way I don't think we can be completely there for our spouses if we don't feel complete ourselves.

Good luck on your journey and I hope everything turns out well for you. You most likely have some emotional days ahead. I hope the best for you.
Thank you. Its going to be hard, but I‚Äôm just so scared of his reaction. I‚Äôm currently a stay at home spouse with no license or income so that makes it extremely difficult. I‚Äôve been trying to get a job but my husband keep sabotaging them. I‚Äôm just praying that the universe will send me in the right direction.
Thank you üôè

As a gay trans dude who had his partner come out as a transfem nonbinary person, I feel this 100%. I am fully gay and would not fall in love with nonmen, so for me to reconcile my love for them with my sexuality was difficult. But for me, I love her truly the same. 

It's hard, but I hope both you, your wife, and op can find your joy.
I'm sorry but why does your husband sabotage your jobs?
Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to play dumb than face reality. Fear of the unknown I guess. Stay strong
He‚Äôs very insecure and feels like I wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù him anymore. He struggles bad with abandonment and self esteem issues.
Thank you!
I'm so sorry you're dealing with that, but I'm going to be honest... This sounds horrifically toxic. Please take care.
I‚Äôm kind of concerned now. If he is scared that you won‚Äôt need him if you get a job, then I really doubt he will take it well when you tell him that you‚Äôre a man. You know best how he handles news that he can‚Äôt process well, but please be prepared for whatever that will mean. It could still go relatively well, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine your relationship remaining anything like it currently is if he sees your role in this way. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news (and hopefully I‚Äôm wrong) but it may be wise to be ready for disappointment. Hopefully whatever his initial reaction might be he will love you for who you are and in the long run you guys can make the best out of whatever your relationship becomes. None of this is easy.
Ah I'm sorry, dude.
I'm concerned a bit now. My ex/wife  is very independent but is having hard time with feeling lied to ext. (Like join the club lied to myself for decade's.
No don‚Äôt be sorry. It is ABSOLUTELY toxic. My mom and family have been concerned for years. It‚Äôs just taken me to get sober, 3 years now, to see my relationship with him for what it really is. I‚Äôm completely isolated in the country with no drivers license or any way to get around. I‚Äôm lucky if I get to leave my house once a week to go grocery shopping. I‚Äôm ashamed that have gotten myself into this rotten position. Ugh‚Ä¶. Life is hard.
I appreciate your concern. I do understand. It‚Äôs scary thinking that life as I know it could be over. I know that he loves me, but I‚Äôm not sure how deep that love goes. Luckily my mom would be more than happy to take me in, but I have a pit bull and 2 cats that I probably couldn‚Äôt take with me. It‚Äôs a lot to process but I think it will be worth the work to be happy. I was a photographer and graphic designer before we met so it‚Äôs kind of exciting thinking about getting a job and being an active member of society again. I could get my license back in no time and be self sufficient again. It‚Äôs sounds like a dream when I read this back. I‚Äôm just thankful for this wonderful community to support me along the way‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you
Sorry I‚Äôm a little confused. Is she lying to you or she she having trust issue‚Äôs herself?
You probably already know this, dude, but be sure you have a plan to get out of there in a hurry if need be. Your husband ticks a whole bunch of red flags.
PLEASE don't be ashamed! Please please please. I recently just discovered how abusive my past situation was (my parents for me) after 20 years. It's so hard and so scary to confront that you're in an abusive or toxic situation, and it's not easy. Do not blame yourself. He took advantage of you.

Please do not feel ashamed to ask for help. Your mum seems lovely, and I think you need to reach out and TELL THEM what he's doing. You need to get out.

Honestly, I don't think you should come out. He's genuinely abusing you and coming out may make it worse. As someone who reached out to loved ones to escape, please contact your parents. I'm sure your mother would be happy to assist. Also reach out to domestic violence networks.
Glad to hear that you‚Äôre sober! I have a year, myself!
It‚Äôs definitely a lot to process, but you‚Äôre actually encouraging me with your confidence. I hope it goes well. I can tell you can handle whatever happens.
She feels lied to because I never told her I was trans, something I pretty much never acknowledge myself
Thank you. I‚Äôm working on that as we speak.
I‚Äôm so sorry that I am just seeing this. Thank you so much for your concern. It‚Äôs sad to hear that you were in a similar situation, especially from your parents. I‚Äôm working with friends and family to try to make things as safe as possible. I feel like he should already see that I‚Äôve been changing. I can pass most days as a cis man. Like women look at me funny in the woman‚Äôs restroom and stuff yet my own partner doesn‚Äôt question that things have changed. I think I‚Äôm his mind he thinks that I must have found another man. He has no idea that I am actually just finding myselfü•∞ How are you now? Are you in a safer place?
Congratulations!
I‚Äôm trying to go into this with the best attitude possibleüòÅ I have my first Testosterone appointment scheduled for March 25, I was supposed to go tomorrow but had to reschedule due to lack of sufficient funds, but I‚Äôm excited to start this journey. Have a great day my friend!
Oh yeah, I can understand how she might feel that way. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs extremely hard for the other partner to understand. They may blame themselves or try to deny it all together. I can‚Äôt imagine how my husband will react. He‚Äôs not very LGBTQ friendly.
To be fair- if you think he might respond aggressively, you are under no obligation to tell him. He sounds very controlling as it is, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he tried to invalidate your identity in some way
Thank you. He is very controlling. I think I‚Äôm kind of afraid of that. Knowing him he will say that it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt like him and I‚Äôm making excuses. He always finds a way to make it about him.
Sounds like my parents (aka like a narcissist). It‚Äôs hard to live around someone like that and take care of yourself in the meantime, especially if they‚Äôre constantly invalidating your identity. I wound up having to give them an ultimatum about it- respect my identity or you‚Äôre losing me, and that worked, but it‚Äôs not an offer I would want anyone to have to make.

 I‚Äôm rooting for you no matter what happens, and hope you find yourself in a safe and happy place soon
I agree, I wouldn't come out to him. I'm in the exact same situation. My husband would probably pretend to be supportive but make fun of me in the process and then act like I don't have a sense of humor. You know if it's safe or not, if it's not I'd break it off and never let him hurt you with that information. You don't owe anyone an explanation.
I‚Äôm sorry you had to go thru that with your parents. Thank goodness my mom accepts me for who I am. Thank you so much for your support! It means a lot.
Thank you! I‚Äôm sorry your in the same situation. It‚Äôs tough when you‚Äôre not sure house your spouse will react."	t47x62	trans	125	0.97	2022-03-01 13:28:54
Ran into my first major transphobe. I could use some encouragement. <3	"I work in the service industry. Details withheld to protect my identity, and my job if coworkers/supervisors see this.  I experienced my first major transphobic event/slur today. On top of my already pegged anxiety, it has had my mood shifting between crying and depressed and angry as frack.  


 I was helping a customer today. She was as pleasant as one could ask at first.  The first time she was unable to get her way she started to get nasty with me, strait into Karen mode.  Asked to see the manager. A lower manager came over. I told them exactly the chain of events, what the customer wanted, and what I said. The manger looked at the customer, and back to me and said sounds like you did what you were supposed to, supporting me and leaves.

In response to this the KAREN shouted I haven't even told my side of it yet.  ""This stupid heshe won't give me my discounts!"" To which I calmly responded, ""Excuse me, what did you say."" Her retort was ""You f\*ing heard me you f\*ing heshe\*"" To which I slightly less calmly said, ""That is enough, we are no longer serving you. Your verbal abuse is not welcome. I will call someone to get your unpaid for items, because I am unable to lift the heavy items.""  
She then rammed me with her electric cart, and chased the manager who had just walked away. I slowly walked over there and informed him I had refused her further service for verbal abuse and slurs. Of course being younger he just took the path of least resistance and gave in to her demands. This made me so mad I almost walked out right there. Not the young guy just trying to save himself a headache, he isn't a real manager and I dont blame him. But the karen throwing around verbal abuse and slurs and still getting her way.

I called over the major manager on duty and told him what happened. I said ""if it had been the N word or another racial slur she would have been escorted out without further questions."" He walked over to do just that once he know, but by then she had already gotten her way and finished her transaction. SO he just let her go and told me if it happens again to disengage completely and call a major manager directly. I could tell he was upset that I had been mistreated, and knew I was upset. He sent someone to give me a break right as soon as someone was free. Which was good because I was on the verge of tears.

&#x200B;

In the grand  scheme of things it was just one customer, and it wasn't the T word. But it still hurts. Here I am 12ish hours later and my feelings are still raw from this.

Edit: thank you everyone for all the comments. By the time I was able to post I was mostly over it.  Being able to share it was the cathartic release I really needed. All of your comments remind me that I am not alone, and that we all process things like this slightly differently. Love you all <3."	"If I ever see her I will suplex her for you. Not that I know either of you. I‚Äôll just have to suplex every transphobe until I get the right one.
First off, I'd like to say I am sorry you had this experience with a such a hateful person.

There is no excuse for hate or ignorance of any kind.

But the worst of this situation is over now and you had time to de-escalate your emotions and post your story here which is very healthy.

I've worked in customer service for years. Being called every name in the book because they hate the company I work for.

When I took the job, i was immediately told that customers are from all walks of life and they will be nasty and rude. This is where skill shines in de-escalation tactics even dealing with any outspoken ""Karen"". 

Big companies will always take the customers side because of social media and negative customer reviews or influence. Also because it's easier to give Karen what she wants and can de-escalate the employee later because we all have to make a living so we keep our jobs rather than looking for another one. Believe me honey, we're all replaceable to some extent regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. I don't like it any more than you do but companies see their employees as numbers and that's it. 

They educate on sensitivity training because they want to avoid any complications with being labeled as non-supportive to certain groups so they appeal to everyone, even transphobic people. And sadly, they will fire an employee for other reasons rather than the real reason, discrimination or just wait for the employee to quit. ""At will employment"" in most states meaning we can fire you for any reason just like you can quit for any reason.

This doesn't excuse this type of behavior the customer has but it is the way the world works, sadly. I wish you all the love and support for dealing with a customer such as this and I hope you have less interactions than I do on the phone daily.

Sending my love and prayers for you that you more people can have compassion for you.
I‚Äôm so sorry. :(
If I ever see her I will Detroit Smash her into the sun for you. You definitely didn‚Äôt deserve that.
Huge hugs!  This is one of the TOUGHEST parts of service industry.  The navigation and balance between customers being absolutely shitty and at what point do you stop providing service üò£  I would have totally had them escorted out... no good will come from how that person is interacting.
Call her a piece of she-it
*sends some internet hugs*

Sorry, you had to go through that.
Hugs
She was just looking for something to get at you. She wanted that reaction out of you, I‚Äôm so proud of you for getting through this tho. Don‚Äôt give them the reaction they want, even though it‚Äôs hard. You got this girl ‚ô°
Ok. Sooo as someone who has worked retail for probably 1/4 of my 29 years retail customers are amoung some of the worst human beings on the planet. I always laugh at Karen's and bonded with my coworkers over making fun of their absurd requests. 
Look up viva la dirt league: Karen's on YouTube if you want a good laugh. It might just cheer you up. üòÇ

Other than that *hugs* you'll be ok. Your strong and pretty. Not many individuals have the strength to go through what this community does on a daily basis. üòäü•∞
Fuckin charge her with assault she hit you with her cart....furthermore state it was based on your gender...might get a hate crime thrown in there
Fuck the Karen and fuck your manager too tbh
What does not kill you will only make you stronger.
It sounds like you did everything you could. The fact that the actual manager is on your side is a good thing. You not know you can‚Äôt trust this assistant manager or wherever he is to have your back.

If she shows up again. Call the actual manager immediately and pointed out the customer and reiterate exactly what happened last time. 

If she never shows up again, Then is not something you‚Äôll ever have to worry about again from this vile person.
You can never expect a company to have your back, or anyone in managerial positions to have your back, because company policy is about avoiding expenses.

I try to keep in mind that people who act like this always reach for the first, most relevant insult(which when they scream at me is t-slur, f-slur etc) they can for anyone they‚Äôre interacting with, and they probably have an even more sad life than me, which is why they feel the need to be hurtful whenever they can.
Back during covid when I worked retail,  I was sent upfront by the door to make sure only a certain amount of customers got into the store and that they had a mask etc etc. Anyway during this I got called every thing under the sun especially if they saw my pronoun buttons so I understand where you're coming from but I am glad upure able to tell them you won't serve them anymore i can't really do that I'd LOVE to do that though omg kudos
I know it‚Äôs not what you want to hear but you strike me as quite young (not a bad thing) and as a trans lady myself but on the late end of the age scale I have to urge you to learn how to let this kind of thing just roll off. Trust me I know it‚Äôs a lot easier said that done but showing a reaction to these transphobic folk is only going to enable/encourage them to continue their actions. 

Unfortunately it‚Äôs a lot like dealing with a toddler, if you just ignore them and act like you didn‚Äôt hear them it‚Äôs quite earth shattering in their minds. It won‚Äôt change them but I promise you‚Äôll save yourself a lot of torment and trouble. 
Sorry you have to deal with this but that‚Äôs customer service for you it doesn‚Äôt matter what you are if they aren‚Äôt getting their way it‚Äôs personal.

Anyways.. I just hope you have a better day tomorrow. Seriously hurts to see people going through this.
OH YEA I HELLP U
Yesss! Love the my hero reference
I love VLDL. <3. I try to ignore the hate and just focus on the customers who are nice. This was just too far for me.
P.s. still sucks tho :/ I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with that, I worked as a barista for awhile and heard a lot of awful shit so I feel you
I am not young in age, but I have only been openly trans for a year. While I half agree with you, that a reaction is what they want.  No reaction or consequences let's them think they can get away with it. Only through social consequences will the casual use of slurs be deincetivized.

My best friend is trans and I 100% support him, but I keep getting his pronouns wrong by accident when talking to him. How can I fix this?	"My best friend is FtM and I've known him since we were little kids. He came out as trans a few months ago and we picked a new name and talked about everything this meant to him and us. Nothing changed between us, but I keep accidentally using the wrong pronouns and I feel horrible. He doesn't get mad or anything, but I want him to be happy and comfortable.

The problem is that when talking about him or to someone next to him I find myself using she/her instead of he/him. When typing it's super easy to use the right ones, but when speaking I slip up. I always correct myself whenever I notice, but I really need to stop this habit. I'm pretty sure it's just because I've known him for uses and have always called him she/her, which makes it more difficult for me to change it.

Any and all advice is appreciated!"	"Give him spray bottle with water, and ask him to spray you when you make a mistake. lol 

In all realness, just keep yourself in check. No one can make you say the proper thing except yourself. Just try to do better. You both will find it more gratifying. Best of luck to you both!
Practice when you're by yourself. Breaking habits is hard and takes effort but practicing on your own time will let you make those mistakes without anyone else around.
Hi I‚Äôm cis and my sibling is non binary so I needed to learn to adjust what pronouns I use for them. 

Practice is key. 
Stand in front of a mirror and repeat their pronouns in a sentence 50 times. 

Deliberately have conversations (with other people or just out loud to yourself) where you are using their pronoun. 

But practice. 
It‚Äôs the only way to form the new neural pathways and overwrite the old one.
Maybe you could try telling a story about him out loud when you're alone, and when you get it wrong start the sentence over.
Honestly as long as you know you are messing up and correcting yourself then you are good. People get bent out of shape over this way too much. You are fine and a great friend. Keep trying your best and show him that you support him.
Keep trying‚ò∫Ô∏è
Be patient with yourself, for one. These changes take time, and us trans people are understanding of that when it comes to supportive people like you. As for help in combatting the habit, I cannot stress enough to practice. Practice when you're alone, and/or with other people.
Just keep working on it like you‚Äôre doing. Some people find it helpful to ‚Äúpractice,‚Äù eg, try intentionally talking about him using the correct pronouns when he‚Äôs not around. Eventually your brain will catch up either way. Sounds like you are a good friend!
I‚Äôm a fully medically transitioned FTM and I get my own pronouns wrong sometimes! Here‚Äôs the issue: if you a genuinely a good person that makes mistakes and tries to better in the future so be it- a little forgiveness goes a long way. If you are a bad person that makes hurtful mistakes and continues them into order to hurt people - that‚Äôs a whole different story. Gender transition is hard for cis people to understand- it‚Äôs even hard for me to understand. Relax, do better the next time.
Work on changing your memories of him. Not that he used to be a girl and is a boy now. That he‚Äôs always been a boy. Working on your memories of him will help in the present tense with his pronouns. When you talk. Slow down. Be more deliberate with what you say. Think about it once through before you actually say anything. 

Time. Practice. Persistence.

Think of it as a colossal failure on the medical community when he was born. He had hormonal imbalance that is currently being corrected but that‚Äôs why the doctors fucked it up to begin with.

Gotta make sure you think of him as always a guy. He‚Äôs a guy. Parts might be different but that doesn‚Äôt change this particular fact.
This is a really sweet post, and shows you‚Äôre coming from a good place. Be patient with yourself. It‚Äôs completely alright that you‚Äôre making mistakes! Practice makes perfect. 

Others have already suggested practicing out loud, but I‚Äôm the kind of person who prefers writing. Maybe you could write up some stories you remember about him and experiences you‚Äôve had with him. Reviewing those memories using his new pronouns can help you keep using those pronouns consistently and successfully going forward.
It can be hard to adjust pronouns so dont beat yourself up too hard, just keep correcting yourself and it‚Äôll eventually get easier and natural, or you can practice by yourself by just repeating his pronouns over and over or practice using it in sentences, etc
I‚Äôm a trans male and my friends mess up my pronouns sometimes. I have known them for a year and I really don‚Äôt mind. I know they don‚Äôt do it on purpose, and always apologize. I‚Äôm not speaking for everyone, but it is a understanding thing that can happen. Don‚Äôt stress out too much! Just keep in mind his feelings and try your best. My friends supporting me was one of the biggest steps in my transitioning, so you loving him is a amazing thing at the least.
Hot take:

Buy him one of those enamel pronoun pins and ask him to wear it.  So you'll have a nice visual cue right there.
For practicing, try and tell stories/memories to yourself about your friend and use the proper pronouns. That way your brain gets more used to the switch when you‚Äôre in person
Even trans people can take bit to switch with other trans friends. It's just reprogramming
I'm trans, and I am normally great with pronouns, but I have one specific trans friend that I have misgendered, and I don't know why I have a problem getting his pronouns right.
With my ftm beastie I correct his pronouns in my head when I think about him that way there's never a point in time where I'm not at least trying to call him by his right pronouns
This may seem a bit adverse, but at first try to use pronouns *more* often than you normally would, increase the rate you use he/him with him, eventually you will begin to associate he/him with him more than she/her, and it will come more naturally to you
Practice talking about him alone to get use to the pronouns. You can just randomly belt out ‚ÄúI think (friend) is cool, he‚Äôs one of my bestest friends.‚Äù Or something like that lol
Go through a book or something and change all the pronouns to he/him. Alternatively‚Ä¶ his family‚Äôs Facebook and screenshot and write over every time someone uses the wrong pronouns that way you can actually mentally connect the pronouns to actively thinking of him.
Catching and correcting yourself is a great start. I‚Äôm trans too and I still mess up my friends‚Äô pronouns something. One thing I find helpful is to notice what situations they tend to come up in. Specifically you will use pronouns when there is a 3rd person in the conversion so that‚Äôs a time to pay attention and be more vigilant.
I‚Äôll start judging friends who misgender me they day I stop doing it to myself! Seriously, hardwired neural pathways take time to change, and I so rarely refer to myself in the third person, I haven‚Äôt had practice beating the new neural path into a walkable trail. Your friend is probably in the same boat. Language is not thought, its just a tool for discerning thought, and when you know someone has good thoughts, the language doesn‚Äôt really matter.
Ad you said it's normal, it takes time! Don't overthink it, it will come natural
I'm not trans but am close to somebody who is. The name change I was easy to switch to straight away, but the pro nouns I kept getting wrong, he pulled me up on it every time and after a little while I was used to it. Just takes a short while to change the thought process. You will get there.
Ok seriously though , what all cis people need to consider:
It‚Äôs not about the pronouns themselves. You need to do the internal work to tell yourself: this is a man. 

If you find yourself repeatedly making mistakes with pronouns it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre just trying to convert the language without taking the time to really see your friend in a new light.
My cousin is MTF and I sometimes mess up with the correct pronouns she is always understanding. She knows she has my 100% support. I always apologize when I mess up and she completely understands. I practice practice practice.
My best friend that I‚Äôve know for 20 years does the same thing. We grew up together so he‚Äôs always known me has he/him and I didn‚Äôt come out until January of this year. He still slips up sometimes but he corrects himself and apologizes. I understand it‚Äôs hard and as long as he‚Äôs trying I don‚Äôt let it bother me too much.
When you do mess up, dont beat yourself up about it, ive noticed when i beat myself up after using the wrong pronouns for someone it is likely to happen again. As a trans woman I am not hurt when someone i knew for a long time before accidentally uses he/him, I know they are trying to use she/her but it takes time to rework that subconscious part of speech. If I am thinking about someone and using their pronouns too I might practice by talking to someone else about them and preparing a sentence beforehand where I use the right pronouns
https://www.instagram.com/p/CCGwmg-Hb4-/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY= this is a helpful guide
The spray bottle idea is hilarious and I think we might do that haha, he would find it so funny. 

Thanks for the advice :)
Nothing like good old fashioned trans ingenuity.
Good job!
Yep! I‚Äôve done this for my trans friends and it really helps. Also correct yourself when you catch yourself if you can, it helps to remember. But also it will take a while to learn :)
This is a sweet idea, but I think I would actually be weirded out if someone did this for me lol
Psychologically speaking, the spray bottle, in theory, should speed up the process based on conditioning lol. I‚Äôd even throw in a piece of candy or something for getting it correct. üòÇ kidding, kinda. 

On a more serious note, my partner and I use different pronouns for each other now and it took a good month for us to get it down without accidentally using the old pronouns. It takes some time when you‚Äôve known someone for that long.

Keep trying and just be super mindful about it.

why do people think we're overly sensitive	"I woke up this morning and my ears had closed.
I went into the bathroom to push an earring through, and my mom asked what I was doing, so I told her

Then she said ""if you just let them close you won't have that problem you know""

She hated my ears being pierced, and my hair being long, the way I dress, my nails being painted, everything, so I said, ""you don't have to make comments about the way I look"" the way she said it was very ""I wish you'd let them close""

She makes little digs and comments all the time, and they build up. She got mad and said I'm sensitive and I shouldn't expect to dress the way I do without getting comments.

My dad starts taking her side and I told her, all I said was to not make comments about my appearance.

She said, ""you're just insecure about how you look, and you're projecting it on us.

That put me over the edge, because I'm a lot of things, but I'm not insecure about my appearance, I wear what I want, dress how I like, and would paint my nails, but I'm literally being forced to not paint them, because it embarrasses them.

I yelled ""let's be real here, you, are insecure about the way I look, not me, you told me I embarrass you, and that I look like a f*got, you said I'm pushing you away because you don't want to be seen with a gay looking son, you're the insecure ones, not me, I'd actually look the way I wanted if I didn't live with you.""

She just laughed

She was quiet for a minute, and then laughed, like, loud, and it just pissed me off so much.

I wanted to say, the second I move out of here, I'm gone.

The initial comment may seem small, but she says shit about how my hair looks bad all the time, and how I look gay, and tells me family members don't want to talk to me because of it.

At one point I told her, maybe if the don't want to talk to me over something so superficial, I don't want to talk to them either.

That of course just made her fly into talking about how my generation is so sensitive and whiny and we just wanna push our agenda.

The irony of course being she was whining and bitching over long hair and painted nails, while simultaneously pushing her agendaüôÑ"	"Because they're dumb bigots who need to vacate the planet asap.
I hope you don't mind me saying this, but your mom sounds like an asshole.
Because they're bigots and assholes who see our issues and problems as made up or petty so they think we're ridiculous for caring about them at all. Or it's a way to intentionally try to gaslight us into thinking our problems aren't important or worth listening to, so we stop bringing it up because it makes _them_ uncomfortable. Just like it's her projecting her issues with your appearance onto you, Usually they are the ones being overly sensitive and getting upset by us politely correcting them, but then they turn it around on us by blowing up about how sensitive we are and how dare u say anything about this at all.
Funny how she said you‚Äôre projecting, because as you said, you‚Äôre quite secure about how you want to look, and it‚Äôs their insecurity THEY are projecting on YOU.
you deserve better parents, I'm sorry you got stuck with such garbage people. You're better than them in every way, and don't let their comments make you think otherwise. The most vile of people like to make everyone who is different seem like the devil incarnate when really they are the one's who are horrible inside, and to face that reality would well and truly break their small and fragile minds. I would cut all contact with them as soon as you possibly can within reason, because they don't even deserve to breathe the same air as you.
Tell her to bite rocks and move on. Lost cause there it sounds like
going through the same thing and they do it because they can understand us‚Ä¶ and maybe they don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ my only advice is get out of there as soon as possible‚Ä¶ best wishes!
Because they will say anything to try to invalidate us!
What a lot of the older generations see as sensitivity is in reality just us having a backbone. Standing up for one's self isn't sensitivity, but getting all triggered over the way someone presents? Honey that wouldn't make someone a snowflake, it'd make them the whole fucking winter season.
Because media and politics often attack us with cherry picked info pushing that narrative.
Because they are ignorant, willfully or otherwise
my parents are the same! well my mom anyway. 

i dress punk (have since high school), piercings dyed hair ripped clothes platforms the whole 9. 

she likes to think that because i choose to dress outside of societal norms im not allowed to complain when people treat me like i‚Äôm an animal. 

it‚Äôs only gotten worse since i‚Äôve been presenting more and more how i want to but i‚Äôm still closeted from her and my dad.
no because she is insecure, probably stuck in her shitty marriage and feels constricted to all fuck, if anything she's projecting onto you, stay strong and stay beautiful.
Some people are overly sensitive, especially this community. Every other post on here is a vent, asking for advice, vent vent vent, asking for advice, vent again.
I honestly think this is an ""old people"" issue, they're always making snarky comments about people and are always running their mouths but when we do reply to them in the same tone they talked to us they get defensive or angry and sometimes even cry (I've seen it happen with my own eyes... lmao) I just don't understand that, if you can't stand the weight of your own words why would you say them to someone else? It's confusing.

As for advice, I'd just tell you to ""ignore"" your parents comments and try to move out ASAP (I know it's not easy to just ignore, but I'm assuming in the moment, you don't have a choice.)
I mean you just said what we were all thinking
She has zero self awareness.. it‚Äôs almost maddening
Funny, is not the word I'd use.
Jesus fuck, you hit the nail on the headüíÄ
Yeah, bc we aren't allowed to vent irl, bc we get called all sorts of names, and get told how whiny our generation is, so when you get a high concentration of people who aren't allowed to complain, of course there's gonna be a lot of venting posts, doesn't mean we're any more whiny than anyone else.
Sure, ‚Äúcurious‚Äù could work well, as in ‚ÄúCurious how she said‚Ä¶‚Äù
i tend to do that, dont let her try to invalidate how you feel, your emotions are extremely valid and if she wants to harm her  relationship with you over stitches and fabric and pigmented nail liquid then that's her problem, her fault, and shows how damaged as a human being she is. you're strong and deserve to feel validated, and im sorry that you can't be shown that at home but you're extremely valid, supported and loved, if she can't see past materialistic value in these items she doesn't deserve to make your brain feel less than or that her opinions are truth
Oh she's not making me feel invalid, it's just that

The hypocrisy is palpable

hun, everything you've said she said invalidated you as a trans individual

In need of advice? a conversation I had with my girlfriend happened a few nights ago and it‚Äôs made me feel unbelievably weird thinking about it though I can‚Äôt put my finger on why.		"it weirded me out too. though I can't say your partner is being transphobic because it's her mother.
your girlfriend is basically saying ""my mom is not okay with me dating a trans person so i don't want her to know I'm dating one"", and i guess that's fine, though I would've been disappointed if my partner said that instead of standing up for me.
on the other hand, I don't know your girlfriend's relationship with her mother, maybe she feels like she can't disobey her/disagree with her? if she's older than 20 it seems weird. she should be able to date anyone she wants regardless of her mother's opinion. esp when it comes to standing up for her partner to her transphobic mother.
I don't think i can give you any advice here but i think you're justified in feeling weird about it.
I get what you mean like just reading that made me feel uncomfortable like I get a mother's job is to help protect their kids and being overly worried is something do on a regular but like it made me think back to people constantly saying to me that my gender identity and sexuality as a lesbian wasnt valid until I transitioned like you shouldnt have to pick either a love life or transitioning why cant you do both idk thats just my opinion I've never met a girl willing to even date me yet so that's just my opinion as a girl that hasnt experienced love in over 6 years or being a girl in the relationship in general lol
as I see it, it's just her mother being weird, nothing about you two
I'm kinda confused to be honest. If she's your girlfriend why is there any need to ""act like friends""? You already are friends and more. Has her mother a problem with homosexual or bisexual relationships? That might be the first time I hear about someone having a problem with that but being fine with transgender people lol
Sounds like you two are teenagers? Your girlfriend is probably feeling a lot of pressure from her mom not to date you. 

You have some things to figure out: Do you want to continue dating this girl even if it means you have to pretend you're not dating in front of her family? Or would that be a dealbreaker for you?

From your response it doesn't sound like you'd be fine with hiding your relationship. Definitely talk to your girlfriend about how you feel about this!
Her mom is being really weird. Then again I don't get letting your parents manage your relationships unless you're a small child. This looks fishy af.
What‚Äôs most concerning is the mom is using her trauma to control your guys life, which isn‚Äôt fair because there could be a billion reasons why someone decides to take their life and potentially no one would ever know why they did it. 

Express that you feel like it‚Äôs unfair or weird for her mom to make assumptions about you based off of her past experiences. You can simultaneously be apologetic for the things they‚Äôve been through, but straightforward that you are a completely different person who shouldn‚Äôt be compared just because of one similarity. 

The mom isn‚Äôt being malicious necessarily, she could be genuinely concerned, but it‚Äôs incredibly over the top to think ‚Äúfamily member who‚Äôs trans tried to kill themselves, my daughter is dating someone who‚Äôs trans, my daughter is going to have to deal with her BF trying to kill themselves.‚Äù 

Be patient, maybe you say your piece and still act like friends for a little, but for long term to be successful you need to continue to have an open dialogue with the people in your life who don‚Äôt understand that well.
the phrase ""if I have somehow offended you in any way"" is so common and so annoying - it's such an unsubtly subtle way to defer blame onto the person being upset rather than the one who said it
This gave me bad feels and I know, for me, I couldn't help but be honest and say so.  Fuck bottling up feelings. I played that out and am over it. That's not to say you shouldn't take a moment to reflect and break down those feelings and the why of them, but after that just say it. I don't care if someone has a problem with my transition and I have no room for others laying their doubts at my feet like I should actually consider them. I have my own demons to wrestle, gtfo of here with yours. 

OP, if it bothers you, please stand up for yourself and don't let someone else put shame on you, ever. Girlfriend, gf's mother, anyone.  You deserve someone that isn't ashamed of you at any stage of your journey. üíú
Honestly I assume you have a lot to deal with right now, so ask yourself, do you need this? Is this environment good for you?

I know it would be nice to have a partner, but this girl can‚Äôt stand up to her transphobic mother, she‚Äôs letting her control your relationship so this affects you directly. Even if the girl means well, I don‚Äôt think this whole situation would add any benefits to your life.
Like....... are you not friends already? Why 'act'?
To help provide context, we‚Äôre both 17. I‚Äôve only met her mom a couple times and I get the vibe that she might be a bit helicopter parent like when it comes to dating. My gf told her mom I was trans and I think this is something in relation to that
This is a hard one, relationships are sometimes difficult no matter what, and while it could be very helpful during transitioning while in one, it comes with some interesting problems and situations.

But to me it seems you both are upset, which is understandable, she sounds anxious and/or worried about how her family would react, but at the same time you seem upset because you want to be accepted, both are understandable.

I‚Äôm in somewhat the same situation, my girlfriends parents haven‚Äôt been officially told I‚Äôm transitioning or that I‚Äôm dating their daughter, we‚Äôve dated in the past and have been close even in the interim, but her parents are quite religious and she wants me to try and hold off until she can move.

Personally I don‚Äôt have too big a problem with this, when I was first told it definitely bummed me out, especially since I‚Äôm an adult and was going to soon start to medically transition, so I‚Äôm just not gonna say anything unless I have to or until she moves out.

She herself is very understanding and helpful, she‚Äôs my rock and I love her with my whole heart, I try and tell her everything and we discuss things, we set clear boundaries and we talk about how we‚Äôre feeling or what we‚Äôre thinking, I think our relationship is definitely a great one, but like everything it‚Äôs not perfect, sometimes I feel sad I don‚Äôt pass or she ‚Äúcan‚Äôt experience it with a real girl‚Äù (internal transphobia I know doesn‚Äôt make sense but a depressed mind can run wild).

This whole post is a bit chaotic (most of my post are just stream of consciousness type things), but I say it depends, definitely 100% talk even if it‚Äôs upsetting you should be open about how you feel, and if you end up breaking up after that sometimes it happens, you still have a lot of life left to experience, but usually it‚Äôll only bring you closer together and you two will understand each other better. Also remember not ‚Äúpassing‚Äù or transitioning medically/socially doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not trans, you are who you are and you should be proud of that, just stay safe and be smart, do what seems best for you and your future, either way I wish you luck!
Your girlfriend should not have put her mother‚Äôs problems on you. Everything she talked about here is her mother‚Äôs issue. It‚Äôs not right to put any of that on you.
I mean she's just trying to be nice. But the suicide thing could be from many reasons, even if the person says why they tried to, doesn't mean it's true.
Anyway I'm sure she didn't mean anything harmful, and she's just trying to keep you without upsetting her family
Imagining if someone I loved said that to me, that because someone else did that after transitioning . . . I would feel weird about it too. 

We are all our own people. Yes we are part of various communities but we are also individuals and deserve to be treated as such. Everyone on this pale blue dot.
It's too small to be so ignorant and insensitive and the more we connect the smaller it seems to get.

I can't help but think her mother is saying you're Schrodingers cat at this point. Don't get attached to the cat that might be alive but might be dead? 

It's like she and her mother are both ignoring the fact you exist and have feelings and deserve love and respect.

That's what's weird.
That mother is definitely pushing her expectations on you! Don‚Äôt let them confuse you. üíö
Mother is trying to interfere in your relationship.

Neither of you should give her that power. It will only lead to further manipulation in the future.

She should make it clear that she is in charge of her own relationship. That she has faith in you and is on your side.

That said make sure to compliment here for being open and honest with you. Mental health is a valid thing to be concerned about but boundaries are going to be needed if your relationship is going to survive.
She wants you to pretend at be friends is weird in and of itself but I think we might be missing context. Did you two break up and it didn‚Äôt go well? Are you together but their parents don‚Äôt approve? Seems odd either way and definitely not really worried about you as much as appearances maybe? Need the context for sure
You‚Äôre girlfriend is essentially asking you to go back into the closet for her mothers sake. You have every right to not be ok with this and your girlfriend seems to know this. But relationships with parents are complicated.

If your a minor and your both living with parents this isn‚Äôt a good thing but semi acceptable as parents have a significant amount of control over their children‚Äôs lives. 

If you‚Äôre girlfriend is a young adult still living at home this is less acceptable and one of the many reasons to leave the nest but still understandable for the same reasons as if your girlfriend was a minor.

If neither of you are living at home this isn‚Äôt really acceptable and it‚Äôs time to start having conversations with your girlfriend about setting reasonable boundaries with parents and there ability to interfere in your relationship.

If you‚Äôre girlfriend is otherwise loving and supportive and this issue seems to be her interacting with an overprotective mother then give her some space to figure it out but absolutely talk to her about how it makes you feel and that you going into the closet for her mothers sake isn‚Äôt ok.
So she wants to hide your relationship until you've medically transitioned, your fine with your gender, you have no regrets. So when is that? 
I would be asking your girlfriend for a timeline (6 months, 12 months, 2 years)  of when she is going to start being open with your relationship because the timeline the mother gives is one where the goalposts can be moved at any time otherwise this can go for decades.
I will say someone who is in their 20‚Äôs who is financially dependent on parents kinda have to listen to them.
It‚Äôs about them in the way the girlfriend is handling it. The mom is just going to keep moving the goal posts if she thinks *she* gets to decide when OP is fully comfortable with their transition. It‚Äôs bullshit, and the gf is *defending* it. Which is the problem‚Äînot even the asking part is necessarily bad, but acting like OP should be ok with it and that her mom is justified is complete and utter bullshit.
It‚Äôs the more part that‚Äôs the problem. GF wants OP to pretend they aren‚Äôt dating in front of her mother, because OP‚Äôs mother is worried that OP will hurt themselves to death, causing emotional distress to OP.

Also, btw, OP identified in their post they‚Äôre a man, dating a woman so why would prejudice against homosexuality or bisexuality would even be relevant?
Sometimes it‚Äôs just the unfortunate circumstances of how you were raised. My wife was like this throughout her entire childhood; her mother was pretty manipulative and needed to be involved in *everything*. And if she argued her mother used guilt to make her feel like shit. Luckily, she was able to distance herself once she went to college. We still talk and hangout with her mother, but my wife makes sure to keep up those barriers.

Her brother though, not as much. He‚Äôs finally moving out now, at 25, but, up until then, he was financially dependent on his parents, and didn‚Äôt really have the capacity to disobey or stand up to his mother. He‚Äôs also gay, and while his mother is ‚Äúaccepting‚Äù, she‚Äôs not really that supportive. Like, telling him to ‚Äúnot act gay‚Äù around more conservative family members type of stuff. He‚Äôs a super sweet and kind person, so the guilt trips *really* have an effect on him because he hates upsetting people. 

I don‚Äôt blame him for ‚Äúletting‚Äù his mother be involved in things like this, because I know that it‚Äôs just very tough for them to break out of that cycle. Manipulative people can be very good at controlling people, and I try not to victim blame. I‚Äôm just glad he‚Äôs finally getting some independence.
yes, you're right. there are all different kinds of situations, i was making a blanket statement
I see.

I absolutely agree with you - the mother is not justified in any way, shape or form (is that a real expression?). There is no circumstance under which someone should be okay with this. 

However, unfortunately, there may not be another way they can act against it, if they want to stay safe together. There might, but we don't have nearly enough information to deduce that. Just going with it might unfortunately be their safest option.
That‚Äôs why I said that the gf asking wasn‚Äôt necessarily bad. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt judge my mom for it!‚Äù part that makes the gf kind of an AH in the situation. Because if she‚Äôs willing to dismiss/defend her mother‚Äôs actions in private to OP *now*, what else is she going to dismiss/defend in the future? That‚Äôs the concern I‚Äôd have.
yes, you're right again, though I do have a perspective to offer.

My mum isn't particularly supportive either, but isn't overtly against the LGBTQ, though she certainly doesn't like it much. I disagree with her on many fronts, but fortunately, she isn't forcing her perspective on anyone, not even us, her children, and I still love her as a mother, even if she isn't fully supportive (I of course understand when that isn't the case for other people, that's a given, but I just thought it'd be good to clarify). So I understand why someone might say ""please don't judge her for it."" It's not necessarily rational, but when are emotions ever rational?

"I have to ""clarify"" that I'm a girl because I'm closeted"	"Yesterday I was in school with my best friend and this guy comes up to me and asks ""I'm sorry, but are you a girl or a boy? My sister says you're a girl, but you're a guy, right?"" and it made me happy that OMFG I PASSED AS A GUY, HE WAS ONLY CONFUSED BECAUSE HIS SISTER SAID I WASN'T A GUY. I don't want my friend or anyone to know, and if I'd just told him, then he'd tell his sister who's friends with my sister and then my family would know. So I had to answer ""girl"". Then my friesn went on to talk about ""just because SHE has short hair doesn't mean SHE'S a boy"" and yes, that's true but she didn't need to say that and yes, it's not really her fault, because I haven't told her even when she's asked.

And whenever someone says HE or HIM people ""correct"" them. Which, yes, correctung someone for misgendering is a good thing, but it's just mad when I'm not being misgendered. It's all backwards and upside down. 

I don't know, its just so frustrating that it happens a lot. I have to say I'm a girl beacue people keep asking and I don't want to out myself. The people I don't blame for asking me is little kids, because kids are curious like that. But WHY DOES IT CONSERN ANYONE OVER THE AGE OF 10 WHAT MY GENDER IS???

TL:DR I have to say that I'm a girl because people keep asking and I don't wanna out myself and that sucks."	"I remember during my last year of high school when my hair was getting really long and people were noticing. I wanted to say what was up but I couldn‚Äôt. Not an easy place to be in.

‚ÄúAre you a boy or a girl‚Äù ‚Äúperhaps‚Äù is how I‚Äôd deal with it
That happened to me in my math class this semester. Literally everyone there used he/him pronouns for me even though when attendance was called for the first time I answered to my deadname, quietly, and no one noticed so I let them go with it. Best class by far
I feel you.

In my language, most nouns referring to people (especially jobs but also many others) have a feminine ending when referring to women or girls ut are otherwise generically masculine and I have that one friend who always corrects people who use the masculine ending for a female person. I appreciate him being against the generic masculine form of words and it's not his fault because I'm not out, but could he please stop correcting people when they refer to me with a masculine word?
In the future you can always just say 'it's none of your business'.
That sounds confusing and hard to navigate. I hope you can be out soon! It‚Äôs so unpleasant misgendering yourself.

Be patient with people‚Äôs curiosity and confusion. It‚Äôll wear you down so fast. I‚Äôm guessing you want to correctly gender others and to interact with them as they‚Äôd prefer. Some people will share that desire, and some people are taught to be assholes. It can be hard to tell the difference, but giving the benefit of the doubt can help you feel less surrounded by üí© people
You are who you are. People are like that. I‚Äôve been through many instances like that. I don‚Äôt have to explain myself, you can see I have boobs. Some people are just ignorant.
Yeah, I feel you. I just want to tell people now that I've  finally figured it out. But yeah, one day at a time.

Friend of 10 years misgenders me on purpose and gaslights me when confronted.	"Hi. So, recently, I started socially transitioning which has gone great! All of my family and friends have been supportive, with the exception of my one friend who I have known for around 10 years :(. We will call him Yarnld. So ever since I came out to Yarnld, he has treated me weird. Mind you, when I came out to him as bisexual a few years back, he was mostly supportive, just a little surprised, but nonetheless, didn't care. So, when I came out to him as MTF a few months ago, I thought nothing would change. Instantly, he started calling me ""ma'am,"" even in front of my family who I wasn't out to yet. However, Yarnld didn't out me. But as time progressed, he continued to treat me slightly weird. He continued to call me ma'am in a snide tone but yet he would still refer to me with he/him pronouns, even after I was out to my whole family and even his family. Over the summer, we did a few summer camps, driver's ed, etc. and he would randomly say to people at those places, ""he's a woman,"" when referring to me, but yet would use he/him pronouns (he even did this later to my very young little sister after I was out, further adding to her confusion). I tried correcting him once and he said, ""she, he, he, she whatever. You are a male anyways."" That was when I was really starting to be affected by his negative attitude. He still misgendered me, and when corrected, he would say ok and continue to misgender. One time, he was telling me about how he told his sister that I was trans. He said she didn't think I would ""be like that."" I know his sister didn't say that because his sister is awesome and progressive/woke. He most likely twisted her words and lied. After that he proceeded to tell me that there are only two genders. The thing that made me really mad and confused was that one time his mom misgendered me (on accident) but then pulled me aside after and apologized but then she told me how one time, Yarnld corrected her when she misgendered me at home in a conversation (again, on accident). Was he just torturing me for fun? I wasn't sure. 

This kept up until finally, the other day I confronted him through text and asked him to please use my preferred pronouns. He said he always does, which was not at all true, and when I said that he doesn't, he sent an empty message bubble and question mark every time I replied. I told him to stop trolling and he continued to gaslight me. I brought up specific examples and he defensively said, ""why didn't you say this the last time we hung out."" While this seems endearing, I can tell he did that simply to deflect. He said that this transition has been hard on him because has had to change the way he has referred to someone for 10 years (me ofc). However, he has never even once tried to properly gender me, unless he is trying to make a quip or snide remark, such as saying ""ladies first"" slyly and in a rude tone. He left saying he was going to the beach. While this breaks my heart, I don't think I want to continue my friendship with Yarnld. He is mean to everybody. He talks shit about people behind their back, even my own dad and my brother. And he is also a very big liar. Yarnld has become a very different person from when I first met him, and I think we have grown apart way too much for me to consider him a friend anymore. '

TL;DR: My 'friend' keeps purposely misgendering me and when I confronted him, he denied everything and gaslit me."	"I mean, yeah that's not a friend. Cut them out of your life and move on to better people. Fuck em.
It's the best choice to leave and don't look back. People like this will talk about others behind their backs and do the same to you. This definitely isn't a good person and karma will come bite him quick. Just drop him, ghost him if you want. He doesn't deserve an explanation and you sure don't owe it to him. Do what's best for you.
sorry but Yarnld in general seems not like a person *anyone* would like to be around (""he is mean to everybody"", ""he is also a very big liar"", WTF)? second the other comments, drop'em and don't look back. you need supporting people, not aholes
You have more patience than me. I‚Äôd have slapped him by now.
My advice is not be in that position anymore if they Aren‚Äôt  going to at least respect your decision about you‚Äôre sexuality, gender,etc.
Dump him, be friends with his sister.
ur friend is a bad friend
Friends don‚Äôt have to stay friends just because you‚Äôve known them for a long time
It sounds like he had something going on he's not taking about. That said your not a therapist is not your job to fix him. Let him know that you need some space, that your relationship doesn't feel healthy anymore. Make sure that he knows you'll be there if he needs to talk but unless he's willing to make some significant changes this is the end of your relationships.
I'm so sorry!

Gentle comforting hugs if wanted.

Hopefully your life will improve without that dude being so rude to you anymore.
True colors! Never Never trust someone like that again. We have all seen that! Be careful and Be happy.üåπ
That‚Äôs gross. Not a friend. You deserve better.
I'm just going to say the same thing but the season of Yarid needs to end some people are only in your life for a season and that's for the best in this case.
thanks everyone for the support! i think that i will try to drop him, as you all agree and that's what a lot of my friends are saying as well. i will try to keep yall posted but as of now he hasn't replied or reached out to me :/
I‚Äôm so sorry that‚Äôs happening to you. I think it‚Äôs best to fit him off tbh he sounds like a horrible friend‚Ä¶
Confront him in person and if he gaslights you even once dump his as
That‚Äôs not a friend. Dump them
i love this
üëÜ This is important
yes please!
i remember one of my favorite tv shows (atypical) talked about this and i very much love and agree with this.
I've never seen it but I'm hoping you find all the advice given here useful.  I've lost friends in life for various reasons sometimes it was a bad reason other times people just go in different directions and drift apart with no bad blood between the two.

friendly reminder: Link CANONICALLY is trans		"Yes and no.  It's a nice way to see it, but it raises the question about all the people that believe in reincarnation.  Are they all trans?  They believe that they have been reincarnating since the beginning of the human race, so most assuredly have been both genders at some point.  Does that mean all of them are trans?  This is fine to think in your head, but I don't think it's a label anyone else can apply to them but themselves.  Love the idea though, and I'll probably raise this philosophical question to my community.

"""You're too young to be trans"""	"I'm 13 years old, and I've known I was trans for a while now, and I'm so tired of people saying ""When I was 13 I was playing minecraft"" ""You're 13 you're too young to know that"" etc, I've known since a long time before I was 13, by 13 years old most trans people already know. Being trans isn't something I find enjoyment in and if I could wake up tomorrow and be cisgender I would, so I don't know why anybody would ever think I would ever want to look into a mirror and not even see myself or to feel as though I'm not me. I don't see why I should wait to come out and suffer through more years of gender dysmorphia. My gender dysmorphia is already bad enough with being out of the closet so I have no idea why people are mad I didn't wait even more years to come out. But apparently, since I know this at 13 even though the average person finds out before 13, I must be an attention seeker because apparently being trans isn't something you're born as and it's something that happens when you're an adult."	"As a 15 year old who came out at 14, I know the pain. It sucks to hear friends or family say that shit, but don't let it get to you. It gets better, you will be in a group that accepts you one day. Stay strong, DFTBA
Thats BS, you can know it that young. I hope you can convince them somehow
Ugh that's bs I didn't come out till 17/18 but I knew I didn't feel right in my body or gender assigned at birth from the time I was around 9  so yeah you're definitely  not "" too young to be trans""
So. You‚Äôre never to young to be trans. Some realize it a lot later, some realize it a lot sooner. For me, I think I knew when I was 12 but had internalized homophobia/transphobia so I stopped thinking about it, age 13 I fully realized but didn‚Äôt accept the fact, and then age 14 I‚Äôve come to better terms with it. You‚Äôre never an attention seeker when you know by heart you‚Äôre trans. Also, to make yourself better try to dress masc/fem (depending if you‚Äôre mtf or ftm) and when I tell you the gender euphoria is there! You aren‚Äôt to young and it‚Äôs actually amazing you realized it earlier!
When I was 13 I was ON minecraft pretending to be a girl
Bruh some four year olds know (and some people don‚Äôt realize till they‚Äôre 20, 40, 70, etc.) This is just part 273929294729 of cis people being ignorant.
There are several stages of personal development when it comes to ge der identity. Talk to any psych worth their salt and they can list them off the top of their head. 

IIRC, they are at four, eight and another one at 12-14. That's not to say that your gender will change at 14, it's just that you become aware of certain aspects of it for the first time (namely, puberty related). 

If a child presents gender dysphoria after *any* of these developmental stages it's very unlikely to go away.
Yeahh i feel this ive known i was trans since i was 12 (felt wayy out of my body since 9 but came out at 12) and now im 16 and people still say ‚ÄúwEll YoUrE ToO YoUnG tO KnOw‚Äù. Its balls oh well but it is what it is people just suck. You can prove them wrong though just stay tough.
I was like 11 when I started stuffing rolled-up socks in my tight t-shirts.  It starts when it starts and you know when you know. No one else is qualified to tell you who you are
As you I had 13-14 when I began to feel that I‚Äôm trans, couldn‚Äôt start transitioning until 26 because many factors. If I could turn time back I would have the courage to live as my true self from that age without think twice.
No cis person can understand how we feel or how dysphoria feels like, only you can understand your experience so yeah, you‚Äôre trans if you feels so and you should be free of start living your life as anyone.
It's really simple; If they can know their gender by that age then you can know yours.
I didn't know that people could be trans, but I remember around 10 looking at my body and thinking I should be a girl. I was really certain I was in the wrong body by 12. When you know, you know
I knew when I was 13 and I kept it inside for a really long time telling myself that it was just a medical problem and it would go away.

Took 10 years basically to accept it and it was an absolutely horrific 10 years. But, the moment that I had finally came out it was an absolute god send and it only solidified the fact for me that I should have come out sooner.

Even my mother said to me ""You should have trusted me and told me sooner all of those years you were hurting and let go alone"". I remember crying a lot when my mother told me she would have helped me every step of the way and currently she still helps me I am pretty close to finally stepping onto the path of HRT. Shouldn't let anyone stop you and its great that you haven't. Should be proud of yourself and keep your head up even when the weather gets rough.
I knew as a kid I ""wanted to be"" a girl, long before I knew what trans was.

When I was 3, I cried when I was forced a short haircut.  I wanted to be pretty, NOT ""handsome"".  I gravitated towards the girliest toys and stuffed animals.

When my cousin was 3, he was throwing Christmas ornaments at the wall, yelling ""BASEBALL!  BASEBALL!"" üòÑ  See the difference?

I never behaved remotely like a boy, and it's been that way since the start.  When I was really little, people thought I was a girl.  Actually, even in my teens and early 20's, people thought that, too, when I was deeply closeted. ü§îü§∑

If I had the language, knew about transition, and if my dad wasn't a bigot, I would've been insistent that I was a girl when I was little.  But 1. I didn't know it was possible, 2. Thought every boy wished they were girls, and 3. My dad would've popped me in the mouth and grounded me for all eternity.

So, I knew on some level forever.  It may have taken me decades to accept it, and for all the repressed memories to come back, but yeah, I was born this way.  I wasn't ""influenced by the internet"" (didn't exist).  I wasn't ""swayed by friends"" (they laughed at my femininity as is).  My mom didn't ""want a girl, so forced me to wear dresses"", or any other crackpot theory people have.  It's just how I always was.
you can't be ""too young to be trans"" if you feel uncomfy being your agab it's that simple. you're valid.
When I was 13 I was playing minecraft.... but I also knew I was trans. I think I started knowing I was when I was 11 or 12. But the signs go all the way back to my earliest memories. So yeah, people are stupid and you're valid.
Average age is 24 and considering how many 30+ yo trans there are logic would dictate that there are alot of younger transgender individuals
Your not to young I don't even think it's possible to be to young to be trans
I knew when I was 13, and I‚Äôm almost 16 and I‚Äôm still certain
You aren't too young to know. Keep at it and people will realise that you're serious, other problems may arise from that sadly. Luckily puberty blockers can be prescribed pretty early if you can get your parents to let you talk to a doctor about them, if you're concerned about that. And then you have a long time to convince everyone around you.

But more important than others is yourself, stay true to yourself and they need not concern you.
Hello fellow 13 year old. I agree a lot with this. We just don't feel ourselves love ling like our AGAB.
13 is around the time I started wishing I could be a girl. If someone had told me that it was a real possibility I would have jumped at the chance.
Age 13 is the most logical age to know you are trans!! Since your body is changing and your hormones change
People are never satisfied. If you come out when you‚Äôre older, it‚Äôs ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not really trans, if you were, you would have known when you were younger‚Äù. They move the goalposts to wherever they need them to be. 

It‚Äôs awesome that you figured out your identity so young. I‚Äôm so sorry that there are people in your life who aren‚Äôt supportive. You deserve better.
I started transitioning very young and my family got alot of flak for it, specifically my mom.

I'll never forget the nights I'd walk across my mom's room and hear her sobbing. I didn't know why back then, but I know now that it's because she was taking so much heat from our relatives. She wondered when I was younger if she did the right thing for me, because she just wanted me to be happy.

That's not the kind of emotion that transphobic parents are even strong enough to handle. So many of them are religious, and would happily have their child's body mutilated young for aesthetic purposes or to fit in with their cult, like circumcision or ear piercings, but cringe at the idea of, at worst, taking a gamble on their child's happiness. And at best, giving your child possibly the best chance at life they could ever have as trans person.
Some people know when they're as young as 6 and others don't realize what's up until they're in their 40s. Nobody knows what goes on in your head and body, so people who say you're too young (or too old) to realize you're trans are just idiots.
You are valid don't let asshats get to you <3 I came out at 9 13 is really not that young
I came out at 16 as trans and was told the same thing until I was 18. Idk for some reason people just don‚Äôt get it and think they know when they see the signs of a trans person or think that being trans is a choice.
i‚Äôm 22, i came out to my friends at 13 and my family at 14. let me just tell you this was the hardest and also the best choice i‚Äôve ever made. i started testosterone when i was 16 and got too surgery when i was 17. having support and being able to spend time where everyone is figuring out who they are to find my style and everything was an amazing experience and has helped me live a life i‚Äôm pretty satisfied with. do you always and screw anyone who judges you. most people saying that shit won‚Äôt be around when you‚Äôre older and get to choose the people in your life so try not to waste too much energy on how they feel about your identity bc fuck em
Had the same problem when I came out at 12 and everyone at my school said your to young, and it really sucks
Hey I came out at 14 too and I just turned 20. It gets even better lol üß°
Yeah I came out at 9 13 really isn't very young ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I‚Äôm 14 and preparing to come out to my first bit of family any tips?
Everyone reacts differently but for me I wrote my dad a letter but he would‚Äôve preferred I told him to his face. I told my mom in person too (they‚Äôre divorced.) Be honest and try to be patient. It‚Äôll probably take them a while to use the right name and pronouns- for them they‚Äôre just learning about this but for you, you‚Äôve thought about this for months or maybe years. Took my family two years to get good with name and pronouns and they didn‚Äôt like to be corrected so I just had to deal lol. But they should come around and it‚Äôll be worth it. (Though some people are just really transphobic, Hope that‚Äôs not your situation.) Sorry this is getting kind of rambly lol. Tell them your new pronouns and/or gender. Good lucküß°
Honestly, just, be very confident, please. I tried to come out at 15 after questioning for 2 solid years and got brushed off, then went into a nasty bout of depression. Please please please be persistent and confident in who you are <3
This too!

Don‚Äôt be twofaced. (Vent)	"TW: Misgendering. 

Respect me or don‚Äôt but don‚Äôt talk about me behind my back. I use He/Him pronouns and go by Ari. I‚Äôve worked at this store for over a year and been out the entire time. This isn‚Äôt new for anyone here. 

I found out two days ago from a coworker (we‚Äôll call her Lisa) that another coworker (we‚Äôll call him Bobert) doesn‚Äôt respect my pronouns whenever he isn‚Äôt in front of me. 

Lisa told me the conversation started when they were both closing, with him asking her if he looked like a liberal or conservative. As the conversation continued, he threw out a bunch of conservative views, and then threw me in as an example. 

‚ÄúFor example, Ari: I can‚Äôt look at her without seeing a her. I have a hard time remembering to use a different pronoun, she doesn‚Äôt look different. And besides, I don‚Äôt believe in that stuff.‚Äù 

Lisa to her credit corrected each pronoun and told him it‚Äôs a matter of respecting me and who I am, whether or not he agrees with it. He did not care. BUT to my face at work? Every day? He seems to put in a genuine effort. I‚Äôm mad and upset because it feels like he‚Äôs only doing so in public to not get in trouble or upset me. I know there will always be transphobes out there, and maybe I should be thankful that he‚Äôs doing anything at all for me even if he blatantly disrespects me behind closed doors. I dunno. All I know is I have a hard time looking at him right now.

Edit: spelling"	"Allies support trans people no matter what. He needs to check himself.
That sounds like an awful situation,I'm so sorry. Please confront him. If he is a genuine person,heb2ill apologise.
I think it would be better for both of them to report him to HR and let them deal with it. Employee confrontation like that seldom goes well.
True,honestly. Presuming HR aren't transphobic . If they are,then it's time for a lawyer.
Yep. I agree with you there."	ttsfoc	trans	81	0.94	2022-04-01 14:45:49
Amab trans woman struggling with male expectations pushed on me as a youth	"Growing up and as a young adult one of the things that upsets me and has angered me a lot is the idea that since I was born as male and seen that way by my phobic parents they sort of made me do things they would expect boys/men to. Like being physically tough, doing labor intensive work. It gives me mad dysphoria.

The weird part about this is that it almost sounds like I‚Äôm embracing gender stereotypes and gender roles but I‚Äôm not. After having to live with male expectations pushed on me for so long I personally would like to be treated as a princess, to be ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù, to not have to do grueling laborious work, to be showered with support/love/reassurance that I‚Äôm cared for.

Does anyone here relate or if not at least get what I mean?"	"I get what you mean, from the opposite perspective. It's not that I was ever treated like a princess, or expected to find a man that would - but there were expectations such as being the one that made dinner, keeping the house tidy and clean, have my job be pretty secondary to whatever guy I was with - it was truly an odd mix between parents wanting me to do good in school and getting a nice job/career, but at the same time be ""the wife"" - my (boomer) father pretty much lost it that I was away more hours than my then-fianc√©, although he was also the one that bragged most about my job. 

On the other hand, there was also the whole thing that it was my then-fianc√©'s job to do all the other hard work, men taking heavy bags from me, that sort of stuff. 

I've become pretty allergic to gender stereotypes, and learned to say ""fuck those, I do what I want"" long before I came out as transmasc. That doesn't mean that doing manly things can't make me euphoric though. They are just things I've wanted to do without it feeling odd or quirky or questioned every single time. 

I don't see it as falling to gender stereotypes as much as there is a reason certain things ARE stereotypes. It is because, if we look at the population as a whole, certain things, interests, traits, are just more commonly found in women than in men and vice versa. 

Since you are a woman, you are just *more likely* to have a desire for certain things that are considered typical womanly.

On top of that, we've fought tirelessly against these stereotypes for so long. They didn't fit us, they were wrong for us, or we wanted to be like the other side - conscious or not - so now that we allow ourselves to fully be ourselves and have fully stomped on all expectations that came with our AGAB - we just wish to go full out. We just have a lot of catching up to do.

If being spoiled is what you want, there's nothing wrong with that. It's not you embracing gender stereotypes. That's just you being you, finally, unashamed and unabashed.
A random older man helped me downstairs at a party I was just at. I was wearing heels and he held his arm out and offered to assist me down the stairs. I know I didn‚Äôt need his help, but‚Ä¶ I took his offer enthusiastically. 

I love being treated like a lady! It makes me glow. 

OP, I was raised to be the gentleman. I get it and agree wholeheartedly.
That‚Äôs the feeling most of us older ladies have, growing up with that era. Just be true to yourself and you will definitely feel better eventually. I know that I am finally finding my happy place after 40 years. It takes time and self reflection to get there, but it is truly worth it.
I think a lot of us can relate. You‚Äôre not alone.
I feel so much pressure all the time. I did exceptionally well in college and now also am getting promoted very fast in my engineering job. Everyone sees that and thinks I must be thriving to be able to so well but it feels so isolating to me. I‚Äôm struggling a lot internally and I cope by pouring energy into work and math problems so I can forget about my dysphoria. My psych says ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to believe you have anything debilitating going on‚Äù because my job performance is not suffering.

My roommates in college jokingly called me Princess all the time because I was usually late and people were waiting on me‚Ä¶ and deep down I loved it even though I was still treated as male. 

I have been literally begging people irl to listen to me and help me because I feel incredibly anxious and everybody just sees it as me opening the door to talk about THEIR problems because they think I can handle it and nothing is really bothering me. I want so much to just be treated like a girl and have emotional expectations where I am believed when I say I‚Äôm stressed out. Everything is expected to be my responsibility as a ‚Äústrong man‚Äù and I absolutely hate that.
Your trying to chase after any and all femininity after being denied it for so long, not surprising to see happen.

I am sortive had that issue but nipped that thought in the bud by reminding myself my sisters were all tomboyish like so no need to be something I don‚Äôt need to be, can be happy being a tomboy like my sisters if need be.

Then again‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt stop me from getting dresses and wanting more so idk>.>
I get what you mean but I‚Äôm the opposite, I am a trans man and I was lucky to find my soulmate he loves being spoiled, and I‚Äôm happy to let him stay home to be a streamer while I‚Äôm the bread winner.
AMAB agender queer here.
I've embraced my ability to do it all. It has nothing to with gender for me, it's just my ability to learn tasks and compete.
I'm tall, thicc, femme, and strong. Most people have no idea what to call me.
I too crave the soft things, someone to cuddle up with, someone to treat me like a queen and tell me everything is alright.
Baby it's what we all want. You're not strange for wanting it. It's human! We all want someone to take care of us, to pamper us, to spoil us with the things that make us happy.
You're a powerful creature of incredible potential. Embrace it all!
I only recently realized that I‚Äôm trans at 30 after missing all the signs growing up. Yes, I wanted to not do guy stuff. I never longed for girl activities because I wasn‚Äôt exposed to them
There are already a lot of great responses here, but absolutely! Personally, I can 100% relate to what you described. When I was younger I fulfilled very masculine roles and engaged in ""manly"" norms. I did tons of labor for my parents and employement, I played heavy contact sports in school, my roles in relationships was always the stoic caretaker. My hobbies and interests were typical of masculine individuals my age. I know where you're coming from and how that can feel. It's really hard to shed those expectations, ESPECIALLY when they're internalized and coming from inside. You can't just ignore a rude family member or rando at the store, it's you.

Remember to show yourself kindness, give yourself time to reframe those internalized expectations, remind yourself that those messages aren't true for everyone, and you'll be right as rain, girl. Wishing you the best üíõ
I feel the same- I used to think I hated formal environments, then I realized I wanted to be in dresses and treated chivilrously. I was raised as a ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äù to, expected to be manly and stuff. i get it entirely.
I was AMAB and didn't figure it out for almost 28 years. Since then, a big portion of my life has been spent finding thing after thing that I had no reason to believe or support except for societal pressure and general opinion. The amount of positivity I've discovered and self-improvement I have made on both my body and mind has been staggering in perspective to those first 28 years. When you encounter something that makes you upset, ask yourself if you are thinking or doing that thing because society wants you to or has just taught you that things are just this way versus you actually wanting to do the thing. Re-examine aspects of your life and values and choose the ones that create the most happiness for yourself. Worry about the happiness of those around you after you have taken care of yourself.

Stereotypes exist for a reason and are not automatically bad. They are bad when they are used to mock someone or something such as a culture but stereotypes used in their literal sense often reflect some level of popular opinion or preference. After exploring myself have found many things that are female stereotypes that have brought me amazing Joy. There's no reason not to enjoy something just because it is something that stereotypical girls do. Do what you think is right and what feels good to you short of directly harming someone else. And remember that even though many of the haters cry that we are ruining them, their way of life, and their values, you are not causing anyone harm because they can't accept you for who you are.
The amount of stress and anxiety I had about portraying myself as masculine literally ate away at my body. The 2 years before I came out I had constant tension headaches, I had lost over 60 lbs (200 to 140 lbs), I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I had a seizure, and my muscles started to atrophy to the point where I couldn‚Äôt lift more than 40 lbs

Once I came out and stopped pretending to be masculine these things quickly went away.
I absolutely relate. Unfortunately, my apartment complex does not, so off to work I go
Yes!  Honestly I was taught to open doors and let women, children and older folks go first.  I was taught to be a leader, be loud and heard, to make my presence known, to be strong, and show no fear.

As a trans woman who has been out a year and is a technical lead in the workplace.  Some of these lessons have turned me into a very strong leader who is highly respected.  Other parts absolutely destroyed and confused the woman inside of me, and made it so much harder to come out and finally transition.  Fortunately emotionally I have gotten over many of these weird lessons.

But I have to say... its still really weird when I insist an older gentleman go first... and they ABSOLUTELY insist that no I have to go first, or they have to open the door.  Its so affirming but so weird for me still!
I relate to that a lot because I was raised by mormons. I was literally sent to gender brainwashing camps with strict sexist segregation. It really made me feel like I had to be a girl in order to have access to all the things I enjoy. I felt guilty about wanting to be the kind of woman I was and I found 2 things that helped me out a lot. I found that separating my feelings of wanting to be a princess from my gender was really helpful with dysphoria. I want to be who I am, as a woman and not that who I am is because I'm a woman.
And knowing that tons of ciswomen everywhere look for the same kind of attention as I'm looking for and that it's our responsibility as women to let societies image of us affect us as much or as little as it needs to, to go live in this world.

Knowing both of these things helped me embrace my femininity and even made me more comfortable doing traditionally masculine things without dysphoria. It gave me a whole new perspective as to what nonbinary people might experience the world like too. I started identifying as more of a demi-girl femby now that I'm confidently feminine in my own style.
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm an older lady. But I‚Äôm 27? I of course get that for most people under capitalism, everyone has to work for a living. That‚Äôs not a gendered thing..But that‚Äôs not what I meant. I was talking more about like the type of work I‚Äôm expected to do.. does that make sense?
I‚Äôm envious ü•∫
Yeah.. I still have to work to pay my rent unfortunately  because capitalism.. but at least the job I now work at is not like a typical male expected labor intensive job in the hot sun that always left me exhausted all day that I was expected to do before when I lived with my parents. I know if I was afab I would not have been forced to do that while living with parents.
Like in other words I of course understand that almost everyone has to work‚Ä¶ but I was more talking about the type of work‚Ä¶
Thank you everyone for the beautiful responses and validation. Love you all üíù
Totally makes sense. I‚Äôm actually looking at changing careers from my original career due to not being comfortable in that environment any more. But I already was looking at changing careers before my egg cracked."	y8vtde	trans	78	0.97	2022-10-20 11:35:30
I deserve to be happy, no matter what	"Yesterday I texted my sister and I came out as trans, she proceeded to have a meltdown and said things like: 
""I've lost my sister""
""I never wanted a brother""
""I never want to hear from you again""
""I hate you""
""I hope your happy!"" (In a sarcastic and degrading way)
""She's changed""
And a lot of other bullshit. I've had enough. She has emotionally abused me for all my life and I've had it. I've reached a breaking point. If she doesn't want a brother, fine by me. I'll just cut her off. I never wanted a sister as selfish and manipulative and vindictive as her but that's I got anyway. You don't choose your biological family. But I'm not going back in that closet because she wants me to be someone I'm not. I don't care what she says to me, she's not going to bring me down and stop me from being happy. I still care about her though(god only knows why). I haven't changed, she has. Mad doesn't even begin to sum up how I feel, I don't even want to see her face or hear her voice. I just want to be happy, I think after everything that's happened, I deserve it. We all deserve to be happy. She says she wants nothing to do with me, fine. All she's doing is making my wedding cheaper."	"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre sister is like that. Sending love and support üíïüíï

The Trans Rollercoaster	"Don't you get that feeling? Like one day everything is so perfect and euphoric, but then, the next day you stare into the void and just want to give up?

I have, a lot of times, and damn, is not good.

I've tried a lot of things to feel better, but the closet is too small to do anything, and still, the idea of ""I feel good, so, everything will be OK if I just come out"" makes me feel secure, but then you peak a little and the things you hear and see are so wrong that you fear for your life?

Why is it so wrong? Why is everyone so mad? Isn't supposed to be my life? 

You know, I know, we know.

This is hard, this is truly the hardest step in our life.

I just want to tell you that you are not alone. That I'm proud of you because I know how this feels. I don't care if you don't want to transition, or if you have doubts about to start your process, even if you are fully happy with your transition. 

I really don't care, because you're a human, just like me.

And as a little human in this huge world we call home, even if we are miles or continents away, I love you, and I want to hug you until we both cry, because you need it, because I need it, because we need each other. 

I understand that this ride is terrifying, but there is no reason to close our eyes and not enjoy the emotions it brings. Even if they make us feel happy, sad or even angry.

I'm so pissed that, even if I go private I'll have to wait a whole year because I need to be on testosterone for a year to be eligible. I've been out and presenting as male for 2 years. My gender identity is stable. Why is there a time barrier for a surgery that would make me able to look at myself and live without hiding under a hoodie even in the middle of a heatwave ? My dysphoria is ""unusually intense for my age"" yeah no shit, it's fucking unbearable but I'm 16 so I guess I'll just have to endure one more year of this.

Same goes for my gender marker. Can't change it until I'm 18 even with a medical certificate that attests that I'm fucking struggling. But no, cis man said to wait so I shall obey. What a fucking joke. I feel like bureaucracy is stealing my teenage years. I just want to be happy god dammit, I'm tired of having constant reminders of how wrong my life is and will be for the next few years when it took me so long to even get my family to support me.

I know some people have it way worse but fuck this shit."	"There needs to be laws from adults forcing their religious views on others by making their beliefs law.  Oh WAIT it's call separation of church and state.   Apparently some adults are just too forking stupid to read our pre-existing laws.

As a trans guy in the exact same position, heatwave and all, I'm really glad that someone mentioned how frustrating it is. Dysphoria fucking kills you from the inside and people are still going off about 'irreversable mistakes' even though that '''''mistake''''' could save someone's life. I wish I could help but I guess all I can say is keep doing the things that make you feel a bit better about dysphoria, dpn't be shy when correcting people, even if they pretend like it hurts them and you'll get through
I feel this 110%. Im 23, but couldnt start transitioning until I turned 18 due to very transphobic parents, so I totally get just how a w f u l it is having to live with the dysphoria and being deadnamed when it could all be very easily be fixed if the right people were decent human beings. I am fortunate to live on the west coast and we havent had much activity in terms of anti trans legislation in my state. But I am still devastated when I find out another state has banned trans athletes from school teams or not allowing trans kids to transition etc. It is f u c k e d up and I am so sorry that you, and everyone else being affected by these transphobic pricks, are having to struggle to survive more so than usual. Also, there will always be someone who has it worse, but that does not mean that your experiences , trauma, and emotions arent valid. They are and it is entirely reasonable to be pissed and scared and any other feelings. I shit you not, my daily mantra is just "" I hate people"" followed by internal screaming constantly lol like, why cant we just simply fucking exist without some asshole trying to strip us of what f e w rights we have?! Im not going to say it will get better, bc its a ""thanks im cured"" response and I cant promise that it will. What I can say though, is just take it one day at a time. Try to immerse yourself in hobbies, friends, games anything to distract you from the shit that is happening. I honestly didnt think Id make it this far, but I did, and you can too. Your community is here for you and just know that us trans adults are doing what we can and fighting tooth and nail to protect your rights and the rest of the trans youth in our states/countries. You are not alone ‚ù§Ô∏è
Some people have it worse, but it isn't easy for anyone. You are completely valid in your feelings. The trans community is/has being targeted by American politics. It's impactful and extremely hurtful.

It's all a distraction too. The people who are doing this don't actually care about trans people (in a positive or a negative way) it's all just stepping stones to their next goals and next surge of power. 

If you take away trans rights, then it's easier to take away women's and POC. Slowly moving towards fascism.

Stay strong it can change."	vyp8c3	trans	78	0.97	2022-07-14 06:38:20
Family member mad at me for correcting them when using my old pronouns	"I recently got the courage to correct my brother and mother when they accidentally used my old pronouns and name. And I thought that was a good thing. But just now my brother got really angry at me for correcting him because of how it hurt his feelings. I tried to explain  (pretty badly, honestly) how it hurt when he used my old pronouns and deadnamed me, but he began yelling at me, which made me cry... My mother, who stepped in, told me off as well about how I didn't consider their feelings enough in this situation. 

&#x200B;

I feel so hurt and betrayed. I generally believed they understood what I'm going through. Or did I do something wrong? I don't understand at all. I feel so alone. I'm sorry for my rant, I just really needed to tell someone."	"This is toxic behavior.  They are deflecting blame rather than take responsibility for the pain they cause.  This doesn't just happen in isolation.  People who have a problem taking responsibility for their actions will often deflect onto others.  How do they react if any mistake or error they make is pointed out to them in general?  My money is on something similar.  

My point is, this is less likely to do about you, than it is about them not being able to cope with potential failure.
I understand what you're going through. Just stay strongüíñ and remember that they are the ones being selfish. Deadnaming someone on accident can pass for me. But once start doing like you don't care about me or my feelings. It's definitely toxic and not kind of you're mother and brother.
bro fuck him !! I‚Äôm so sorry to hear this happened
I don't empirically know, but I bet stuff in this article could help: https://www.iflscience.com/how-to-talk-to-a-conspiracy-theorist-65766
Sounds like fairly childish behaviour at best, narcissistic behaviour at worst (I mean from your family, not you).  This isn‚Äôt about them.

Ask them how they might feel if their name was Richard and you started saying ‚ÄúHey Dick, what‚Äôs up Dick?‚Äù  Or really any other name they don‚Äôt like or go by.  It would be annoying at first and then just feel downright disrespectful if it kept happening.
Sorry they have the emotional maturity of childrens. You can really do anything about it. You could try buying them a children picture book that specifically address that you should admit your mistake and not make it about how your mistake cause you pain instead of considering other's pain.
My brother deadnamed and misgendered me constantly. I started to misgender him I each time he did it to me instead of correcting him. It stopped him in his tracks.
Screw them families suck
Hey! You didn't do anything wrong at all. Correcting pronouns is just fine and normal, and it isn't hurtful at all. When I get corrected, I just correct myself and move on, as should anyone else. I'm sorry you had to deal with that and that both your mom and brother did something like that! Total dick move to deadname/pronoun someone and get mad at *them* for it. It is TOTALLY  good thing to correct people on your pronouns! Your life should be comfortable for you. Stay strong, and just a reminder that you're valid and so are your real name and pronouns! Don't let them bring you down<333
""I'm going to say things that hurt you, and then I'm gonna complain when you object to it."" - your mom and brother
No contact don't speak  to them or answer them.
I would also be mad, holy wow
Is there any way for me to help them? I really want them to understand me :(
So she can dish it, but can‚Äôt take it. Typical.
The fact that they got upset and blamed YOU kinda makes me skeptical that they would even be interested in learning or understanding. 

An emotionally healthy person doesn‚Äôt blame someone else when THEY make a mistake. They own it and say something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I forgot,‚Äù and not, ‚ÄúLook what you made me do!‚Äù

That being said this a great video for explaining gender from a scientific standpoint: https://youtu.be/uLcIbjgnGlQ
It sounds like they are actively trying their hardest to intentionally not understand.

You might be able to get through to them, but it doesn't seem likely.

Time to get an air horn and blast it every time they missgender and deadname you.
You did nothing wrong‚Äîthey‚Äôre being petty and butthurt. Tell them exactly how you feel when you‚Äôre deadnamed/ dead pronouned in writing maybe and that when you‚Äôre correcting them it‚Äôs you just trying to feel like yourself, not some kind of mean reprimand. It‚Äôs not about them for godsake, it‚Äôs about you! (Might not include that last bit, lol) Just say you really want them to understand because it means a lot to you.)
Exactly. She said to me, my dead name is my legal name so he was can use it. I legally changed it and called her/him to say you can no longer call me deadname. I was about to write him off but he came around. He occasionally slips up but makes an effort now. 

I don't get it. We've always been close and he's a compassionate guy but he hurt me over and over. We are beyond that now but at the time, it really sucked!
End of the day, they are very disrespectful to you.
He was. But over time, he stopped. He never apologized. Some day, I want to ask why he treated me that way."	y50goh	trans	72	0.96	2022-10-15 22:26:34
My heights killing me? (Possibly triggering?)	"I'm 13 and Trans-Masc. My height really pisses me off, I'm 5'0. I can't tell you how much I hate my height and it's really knocked down my mental health. I don't what to do. People have told me to just live with it but I don't think I can. It feels like my height could be my only masculine quality at this point. I have no idea of what I'm even supposed to say or do. People even make fun of height which has made feel so shitty it's not even funny. 
Does anyone have any recommendations about how to feel better about myself? Or even raise my height up? I'm sorry if this is a bother. 

Edit: I feel like I should zoom in fact that I can't live with it. My height feels like a constant burden that I can't shake off or change. Being told to live with it is something I can't handle. It's driven me to the point of madness and that all I'm ever told."	"You're 13 you'll probably get taller.
It's not a bother. Just remember that at 13 you're still growing- you're already taller than I was at that age! I won't make any claims as to how tall you'll end up, but just keep in mind that nothing's set in stone yet.
My trans masc boyfriend is 5'2. He's still absolutely rocks my world and I see him as the manly beast he is. Short kings are totally valid!!!
I'm a trans girl and most men from my country are shorter than me, I'm just used to cis men being short at this point haha.

So you're not alone in being short, however you stated that you're 13...you'll probably grow to be taller than 5'0, so no worries!
To be honest, when I was thirteen I was only about 4' 1'', but I'm older and I'm 5' 4''ish. You'll most likely grow a fair bit as you get older. 

If it gets you upset, know there's lots of short kings such as Danny DeVito and Joey Jordison and you're just as legendary as they are
Start developing skills that take advantage of your height. After you learn of your advantages in those activities, your height won‚Äôt bother you, because you will accept it at some point. You will definitely grow taller, from 13. But start researching the lifestyle that promotes height increase: food, exercise, and activity‚Äôs. You got this.
As many people have said, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll get a bit taller still! However if you don‚Äôt (I‚Äôm 18 and 5‚Äô3ish), height can fade out of view as you get the freedom to express yourself in other ways. Once you reach a point where you feel comfortable in how you dress and act etc, height becomes less significant honestly. Does get me down a bit sometimes but you will grow to be comfortable with yourself. :)
I've known many short guys over the years. Killed their mental health as well. But you know what, people come in all shapes and sizes. It's a part of nature.
I know ADULTS who are cis-masc and 5‚Äô2 my friend, trust me, there are SO many short guys out there and your height doesn‚Äôt make you any less masculine! Forget those people who make fun of your height, they don‚Äôt know anything! Then again you are only 13 like everyone has said so I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve still got a bit more growing to do!
You‚Äôre only 13 you‚Äôve got more growing to do so give it time
Dude I feel you. My hight has just stopped. Right now I just wear boots that have a platform and some heel, or some low key heels. 
   I‚Äôve heard if you get on testosterone before your Groth plates finish you MIGHT get some extra hight but that‚Äôs a big might. 
   And set some clear boundaries about hight jokes. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve had to do.
As someone who has very insecure height issues, You‚Äôll just have to figure out how to live with it‚Ä¶.

You‚Äôre going to find this funny, but I‚Äôm on the completely opposite spectrum. I am MTF and 6.5 ft tall. 

9 times out 10, I am the tallest person in the room. Which means everyone knows when I enter a room, always! And is even exaggerated when I wear any kind of heel‚Ä¶. Which I‚Äôm actually doing today. 

And the reason I can wear that heal today is because the attitude I woke up with was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a fuck‚Äù, and on the rare occasions you wake up that way, you just own that shit!!! Hard!!! 

I can‚Äôt pretend to know what it‚Äôs like being short, but I can tell you that feeling like a freak goes both ways! 

One of the most common things that people do to me is ask me to get things from the top shelf for them‚Ä¶.. as a way of explaining why that makes me feel like shit, I will say things like,‚ÄùI don‚Äôt ask you to pick up that thing off the ground cause you‚Äôre closer‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Anyways, find your way to fight the system. in your way. And that will help a lot‚Ä¶

God speed! I hope you are able to come up with the best ‚Äúfuck you!‚Äù That you‚Äôre able to implement as you walk through life‚Ä¶.
You're definately still gonna grow!!
You're already taller than my husband! 
He's short and slim, but nobody would ever question he's a man. 
Perception of gender has almost nothing to do with height.
34yo trans masc here, I'm 5'3"". I'm so sorry people are being shitty to you about your height, that's awful.

I know it's frustrating, but give it time. 

I know that at 13, I was shorter than I am now, because I still had a growth spurt to go before I hit 16ish and stopped growing.

As to ""only masculine quality at this point""; maybe, but again, as time progresses, you'll get other masculine traits. If you decide to go on HRT and end up taking testosterone, for example, you may gain height! You'll likely also get masculine traits, too.

As to ways to help, posture is a good one, good posture can make you seem taller than you are, and bad posture makes you seem shorter.

Also, how you carry and present yourself, and how you present yourself. Like I said, I'm short, but people think I'm taller than I am because I give off a ""don't fuck with me"" vibe. I'm not a jerk, I'm not rude or an asshole to people walking around, I just... I know my capabilities, I know what I want, and I take no bullshit.

People think my partner is taller than he is, because he almost oozes confidence and security in himself. If you project ""confident"", people will unconsciously think you're taller than you are. (Bear in mind, because a lot of young men and boys (like my brothers, for example, lol) get them confused for a while; there's a difference between ""confident"" and ""arrogant/being a dick"".)

There are apparently shoes that can ""lift"" someone to make them seem taller, but honestly, I wouldn't suggest those; they scream ""insecurity"" to many people, and there will be jokes about them, because some people are jerks.
I have no help but I hope this brings a little comfort:

I‚Äôm 16 and 5‚Äô0. When you get older most people get over their height crap. Sure I‚Äôm small, and sometimes my FRIENDS will make jokes but strangers stopped giving a crap and grew tf up.
im 5'1 and rly havent grown a lot since middle/high school. i used to have a lot of height dysphoria and yknow things like lifts can help and stuff, but honestly i think just knowing that sometimes people are short just helped me a ton. 

did you know youre taller than danny devito? everybody loves the guy, nobody ever misgenders him or calls him effeminate for being short, hes just danny devito! short guy extraordinare! i know at this time it seems absolutely insurmountable and youre going to die unhappy with your height, but bro its a non issue when you start being able to pass in other ways
You'll probably get taller, also short cis guys exist.
Pffff, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 barefoot and I‚Äôm definitely taller than most other women and a healthy portion of men. While your height may feel like an issue right now, nobody will think twice about it unless you bring it up. I have a (cis) friend in his late 30s who‚Äôs only 5‚Äô0, and he‚Äôs an absolute king.
One of my trans guy friends is 20 and he's only 5'2

Personally after turning 13 I grew like 3 more inches. I know that's not necessarily encouraging but I'm saying you're not done growing yet
most people already told you this but you will definitely grow, but i understand that it is still a bother so i will suggest that you get height add ons to your shoes (i think i saw ones that could give you like +2 inches or something look that up!

Also i would recommend you started practicing sports cause that might help you grow taller as you are still in growing age
I‚Äôm in a similar situation, I‚Äôm transmasc and due to an eating disorder, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0 and not growing anymore at 15. 

Honestly I get dysphoria from it too, and I don‚Äôt know if this will help, it might not, but there are SO MANY cis men that are 5‚Äô0 and under, and absolutely nobody questions them being men. They‚Äôre still men. 

Hey you‚Äôre doing better than Danny DeVito and he‚Äôs beloved by all

Also if youre 13, it‚Äôs very likely you‚Äôll be taller, and one of the most influential people in the world to me is 5‚Äô3, he‚Äôs trans, but I would not be able to clock him, he‚Äôs super manly and he‚Äôs an amazing person.
You‚Äôre taller than Danny Devito, and he‚Äôs as manly as they come. Also you‚Äôre still a kid, you‚Äôve probably got some more growth in you.
Thing is you‚Äôre probably still growing and lots of men are short I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 myself and I‚Äôve met plenty of cis guys who I tower over still, height varies so much by genetics I‚Äôve met men under 5 foot and women who were 6‚Äô6 it‚Äôs the wonders of human diversity.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm ftm, 28 years old, and 5‚Äô2‚Äù. Since being an adult, no one really comments on my height. Sure I wish I was taller, but some things you just have to accept. Luckily for you, you are most likely not done growing. If you can get on T soon, it may help you get slightly taller than without, so long as you‚Äôre still growing, so I‚Äôve heard.
well first of all you will probably grow taller, and secondly i suggest you buy some kind of platform boots even if they dont have that much of a platform (mine make me 2 inches taller, and i would like to add that i count fairly tall for a masculine presenting person, but i also have very tall boys/men surrounding me)
Amab here who was literally only like an inch taller or the same at the same age soo
I‚Äôm also ftm and not in love with my height but I just got some sick platform boots that give me an extra 3 inches. I would highly recommend getting some shoes that give you a boost! I know shoes can be expensive but I‚Äôm pretty sure there are also inserts that you can put in your shoes that can give you an extra couple inches!
You still have so much growing to do. Adult height is strongly correlated to good nutrition, so eat your veggies and focus on health and you‚Äôll get there :)
Transmasc here, I‚Äôll be 21 years old in less than a month and I‚Äôm 4‚Äô10. You‚Äôll be alright kid.
I‚Äôm not going to say that you need to just live with it‚Äî but a perspective shift may help. That‚Äôs the pressure that all ‚Äúshort‚Äù men have subjected on them by society. It doesn‚Äôt mean being tall is inherently masculine, but people with crappy opinions will still try to assert that being short isn‚Äôt manly.
The most masc thing to do may be not needing to address your height. Be a kind six footer in your head and just live life that way. The older you get, people will be forced to treat you the way that you carry yourself.
MaB trans fem here, well, when I can finally start transition anyway. Bud, I am 5 '2"" at 31 years old. You are ganna grow plenty tall and fine <3 stay healthy, keep your calcium up, and you will do fine.
Ear plenty of vegetables and leafy greens  mixed with high protein! You're still growing for sure! I bet you hit a growth spirt pretty soon!
13 I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much. How tall are your parents? Plus, one of the inherent challenges of being trans is wrestling with what you wish you were. Transitioning can help a ton, but there‚Äôs a ton of six foot plus t girls dealing with the flip side of the same coin.
My boyfriend is 21 and 5‚Äô2‚Äù so I understand a bit of what you‚Äôre going through, they make height increasing insoles for your shoes and platform boots could be affirming, other than that it would be down to HRT or genetics
1) you will probably grow a bit more since you're only 13

2) some people experience getting taller even as an adult once starting T (personally have a friend who grews 2""!)

3) lots of men--both cis and trans-- are around 5'0

4) our wonderful elliot page is a staggering 5' 0.5

5) these short people benefits: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/benefits-of-being-short_n_5798d6d1e4b01180b5311a93 

6) short kings rule üëë

7) i hear you are struggling severely with your mental well-being because of this. Please try to reach out to a trusted adult to talk about how you're feeling. Ive been in herapy and counselling for several years and highly recommend it to anyone who can access it. Having that space to be fully honest and fully yourself with a trusted professional can make a huge difference. There are also places online like the Trevor project and 7cups (among thousands of other options) where you can chat about how you're feeling. 

I know just how heavy it feels to carry the sort of feeling you're having. The years 12-15 were some of my hardest personally. I recommend blaring your favorite music as loud as you can and throwing yourself into whatever hobby you love. Remember, it gets better. Some things are cliche precisely because they're true. Sending love to you, ma dude ‚ù§

Edit:spelling

Edit 2: also, my 25yo bf is 5'2 (and has a bit of a baby face) and gets half-priced tickets and food at a lot of places by claiming to be under 16. He's a total badass and I love him. üòÜ
You‚Äôre 13 and not done growing. 

My roommate and I are trans men who did not start T until after age 25 and both gained 3 inches despite both having fairly severe scoliosis.
The average height for a 13 year old boy is only 5 foot 1. You should get taller anyway.
There are short guys out there, I know a guy who's 4'6 at 15. Don't stress too much about it at the moment, you'll continue to grow
There‚Äôs always platform shoes! YRU shoes is expensive but high quality, and they have some more masc designs. Some shoes are taller than others but you‚Äôll gain 3-6 inches of height depending on which ones you buy.
One of my friends at school is a 16 year old cis guy and he's about 5'1-5'2, if that's any consolation. 

But for actual advice, maybe look into platform shoes?
You are 13 so it's very possible you will continue to get taller. In the meantime, platform boots help a lot.
make sure you eat heaps if your hungry your body cant grow so if your body doesnt have the materials when a growth spurt happens you will miss out
I relate; trans-fem and 6‚Äô2‚Äù
I don‚Äôt know your economic status, but if you can afford pilates that can add to your height. It‚Äôs not like, a TON, but between giving you better posture and literally stretching your spine you might get an inch or two. 

But also, love short kings. My favorite ex is shorter than I am (he was like 5‚Äô2‚Äù) and rocked it. My least favorite was like 6‚Äô3‚Äù. He was a compulsive liar. Shorter dude was more feminine in dress (he‚Äôs bi) but also in character, much more manly. So seriously, people really do feel the impact of your personality WAY more than your height.

Also also: platform shoes and lifts exist. Pay attention to shoe quality and support when choosing!! They CAN screw up your back and posture if not well made/chosen.
If it helps at all my almost 15yo brother is hardly 5‚Äô
Hey, if it helps, I'm 16 mtf and 6'2. I really hate my height too, not even just because I want to be shorter cause I'm trans, but I'm also just unusually tall. Like I stick out because I'm usually the tallest one in the room and it's the worst.
The good thing about your situation bro is that you‚Äôll probably be growing soon. But here are couple options for you possibly‚Ä¶ 
There are shoes and/or  inserts for shoes that can give you a 1‚Äù, 2‚Äù, 3‚Äù boost I‚Äôve even seen some inserts go as high as a 5‚Äù boost. 
But the free option is to fucking own it bro, just because you‚Äôre 5‚Äô doesn‚Äôt make you weak, less masculine, or less desirable. So pick your chin up young man. You got this!

Side note: Whatever vibe you give off is the vibe people receive and they will treat you based on that. So if you want people to treat you a certain way, you gotta treat yourself that way first.
I‚Äôm a tall trans girl. The height dysphoria experienced is on the opposite side of the spectrum but oh so real.

I don‚Äôt know how to help but if it means anything  I‚Äôve met some short af dudes that are hella awesome. Height has zero to do with healthy concepts of masculinity. Heck my friend in High school was 4‚Äô-10‚Äù was the singer/guitarist in a band (was really good too.) and now runs his own mma gym and fights featherweight matches that are absolutely brutal. Damn cool smart af dude. 

Short guys exist. You got this. I believe in you.
You‚Äôre 13 and definitely still growing, even if you don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt let it get to you, you‚Äôre still a teen and will find your place with your gender yet.
I had the same experience as you at 13. I did not get much taller (about 5‚Äô2 pushing it) but you might grow still. I‚Äôm 22 now. 
I still get upset about my height but people generally do not clock me for it or have anything too negative to say. 
About my own self, it is definitely difficult to be a short man. But this is true of all short men. It helps me to remember that nearly every feature on my body there are at least a handful of cis men who also have it. Cis men get gender dysphoria too it‚Äôs just not really spoken about. It takes years of living in the world and building confidence but I hope for you to get to a point where you can not have to think about your height so much. I try to focus now on what I can change. What I can do with my lifestyle or surgery. To hurt because of something unchangeable is just torture to me. Good luck. You have a lot of life to live in your body, I hope you can shape what you can to what you desire and come to accept the things you can‚Äôt.
You‚Äôre almost 100% not done growing. I know it can be hard not thinking about your height and how it compares to other people, but I urge you to try and focus on the fact that you‚Äôre still growing. Let your body finish before you bully yourself over it. I know it‚Äôs hard, but focusing on the positive (for example, that you‚Äôre still growing) is better for your mental health, so try doing that.

When you feel yourself beginning to think negatively, try to pull yourself away from that thinking by reminding yourself of the good things. :)
Hey, im also not as tall as I want to be but what helped me was that a fellow Volunteer  firefighter who is a cis male is the same hight as me and we're both fully grown.
So cis men can also be short and a lot of people like short kings.
And besides that you are probably gonna grow more so don't worry to much!
HGH?
Your growth plates don‚Äôt fuse fully until your 20‚Äôs so there is the chance to grow taller. As far as how to grow taller there isn‚Äôt much you can do other than hope you‚Äôre a late bloomer, or look into starting testosterone.
Are you on puberty blockers?  My son is still on lupron.  We‚Äôre hoping he‚Äôll have a growth spurt once he can come off next month.
amab here

at 13 i was probably 5 feet tall, or close to it

now im like 6'2

dont worry, youll get taller, especially so if you get on t, but dont worry if you miss that time frame, tbh i think youll be about as tall as a cis guy if ur 5'0 at 13
I'm trans mtf , 15 years old and am 6,1. This brings many tears to my eyes

I was 6‚Äô-1 1/2‚Äù by 16. Tall trans girl high fives. 

I‚Äôm 37 now. Going with a mentality of being a badass like Wonder Woman/Diana Prince, Samus Aran, Sigourney Weaver and Gina Davis just to name some tall badass girls.
Thanks!!! :D
Thank you :)
Thank you!!!
Thanks :D
?
That's pretty interesting, I've wanted to start T but I'm not out yet. Thanks :)
I am not.
If you like girls, teenage me would have LOVED smiling up at you and snuggling and going all protector mode if anyone dared make MY girlfriend feel any less than the delicate darling she is! 

Pretty sure I‚Äôm not the only one out there. 

Please be kind to your spine and don‚Äôt slouch to make yourself look shorter!
i personally LOVE tall girls. my gf is 5‚Äô11 and i‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 ish. tall = more to love üôá‚ù§Ô∏è
I reached my full height at 19, so the process can be slow depending on the person!
I didn‚Äôt do shit. It‚Äôs all you.
Us short kings gotta stick together. My height bothered me for a little while too, but when I figured out I wasn‚Äôt going to grow anymore, I really had to learn to live with it. I knew I was trans from an early age, and although I didn‚Äôt understand height dysphoria at the time, when I stopped growing in the 5th grade it felt bad in a way. But having not grown since the 5th grade, I‚Äôve had a long time to come to terms with it. I know right now it seems insurmountable, but you‚Äôll come around.

Yesterday my dad (who‚Äôs usually supportive) told me that I should concede on the issue of trans women in sports because it ‚Äúhurts the trans rights movement‚Äù	I was trying to explain to him about how Kaitlin Jenner is transphobic even though she‚Äôs transgender herself, and I brought up a lot of issues the trans community has with her, including her opposition to trans women in sports. My dad said he thinks it‚Äôs best for trans people to concede on that issue and focus on more important things. While I agree that things like healthcare are more important, banning trans women from women‚Äôs sports is still discrimination. He also deadnamed and misgendered Kaitlin the whole time even though I repeatedly corrected him. Even though I hate Kaitlin Jenner it‚Äôs still wrong to deadname and misgender her. Now I‚Äôm rlly upset and kinda mad at him but I don‚Äôt wanna talk to him about it bc Ik it‚Äôll just make me more upset. I felt so unheard and now I feel like I don‚Äôt trust him to support me as much as I did	"Sounds like he doesn‚Äôt understand that it will not end with sports. They will use it as ‚Äúproof‚Äù to say we are  too dangerous to be around cis women, and call it basic biology.
You are obviously completely correct about trans inclusion, Jenner being shitty, etc. I would just remind yourself that its super unlikely your dad will change his mind no matter what you say on this issue. Sometimes people have to compromise in order to maintain a relationship; sometimes people choose to end relationships. That decision is up to you.
Never give an inch. It took no time at all to go from sports bans to health care bans.
He, like many moderate people, doesn't understand how bigotry works: let bigots discriminate an inch, they'll take a mile. 

It's not even something little, it's destroying trans athletes' careers because of ignorance and fear.
Jenner is not the messiah of trans people. Most of us hate her.
People still watch sports?
The dad might be a fan of Kaitlyn Jenner. Sounds like it, at least."	ueud69	trans	69	0.96	2022-04-29 20:07:22
My trans flag. My mom and sister got mad at me for having it. I‚Äôm sad boy now :(		"Don't be sad its a very nice flag  be proud of yourself üòòüòç
I can't fathom why someone would get upset because you have a flag.

Sillyness.
Keep going my dude I wish I had a trans flag!
Keep being you and knowing that the community supports you!
Your very welcome

I had a trans flag too but i lost it... i swear i feel like my mom took it away from me somehow though.
Thanks. :)
My mom yelled at me for wanting to be a boy and having that flag.
:,)
I know that it's usually a knee jerk ""I want to protect my child"" response.  Not that that makes it right or helps in the slightest.

All through life no matter what you do there are always going to be people who want you to be something that your not.

The only thing you can really do though is be true to you.  And keep looking for those that will share it with you. 

Your already stronger then many for going against the grain. And every time one of us do we make it better for the next person after us.

Rant: My 12 year old sister-in-law's Christian school outed me to her without her parent's permission. Now they're mad at me and ignoring her.	"So my in-laws are either pretending like I'm not trans or trying to figure out if they will tolerate me, at best (mtf). They opted to not tell their youngest daughter anything, who is 12. I am ok with this decision because she's a child who's probably never even heard the word ""transgender"" and it's their call to begin with: I have no say in the matter.

Well, she just got pulled out of class the other day and taken to a private meeting with the school counselor and principal where they proceeded to show her a facebook post I made, coming out,  from a while back. It is public information so I'm not upset that she is aware now, but they didn't ask the parent's permission!!! They just informed them afterwards of what they had done, plus they told her mother, who is by far the one most un-okay with me. From what we can tell, they were trying to ascertain whether my 12 year-old sister-in-law is ok with this, as if doing so means they have been led astray from God.

I'm just baffled that how I feel should matter to anyone enough that they approach a young lady, with massive changes and issue of her own to deal with (think puberty, boys, trying to fit in, cliques, social pressures, etc.) and they did it without permission. All of it just to see if she has been their version of right and wrong at home. She won't talk about it but everyone can clearly tell she's not handling it well and my in-laws are now mad at them but getting to that point where they are thinking stuff like ""this is all HIS fault, and we'd be ok if it weren't for HIM"". My mother-in-law being who she is, now has trouble hiding from the fact that I DO exist and so she's taking it out on her daughter now instead of confronting me. \*\*Note, she's always been like this and it's not physical but she puts her down emotionally and holds her there in a pitiful attempt to feel better about herself\*\*  


It's not even a religion thing- I am a Christian and proud of it- it's a boundaries thing. No one has the right, private school or not, to do this to a child (especially if it's not yours). Now, even though I have done what was asked by my in-laws while they needed time to process it, I'm getting cornered and even worse...they are not helping their daughter with knowledge, love or compassion, regardless of how she feels about me. Like I said, UGH!"	"Damn. Thats majorly fucked.
I can‚Äôt believe that. I really can‚Äôt. How could a private school gain any information on someone to know that a relative is transgender? That has to be the sickest thing I‚Äôve read. I‚Äôm so sorry.
Yeah that's really fucked that the school did that without permission from ANYONE involved. I must ask for some context in how they knew to look through your Facebook though? Do you pick her up or anything. I just don't get why the school is even stalking you for ANd THEN has the audacity to out you.
I cannot see any posts y‚Äôall make lol
Wow... that stinks from all the kinds of places...

And you said you can't talk to your sister about it? Maybe help her to go through this?
This sounds like some kind of small town cultist bullshit. I would do anything I could to read them the riot act, show up to a school board meeting and lay into those nerds.
I don't think it's okay to reveal other's intimacy like that. You should be respected, regardless of who you are. It's never okay to do this kind of manipulation.
I mentioned on another comment that we think someone who knows I have a connection through family, to her, either found out and showed the school directly or told their kid and the kid talked about how they know someone in school related to a trans person. 

Again my sister-in-law won‚Äôt talk about it so it‚Äôs just eating me up that it happened this way
So we can‚Äôt tell how they found out. We think someone who knows the family and/or me made the connection and basically tattled.

I‚Äôve never even been to the town her school is in. Keeping in mind it‚Äôs in Dallas/Ft. Worth so there‚Äôs hundreds of places I haven‚Äôt been.
They should be visible now.
I‚Äôve reached out and told her I‚Äôm here to talk but to at least communicate with her parents. She just says she‚Äôs not ready which I understand. Her parents will NOT let her talk to me about it though, especially when they are like 80/20 that it‚Äôs ok.

Found out further, while my wife and youngest daughter were at a family gathering last night at their house‚Ä¶the entire family ignored my wife the entire time.
I wish but it‚Äôs not worth it probably and would just further reinforce their beliefs that they are right to disapprove of me
Something similar happened to me on a more personal level. I came out to my mother in law and she promptly told people without my consent. It was a betrayal on so many levels it hurt. I didn‚Äôt want to come out to her. I was asked by my partner. I wanted more time. That lead to issues at a church I no longer go to. It turned into a whole thing. I am still so sorry.
Oh wow that's even more fucked up, and honestly at this point there has to be something legally wrong with that???? Like holy shit I hate the private school system so much in America it's either religious brainwashing or pay to play education when it comes to private schools the ones that aren't for religious nuts are too expensive for the average household and offer better opportunities for those that can afford. (Which isn't a problem except for the fact that people want public schools to disappear and actively short the public schools) edit: just saw the comment about your wife going to a family event that also sucks major ass"	ukshf1	trans	71	0.94	2022-05-08 02:47:03
my university deadnamed me in a professional induction ceremony‚Äînow i‚Äôm mad.	"tw // deadnaming

hello all!! last semester, the university of south carolina aiken held their induction ceremony for the school of education‚Äôs professional program. i was deadnamed in front of my peers, my professors, and the administration. i was blatantly lied to about the reasoning for it, and though they asked for suggestions on
how to prevent it from happening again, no changes have been made. i have checked. religiously.

today i decided to take to social media about it, since obviously the university isn‚Äôt doing anything on their own. i know it‚Äôs not much, and i understand the impact it could have on me, but i am so tired. between this, the open bigotry of some of the students and faculty and the school newspaper making a joke out of accommodations for disabled students for april fools, i am tired.

it feels like a win, speaking up about it‚Äîeven within my small circles on facebook and twitter. i‚Äôm not hopeful that anything will be done, but i do want people to be aware of how little this school seems to care about trans students.

hope everyone has a fantastic day. you‚Äôre all loved, you‚Äôre all amazing, and i am proud of you üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

I'm really sorry about that. Sounds like it's not a very progressive college... Which you would kinda hope it would be considering it's ""teaching the next generation"" and all that.
Hey, I went to Clemson, and can honestly say this is the reason I avoided going to graduation - I didn't want to be needlessly deadnamed in front of my peers. Even though I updated my name in their system, all of my teachers still saw me as my deadname, so I had to get deadnamed on the role until they learned my name. SC schools are horrible about this, despite a few individuals being supportive. Just know you aren't alone. Call the shit out when you see it, we need brave people like you.
this is something i‚Äôm very interested in doing soon, if i can find a paper willing to do it!! tysm for the suggestion ‚ô•Ô∏è

Am I exaggerating?	"My boyfriend just showed me an screenshot of a conversation with a friend. His friend is FtM and his name is Eric, but my boyfriend has him with his deadname. I asked him why he hasn't changed his name yet and he's like ""... but it's weird to me. I don't like Eric either"" and I'm so mad now.

I told him that for a trans person is like a punch on the face being called our deadnames and that he should change it beause it's not that hard nor his bussiness, but he's just joking or saying that ok, he'll change the name but that I should know that he's uncomfortable with it.

I'm also FtM and I know he hasn't changed my name yet. Sometimes he show me screenshots with my fucking deadname there and it hurts but he doesn't seem to care.

Now: am I being too dramatic? I'm mad and sad now...

(Also idk if i chose the right flair, sorry if not)"	"You're not being dramatic.

Even if it were something frivolous (it's not), him continuing to do something that he knows bothers you is selfish and entitled, and it's unacceptable in a relationship.

Adding on the fact that it's related to your and your friend being trans, that's like deliberately poking someone's open would.

And the ""but I don't like Eric"" bit: the fuck dude? Do you just call people whatever name you like if you don't like their name? ""Hmmm no I don't like Daniel for you, I'm going to call you Gary instead"". You don't get a say in this.
Throw the whole man away
It doesn't matter if you're ""uncomfortable"" with someone's name, it's their name. If you really can't stand saying it it's on you to come up with a suitable nickname.

If I were in your shoes I'd drop him like a bad habit, but that isn't always a great first option, if you would like to *try* to get through to him you could always straight up sit down and tell him. ""Hey, you're being super disrespectful towards the trans people in your life. If you keep this up I'm promoting you to single."" Or if you're feeling a bit more passive aggressive, come up with a nice fem name for him. 

I'm sure your boyfriend Diane would *love* getting the script flipped. 

Also, 100% let Eric know what's going on. Just try to reach out to him in a respectful manner about it.
not to be blunt but dump him. There are folks out there who will see you as you are.
Drop him that is unacceptable
You're not overreacting. One of the first things my friends and family did was change my name in their phones - without being asked to. That's just basic respect honestly.
You're not being dramatic. That he can't do something as simple as change a contact name shows that he doesn't care about you or his friend as much as he cares about the mild and temporary discomfort of getting used to seeing a new name.
He has little respect for you or trans people in general. He is showing you who he is. Do with that what you will.
Based off the snapshot uve given of this man he seems to be an absolute cunt that has no respect for your identity or your friend's. I dont like to assume I know people without getting the full picture but this alone would 100% be a dealbreaker for me. He sounds abusive as fuck please for your own wellbeing leave him
Yeah that's insensitive, and degrading so idk why he would think it's ok. It's like common knowledge imo.
You are in the right here, he is being shitty and transphobic.
Ditch the bigot.
Based on what I'm picking up, does he see you as a guy? Like if asked would he say he was in a gay relationship? If he's not honoring your name I'd probably find out if he's honoring your identity at all.
You are not.

My ex did similar things to me. Constantly misgendered and deadnamed me. Her family did the same, despite me being out to all of them for a couple of years. Not once did she correct them.

I seriously regret staying with her despite that, or not even having a serious conversation with her about it. I didn't see it as a red flag at the time, but it's an absolutely huge one. People like this rarely change - so ask yourself, how long do you imagine yourself being with him like this? If he never changes? 

I know its scary as hell to lose someone close to you (I've never managed to break up with someone lol) but please do consider it. You deserve someone way better. And he does not deserve your attempts to make him a better person (especially if he isn't actively seeking that.)
If he‚Äôs uncomfortable with changing your name in his phone, he does respect you as a man, that‚Äôs it.  I‚Äôd be curious to know what he says to his friends about you, or if he sees himself as queer now that you‚Äôve transitioned.
Start calling him by increasingly girly names and say that you didn‚Äôt like his name. You aren‚Äôt exaggerating and I advise you dump him if you can‚Äôt get him to respect a NAME. You don‚Äôt want it getting worse
If I were Eric I'd be super uncomfortable seeing this post... 

I don't think you're overreacting but I do think you should take Eric's dead name out of your post.
What a pig. You deserve better than a pig.
You may be being over dramatic, but I‚Äôve lived with a TS person for 24 years, every time she‚Äôs misgendered or misnamed, I see a little sadness in her and I don‚Äôt like that. Just so you know, it‚Äôs almost always her family that does it
yeah the 'but I don't like Eric' was shit. Even he mentioned names that he would like more, like ""James"" or ""Ethan"". Aah anyway...
Right in the gahbage
:::((( i'd love him to be like that. Or anyone of my family
Yeah, that's transphobia right?
I don't really know if he sees me as a guy... i can't tell bit maybe a little bit. I don't think he's a terrible person, more like he's pretty stupid. Who knows
Pretty sure he calls me female, and I think he's even more uncomfortable with thinking we're a gay couple. Before coming out to him, he always called me his ""girlfriend"". Since I came out he only tells me ""partner"". Damn im sad
Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. Usually I just stand but yesterday I was quite disappointed. My biggest impression of him was always that he was a kind and respectful person, but... aah
If I'm reading the post correctly Eric is the friends(ftm) chosen name not their deadname. OP did not deadname Eric.
I know this is petty and wouldn't solve anything, but I would change his name in my phone and make sure he sees it. If he asks why just say you don't like <his name>
Gentle question here: if he's not like that is he worth dating?
Correct. I don't care what his excuse is, there is zero reason to not respect someone's name.
I keep thinking of you and your situation, I hope you‚Äôre doing okay.
Yeah, everyone is respectful enough but not him. Anyway I think I should talk with him and being a little more specific... to see if there's something to do here-
i don't know- i mean i love him but hmm. Maybe i have to think about it a litte
We talked about it. It's a little better now, actually-
I'm sure that you do. You also deserve better treatment than that. This is obviously one tiny snapshot of your relationship and I have no idea what the whole picture looks like. Maybe it's actually nurturing and amazing - only you know. But if you feel at all like you're settling, or like you're dealing with things that are harmful to you because you want to preserve the relationship....I don't know, I'd just think about putting yourself first. Because if this person isn't willing to love you the way you love them, then go find someone who will. They're out there.
It‚Äôs possible to catch feelings for almost anybody. Serial killers have female admirers .
That‚Äôs a testament to you being a loving person not necessarily him deserving your love. Trust me I‚Äôve given so much love to so many people who showed no basic respect for me. It never gets better if they don‚Äôt do it if their own accord you can‚Äôt fix someone. You can only be patient for someone who treats you as well as you treat others and that‚Äôs hard. Let the rest go and make someone else unhappy.

I came out to my friends last night and they were all so supportive, a bit to supportive actually	"so i was at school with them today (obviously) and they were all so great and used my name and pronouns and everything, one friend, i'm gonna call them John, was a bit to suportive though, i know it sounds like i'm being really picky, and i know im lucky to have suportive friends, but i mean i had specifically asked them to used my dead name and she/her pronouns in class, but instead john decided to corect all my teachers and tell them, very loudly that i was trans and that i went by Alec now, oh my god it was so embarrassing, i'm not out to my parents yet (they're super transphobic) so now i'm super scared that the school will accidentally out me to them, i got mad at john for doing that and they were so confused as to why i didnt want the school to know yet, they have super suportive parents and dont understand why mine might not be, its just, i thought john of all people would understand and not out me (they're trans too) i'm just so frustrated right now, and im mainly frustrated at me for being frustrated, ugh why does it have to be so hard

Update:

i talked to my teachers and they've all (accept my English teacher) agreed to use she/her pronouns and my dead name for my parents, i'm super woried about my english teacher though, shes a very traditional christen, and knows my parents from church, i'm worried that she'll tell them, i mean on the bright side, at least i dont need to come out at school now. i also talked to john, but  he just doesn't understand where i'm coming from, i live in a generally accepting contrary, and almost everyone here is accepting of the comunity as a whole, and he thinks i'm just overreacting, and that my parents would be acepting if i just told them. i guess he didnt grow up being lectured about how trans people are ""abominations"" and ""sins against god"" and that how if any of us (my brothers and i) went down that ""misguided path"" that they would have to kick us out, because they couldnt be ""harburing fugitevs against god in their holy house.""

God im so scared"	"Hello Scott,

It is understandable that you are scared to be outed to your parents.
I think you should talk to your friends about it, especially to John. Tell them the truth about your fear with your parents.
You better also communicate with somemone who you trust at school. It can be a teacher or someone else. Tell them what you told us, that you are scared to to be outed to your parents and you don't want that the school communicate to your parents about it.

Wish you the best!
Congratulations for coming out, and in my opinion what John did was disrespectful, to me one of the best things someone can do is let you come out to people when you are ready, unless if asked to help.
Firstly, congrats on coming out! That‚Äôs a huge step. While John may feel they were being supportive , they were actually being the opposite- blatantly disregarding when you told everyone to use your deadname in class. You‚Äôre absolutely not nitpicking, I‚Äôd be furious too. They need to know exactly how you felt- humiliated and scared. Not gonna lie, assuming everyone else‚Äôs parents are not transphobic shows a huge lack of awareness. Honestly, tell them that their actions could have directly put you in danger of harassment/bullying. If they‚Äôre a good friend they will see your point of view and apologise. Also, if you are concerned about your teachers accidentally outing you I‚Äôd recommend having a convo after class. It‚Äôs uncomfortable but they already know you‚Äôre trans, no thanks to John. Hope things get resolved soon.
Awwwww. I just came from your last post you made before coming out, I'm really happy for you that your friends are so supportive.

And ik what having transphobic parents is like, hope you get through this without anything too bad happening
John may have his heart in the right place, but what he did was cross a very hard boundary of yours and he disrespected you a lot. It is only on OUR terms that we come out. It is important to make sure he is aware that even though he doesn‚Äôt understand where you‚Äôre coming from, it‚Äôs not his responsibility to figure it out, but respect it and ONLY respect it without any ‚Äúbuts‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat-ifs.‚Äù This might be an important lesson for him. Look up how to properly set boundaries and reinforce them with friends. It is the most valuable skill you can learn, especially at your age. It will put you well ahead of your peers if you put the time in.
thats the thing alice, i did exsplain to my friends why i didnt want the school/my parents to know, and they did it anyway, i dont know if he did it on purpose, or just like wanted me to feel uncomfortable, idk"	umb8lp	trans	62	0.96	2022-05-10 05:27:35
I think my husband is an egg, what should I do?	"I've had a suspicioin for a while now for a while but tonight was a bit different. He was high and called me a good boy (I'm trans so it means a lot to me) and I called him a good boy back but accientally started another thought. I tried to cut myself off but my husband wasn't having it. I finally finished the thought, ""You could be a good girl if you wanted to be."" and said that i didn't want to say it because I was afraid to hurt or offend him. He said that it actually made him feel happy to hear it. I convinced him to get into a girly outfit and let me do his makeup. He liked it and we started trying on different outfits that would fit him. He said that he always like wearing dresses and heels but didn't because his cousin made fun of him for it. We found a bra of mine that fit him and we stuffed it and put him in a dress and he liked it. He said that he liked the boobs and so kinda said a leading thing, ""Feels like they always should have been there, huh."" He agreed but I don't think he really registered it, he sounded distant. We talked about buying more female stuff that actually fit him and maybe even getting breast forms.

&#x200B;

If he isn't trans he's definitely not as gender confirming as he wants everyone to believe. He's admitted it himself, when he's high he's his heart and when he's sober he's still himself but with all the mental barriers that he put up to everyone and to himself because of his upbringing. So, while I didn't expect him to be okay with the good girl I decided to take the opportunity to do something that I wish I could have been done for me, a gender affirming makeover. I don't know, I feel guilty about it at the same time.

&#x200B;

EDIT: He's sober now and he's not mad. He's open to exploring this new side to him. I'm so happy!"	"Just be supportive and loving like you are
As with any other egg, you leave it to them to figure out.  In some cases I might suggest discussing [The Dysphoria Bible ](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) (in your case perhaps what helped you realize) but the prime directive still applies, eggs must crack on their own, only you determine if you are trans or not, and you shouldn‚Äôt do anything that makes your spouse feel that they are being pushed towards the idea they are trans.
Too cute!!! And what a good girl ;)
Just support them, and see what happens?
If it's something he struggled with and repressed, then having you not only be supportive but encouraging could do him a lot of good. At worst, it's a healthy exploration of another side of him you two were able to bond over.
Absolutely nothing, bar supporting them and loving them.
You sound like an amazing guy and your partner is lucky to have you!
A similar thing happened with me and friend group at ohayo con. I dress as a ‚Äú crazy anime girl.‚Äù I said somethings that rise some eyebrows. A couple of friends were going to ask me. Another was like no you‚Äôll wait until she‚Äôs ready. 
So they just made a safe space for me. A few weeks later I came out to them. I hope this helps.
Yay! :) happy that he is not regretting exploring that part of him. I repressed it for years and now I‚Äôm regretting not getting started sooner. He‚Äôs lucky to have someone like you in his life! Good boy!
You leave hom alone. Nothing is more annoying than someone who thinks they know you more than you know yourself.
I have a feeling my husband is on the same path. Until he says one way or another I‚Äôll still use he/him for him. Maybe he‚Äôs just gnc, you know? But it‚Äôs still nice that I made a space safe enough to explore his gender it shows how much I have helped him.

Cis people hit on me and then get mad??	Okay I know that there‚Äôs the whole thing with cis people not liking trans people but I‚Äôve been having the opposite problem?? Like they will hit on me and then get really mad at me when I don‚Äôt like them back? Like since they‚Äôre cis I‚Äôm supposed to like them or something? It stresses me out though because they‚Äôll be mean and/or try to get other people to hate me when I don‚Äôt reciprocate.	"bruh cis ppl are so entitled sometimes oml. they act like they‚Äôre doing us a *favour* by being interested, like we‚Äôre their little charity cases because we‚Äôre just that unlovable in their eyes istg
r/niceguys
I think they think you should be thankful for their interest because most people aren't into trans people (not true but that's what they think).

Kinda like when they hit on fat chicks

And then since we're lowly fat/trans people it is a huge insult when we reject them because we're supposed to be desperate
They probably expect you to be grateful for some narcissistic reason. Hopefully the next person that hits on you, is much more respectful.
Some ppl have a really big problem with reject.
It probably stems from some cis people either
1. Seeing us as a group that is ‚Äúundatable‚Äù and therefore desperate for attention, making them upset when we reject them
2. They see us as a sex object, so when we turn them down, our ‚Äúuse‚Äù to them is over and they can be rude and entitled

That or they‚Äôre just someone who‚Äôs really upset and gets really toxic at rejection; either way it‚Äôs best to avoid those people ü§ï you deserve better!
Had the same problem, i dated a cis male and after a few dates he literally put his hand in my pants infront of people i know.
I told him before i don‚Äòt do that bc at that point i haven‚Äòt had my grs yet. I told him after that i don‚Äòt wanna meet up anymore and he told me that i broke HIS heart and that he loved me still even tho we met like 4 times or so
Um cis people/cis men have a hard time with rejection.
don't forget r/nicegirls
Thank you
The idea of being undateable makes me laugh. Trans women get flooded with offers. More than your average cis woman. They‚Äôre just mostly from people too embarrassed to admit what they like to their friends and family.

All seemed okay, I was open about all the steps with my mom and her parents (basically all the family i had that cared any more). Then is April this all changes... I talk to my mom about messed up anti-trans propaganda I saw and she DEFENDS them. Like yeah, she is Right-winged... But seemed fine to let people be who they want. But not me. Freaking 5 years later she tells me it would be hypocritical to treat me as her son and that none of my family owe me the moniker of a male. I try to dispute with facts and she just goes silent and says nothing for a moment before fueling her own agenda. She ""apologizes"" if she hurt my feelings but I told her that wasn't at all what she was doing, told her she was denying me any semblance of human rights and respect. We stopped talking after that... I didn't talk to any of them, not mom, gma, or gpa. 
Then I get birthday/Xmas cards (bday is the 15th) and the outer envelope from my grandparents says Carsen and I am actually hopeful. I though ""hey, maybe they are trying and wanna talk or even apologize for real"" ... Then the cards that regarded me (because i also live with my gf) have my dead name and they say ""you girls"" on the Xmas card. 
Like?! Wtf? Even for MY BIRTHDAY you won't even try?! Wtf? Does my mental health not even matter? Ffs... All I have is an estranged ""cousin"" out of all my family. I am freaking livid. And then how freaking passive aggressive my card was?! My gf gets this short and sweet card and actually tells her to have a good bday and I just get this condescending card. So yeah, they dead name me - maliciously - and use the wrong pronouns after 5 years of knowing. 5 years of talking about taking T, talking about surgery, my beard, etc... 
But no... Not for me, I'm just the family punching bag. Like, none of them are the (no offense) out of touch type. They are relatively young, like just barely 60s and my mom is in her 40s. But like anything regarding my mental health has been shat on by these people, even when I had a mental breakdown and begged to see a therapist or be put on meds. Why did I even hope they would change? Why did I think they would care that much about me. All they want is to trash talk me and then say good things to other people to save face. 
Honestly I just feel angry, betrayed, and used."	"[deleted]
I don't know if it is possible for you right now but maybe it would be best to cut ties with them
You have every right to feel angry.  Just because they are your family doesn‚Äôt mean they get a free pass to be vile.  No one needs that kind of torment from people who are supposed to love you unconditionally.

If I were in your shoes I‚Äôd cut them out of my life entirely.  I don‚Äôt have the time or energy to try to fix people who are so far up their own ass that they‚Äôll never change.  Especially when they seem supportive and then do a major 180 like that.  Fuck that.
I'll say this about the right wingers, they only 'act' amicable to trans/lgbt people to their face. Conservatives are a no shit cult, they're treating you like this because if they don't they'll be ostracized, not that I'm defending them at all, that's a condemnation. You're their son, you should come first. 

You deserve to be Respected, it costs them nothing to use your pronouns and name. Send those letters the fuck back with the deadname crossed out in red. Being angry at literal betrayal is perfectly understandable. You shouldn't have to prove anything to anyone to be respected. If they aren't worth it, they aren't worth it.
It would be hard not to be mad about this. I'm sorry you're going through this.
I am so sorry. No matter what course of action you pursue, the pain our family of origin inflicts upon us is very hard to heal. I do think this may end up with your best choice being to go no contact with them to protect yourself.  I wish I thought differently, but I know a lot of people who have transitioned, and by the five year mark, the family has usually come around. It‚Äôs disturbing that they are still being so obtuse after all this time.
If I read this right, they put your preferred name on the envelope and your deadname in the letter??? If I understood that right that's downright malicious
Hey there OC, you have all my empathy... I had to learn for myself that I can't fix people and I know how hard it is to let go, but after what they did, misgender an dead name you and stuff, it's probably the best to just never talk to them again...
:(
I know it can be hard to let go, but if it's better for you and your mental health just screw it. You can do this. ^^
Lol, I actually like that but the personal envelopes were inside a bigger envelope that had my preferred named... So, it was kinda like a trap. :\
I am thinking about it. I told myself I would not initiate contact and just wait and see what they do. Problem is... They do nothing. No calls, texts, apologies, etc.... They treat life normal and expect me to reach out. So, there seems to be no benefit to what I thought I should do. They don't even wanna try to see what is wrong. 
I already cut ties with so many people... The rest seems so isolating and hurts a bit.
Thanks and yeah, that is kinda what it is. Like when we all first talked it was jokes and fun. Like my grandparents seemed cool with it if bot also a tad concerned. My mom was more serious and was concerned with every regarding it. Then, this year they all decided to show their true colors and be as I have said.
They are not amicable to me or my gf when it comes to me. Saying that I'll never be a man, but to other people, oh no.... They'll apparently discuss me as a man and go by my chosen name. But to people who matter to me? Nope. To my friends, my partner, me? No screw that. 
But like.... They met a trans woman named Carrie that moved out there and talked to her about me. Regarding me as trans and so on. So when I told her how they treated me she was shocked (I met her on fb after talking to another LGBTQ woman from my home town).
My mom was apparently perfectly amicable with her.

But my mom and gparents are like that... They are two-faced to everyone but me... Idk if that is good or bad. They treat me like shit directly. Always have but I thought things were better since hs. Damn near 10 years later and no.... They are just the same and it actually seems worse.
Thank you, I just don't know what to do any more.
Yeah and people outside my immediate circle don't believe me. To *some* outside people my family out there is amicable and have talked about my transition. But these are the same people who talk down about trans people to me once I came out. ""Oh, she doesn't look like a woman"", ""you'll never know what it is like to be a real man"". To me they are vile about it as well as to my friends and gf. But to people who have nothing to do with me.... People who aren't my little misfits... Nah they are amicable. So it isn't like they are denying what I am doing, no they will discuss it if it comes up but it feels more like they ""hey look I am supportive"" bs.
Yeah there was a large manilla envelope that held 3 cards. The manilla had my gf and my preferred name (even though it was spelled the common way but that is okay), Tara and ""Carson""(Carsen). Then we opened it and say three cards. A birthday card for each of us and a Xmas card for both of us. Then the bs showed itself.... All the cards said my dead name, my bday card and the xmas card. Then the xmas card regarded me as female. üò†
These people usually regard younger people as ""kiddo"", ""kid"", ""brat"", and ""trouble"". Their gender never mattered... Then, as I start transitioning it suddenly matters. Suddenly they use my dead name more, use my assigned sex more. As if I don't notice this garbage. So yeah, I know it was malicious.
Thank so much. Honestly everyone has been so nice but I really have very few people in my life. A handful of friends and then only 4 family, my mom, her parents, and a cousin who is technically no longer related. Everyone else has deserted me. Then there is the fact that they'll even send money and my mom used to come up to take us shopping for things we can't afford and need. I feel like if I cut them out totally then we will struggle more. But I also know they throw money at problems. Like, ""here shut up and be normal"" or ""look I am supportive"". I hate it. But it all helps my gf and I.
I had a similar experience with my brother.  He was accepting and supportive at first.  But then he randomly just turned.  He‚Äôs an absolute turd and told me he‚Äôs afraid of trans people around his children.  He sees me like I‚Äôm some sort of monster and it was probably the most soul crushing heart wrenching thing I‚Äôve ever had said to me.
Then they know they're wrong just like every transphobe does on some level, and only express their real feelings when they feel it's safe to do so. If it were me, I'd put it all over social media how they act.
Damn that sucks,  but yeah, to my family it is apparently okay to ignore all of my changes and still treat me by my assigned sex. It is freaking angering and I so badly want them to understand. But those Trump stans seem like they never will.
Man I am tempted... But it also feels pointless.
Not trying to tell you how to live your life, but if that's how you feel you need to consider cutting them out of your life, if you can.
Sorry for the late reply. I have considered it but I really do want family in my life. Like, just a parent or gparent would be so great. Honestly for now I just am gonna step away and wait."	rj3sgi	trans	55	0.97	2021-12-18 09:19:08
What can I do for my upset mother?	"So about 3 days ago I came out as a mtf transgender to my mother. (FYI, I already came out to my sister who was supportive, and have no plan to talk to father). Well then‚Ä¶ she got upset. 

She was, like not mad toward me, okay partially mad at me, and more like ‚Äòwhy this is happening to me‚Äô type of denial. 

Of course I anticipated this, but never thought It could be more shocker to others then myself. I don‚Äôt know, I was just ‚Äòokay, trans it is.‚Äô when I finally decided. 

Well this is going out of track. The point is, she said she can‚Äôt sleep at night, can‚Äôt eat anything, and sad all the time. and it‚Äôs quite heartbreaking for me. I‚Äôm worried about her. I‚Äôm worried about if she got some hateful information from internet. I‚Äôm so sorry about saying that fact, I‚Äôm worried about if she disappointed about this. 

Maybe should I give her some space and moments to acceptance? Or hug? I tried dry humor, some small talk, uplifting news from my work, but I‚Äôm out of idea. she‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ who just sentenced cancer which couldn‚Äôt be reversed. I really don‚Äôt depend on reddit for relationship advice, but this time I really need desperate help."	"This isn't happening to her. It sounds like she's employing passive-aggressive manipulation tactics. I say give her space all the space she needs until she accepts you for who you are.
it almost sounds like she's being manipulative
Tell her to speak to a counselor or someone who is *NOT YOU* about her feelings. Point her towards PFLAG or a local LGBTQ+ support group, or a recommended therapist, or other good resources via email. She needs some time to process her feelings and that's okay, but it's not a thing you should be subjected to until she accepts you as you are, and you should tell her that. It's not fair for her to burden you like that, and for her to say toxic damaging things as she sorts through her thoughts and feelings. Let her take as much time as she needs and accept nothing less than radical acceptance.
If she's sad you're trying to be happy, I don't know what you can do except wait and see if she comes around.
Agree with the previous posts‚Ä¶this is manipulative and/or selfish of her. She‚Äôs making it about her and it‚Äôs not. Distance yourself and let her decide what‚Äôs important. If she decides to accept it, make sure to be firm about not making passive-aggressive comments either. Get on top of it early so that you set clear boundaries would be my advice. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è
She trying to guilt trip you.
Parents are supposed to champion their children when they come out...especially in this climate of transphobia. She is supposed to ask you about you, not make it about her. Has she responded in the past to news she didn't want to hear or situations she didn't like this; becoming emotionally manipulative? If so, then she may indeed be a passive aggressive personality type. If you don't know what that means, look it up. I champion my trans kid and support him however I can because it is about him, not me. She has a choice to make: accept you as you are or step aside and get out of your way and let you live an authentic life. A mom who really loves her child for themselves, not what they want them to be, will choose acceptance. I know she's your mother and you love her but you need some allies if you don't already have a circle. Because if you don't bow to her emotional blackmail, it will just get worse. I am the mother of of trans son and a mental health professional. I know manipulation when I see it, I know what it is like for your kid to tell you he's trans. It's a cause for celebration and a doubling down on the emotional support.
My mother also made it about her.  She‚Äôs a narcissist and had to go to three therapy sessions just to understand it‚Äôs not about her.  There‚Äôs only so much you can do.  She‚Äôs going to have to look at herself and realize it‚Äôs not about her.
my mom has been doing the same thing ever since I came out as ftm. she seems to be in denial and ‚Äúblames‚Äù me for it almost like she is a victim. im currently distancing myself from my mother as much as I can without seeming rude. it really sucks that you have to go through that. i wish you luck with everything.
If you really think she's struggling because of misinformation I'd suggest you make her read the gender dysphoria bible, I'm literally planning on translating it to spanish, printing it, handing it out to my family and giving them 5 days to read it without any permission for questions until the finish line at which point I'll talk to them and come out (yes I'm kind of a control freak but I really don't wanna come out and receive ignorant responses about it). I'd also, and I think most on this comment section agree, would advice you to consider the possibility of your mother trying to manipulate you by playing the victim here, maybe even being a narcissist. Remember this is about you and she should be the one wondering what to do to support you, not you supporting her because she's the mother of a trans person as if that was a burden.
Everyone is right. If your mother is anything less than happy for you then she's the problem, not you.
Just give it time.
Well she just realised she lost a son and now has a daughter. Give her some time.
I've learned that parents could take a while to accept you, eventually they're going to realize you're just being happy the way you are. Idk how to personally help your mom, cause when me and my mom are having issues, usually small talk makes everything better. I would say maybe some sort of therapy, but idk. I wish I could help better I'm so sorry üò¢ I just hope everything turns out to be great!üíñ
she can get the fuck over it.

it sounds like you care about her. it sounds like you're a good kid. but she's being actively and purposefully transphobic. she's trying to guilt you into not being yourself. she's worried about how SHE feels and what SHE wants, and neither of those things matter here.

so she can get over it. that is the only right thing to do. 

you, however, are fine, and don't need to do anything to help her.
It‚Äôs unreasonable for her to make what you are experiencing all about her like that. She‚Äôs your mom, it‚Äôs her job to support you. Your just doing your best to be yourself.
Two of my three children are struggling to find their identities. They've both come out as bisexual and the older one recently came out to us as trans. We've always told them that only they know who they are inside and no one else has the right to try and tell them who they are, us included.

The only negative feelings I had about Any of it was just my knowledge of how much harder the rest of the world might make their lives. As I write this more US states are trying to push anti-gay anti-trans legislation, pride events are being crashed by hateful bigots, and prejudice abounds. I worry they will be hurt for being who they are, but I could never be ashamed of them or 'mourn' for the future I had planned because they want to live their lives honestly as themselves.

I would try talking it out. Ask her what specifically about it all is causing her so much grief. If that doesn't go well, involve a counselor.

Spend more time with your sister and surround yourself with all those who are genuinely supportive. And please, OP, know that this isn't something you've 'done to her.' You have the right to live your life however makes you happy and healthy in your own skin. Good luck‚ô•Ô∏è
She's treating you coming out as if you died, that's not good for you to be around. Intentionally or not, she's manipulating you and emotionally abusing you. You need to establish boundaries that she shouldn't vent to you about these things and that she has to start seeing a therapist about these thoughts. Just know that if you feel at any point that she will harm herself or she threatens you that she will harm herself, you can call the emergency number to come do a psych eval on her. They'll make sure that if she's in danger of harming herself she gets help via momentary forced hospitalization.
although you may feel bad for your mother this sounds like manipulation, it isn't about her it's about you and your feelings and what you wanna do. not her.
but if you leave the situation it might get worse and result in her being ignorant or getting hateful. You could try a therapist, usually for some when you come out a therapist can help make sure it's the right decision for you and help your family if their struggling to accept it.
Go back to being her son and not kill your self in a year
This. PFLAG is very helpful and supportive. Parents often grieve the life they imagined for their child and it takes time to accept/appreciate their child will now lead a happy successful life and above all LIVE! My mom did (and sometimes still does even after I tansitioned over 40 years ago), because she thinks SHE did something wrong (it's about her?), or that I did something TO her... Both means she is thinking of herself and not you. It takes time and there may always be a slight sense of loss for them if and UNTIL, they realize all they really ever wanted was for their child to be safe, happy and ALIVE!

IM NOT STRAIGHT!!!	"Okay I‚Äôm not as mad as the title suggests but this is just a quick little rant. 

So I‚Äôm trans (M2F pre-procedure not on hormones) and I have expressed many many times that I‚Äôm only into women and have never ever expressed being into men, but once I come out to someone they always say something like ‚Äúso you‚Äôre into men now?‚Äù Am I wrong to be mad about this? I just think it‚Äôs dumb that when I say I‚Äôm a woman to some people my whole sexual preference changes. I understand it‚Äôs not the biggest thing in the world, and usually when I correct them they understand and the convo ends there, but Idk to me it‚Äôs like assuming everybody is straight and gay people don‚Äôt exist. 
I‚Äôm willing to admit that I just might be looking too much into this but does any other trans person experience this cuz I have experienced this on many occasions"	"I'm FTM and everyone just assumed I was only into women now and I am also infuriated by it, I don't suddenly become straight when I transition. It is definitely a weird aspect that i think some people believe that we transition because we don't want to be gay or that gender=sexuality when it doesn't. You definitely aren't alone
Also annoying: trying to explain to someone that I'm a lesbian, and they're like ""If you're into women, wouldn't that make you straight?"" And I just want to scream ""NO, IT FUCKING DOESN'T, WOMEN WHO LIKE WOMEN ARE NOT CALLED 'STRAIGHT', IT'S SO FUCKING CLEAR THAT YOU DON'T SEE ME FOR THE WOMAN I TRULY AM!!!!""

Sorry for the caps, it's just something that always really bothers me, and I was trying to convey the infuriating feeling and the desire to scream
I‚Äôm a baby mtf who is only attracted to women. My sexuality is shopper. I‚Äôm gonna shop til I drop into a chair at a nail salon. That is my sexuality.
For a lot of people, especially cis het people who just default to whatever they‚Äôre told to do in their life, the only context they can readily think about gender in is a sexual one. And since they don‚Äôt think about anything except heterosexual sex, they just assume that‚Äôs how everyone is. It‚Äôs sad and pathetic and very frustrating. Be mad. My general response to this type of assumption when I was first coming out was, ‚ÄúWe have never discussed my sexuality before and we aren‚Äôt starting right now.‚Äù or ‚ÄúNothing about me other than my name and presentation has changed.‚Äù Usually in an obviously irritated tone of voice. If I really liked the person I would explain that gender =/= sexuality but there wasn‚Äôt enough time in the day to try to explain it to most.
Similarly- IM A GAY MAN. IM NOT A LESBIAN. (the pre-T struggle of a gay trans man)
I don‚Äôt even know anymore‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm landing somewhere around ‚Äúmostly gay but a little bi(?)‚Äù
Personally I have always been into women  and having to transition due to some trauma and injuries/malpractice has made me lean more towards being into men, it has been a very odd experience actually; I would be lying if i said it had nothing to do with genitals but that plays a large part. As a child of about 5 years old I had decided i wanted to be a woman because i prefer the form and overall it seemed like more fun - and to me having lived my life with every experience as a man i can honestly say it is definately more fun to be female even when comparing the very real inequalities experienced by both genders out there; I should maybe mention that I am intersex and this may play a role in my decision making process when deciding to transition aswell because I have a certain unavoidable degree of .. how should i say ""feminine experience"" and i am not comfortable living as a man with what i mentioned plus having to wear panty liners every day even as a pre op M2F, it's scary, uncomfortable and frankly no other men i have encountered have these same scents as me that developed pre hrt.

for me changing my sexual preference is more of a carnal and almost evolutionary requirement and i also consider that living my life as a women will definitely make it easier to encounter someone with the genitals i feel will allow me to experience myself completely as i am somewhat forced to due to the physical and mental health reasons i mentioned earlier.

I am sorry you have had this stress from others making assumptions but it's easy to understand why people have this misconception when we consider the intrinsic nature and somewhat backward and completely outdated although very common understanding of what a woman looks like and have for body parts compared to what  a man has.

does this mean i would not be ok with dating a trans man? of course not, but for my preference and desires that i cannot avoid i would have to be honest with myself and say that I would feel as though i am missing out on some experience of a sexual nature and nothing else - if i had it my way I would keep my penis  and continue transitioning fully into the woman i am and will be but that would mean leaving myself open to an increased risk of cancer (peyronies disease) and obviously what i percieve as a typical female experience being that of a natal penis owned by my partner- however wrong i may be.."	tf8rqo	trans	50	0.96	2022-03-16 03:59:55
My parents and my relationship has lost all integrity. CW transphobia	"My mom is awful and I just can't even with her sometimes. I came out to her, and she simplifies it all to wanting to cross dress. She has misinformation informing her transphobia, saying that somehow I'd loose the ability to be sexually pleased, which I don't know why that matters to her! I'm her daughter! 

But anyways the most annoying things are that when I first came out she would deadname me, insisting that my name isn't my name, and misgender me. It took a big shouting match to get her to show any sort of change. The fight was because I didn't want to talk to my parents at all anymore. I wonder how it got here. 

After the shouting match I only heard her say you to refer to me for weeks. Recently, she's been using they to refer to me. As though that isn't a work around from referring to me. Still she avoids my name. Does she think it's okay to ignore my pronouns if she doesn't use gendered pronouns? It's still blatantly disrespectful, which is the thing that my parents were mad at me in the first place. 

My dad is a lot better, but it is still frustrating because whenever I'm not in the room they deadname me and misgender me. They seem upset when I get upset at them misgendering me because ""We're trying so hard"" but if they just always used my name and pronouns they'd basically never make a mistake. It's been 5 months since I came out. 

Worst is they don't understand how talking to a therapist could be more valuable to talking to them. I want to tell them I hate them both, but I know that'd just make it harder until I escape soon."	"""We're trying so hard"" uhuh. We can tell when someone is actually trying, don't lie to yourself.

Anyway babe, I'm so, so sorry. I hope things can end up better :/ it hasn't been long since you came out, who knows if after a year is different. I'm going through something really similar so I know how it feels. Awful. Send you looots of hugs üíå
I hope you can leave soon, your dummy parents don't realize they have the coolest daughter and they sound really annoying to be around.
Defining transgender individuals as transvestites (cross dressers) is an outdated view over a 100 years old. üôÑ
My god, I‚Äôm going through a situation where my mom is really accepting, so I came out to her, but I refuse to tell anyone else because I just don‚Äôt have any trust towards people like my stepfather. He‚Äôs very stuck in his ways, and he‚Äôs not nice about anything. :(, I really wish you the best of luck, and do recommend trying a therapist if things either get worse, or it‚Äôs all the same, either way, good luck, all of us are here for you, and a lot of us feel your pain, so we understand :) (also, what pronouns do you use? I don‚Äôt want to misgender you :))
""If you were trying you would have gotten it by now. I used that name for myself just as long as you used it for me before I came out and I haven't ever gotten it wrong.""
Thanks. It's been hard, but I'm going to be able to leave pretty soon. It helps to hear you sympathize. Hug.
Yeah, thanks. I have plans to move out and live with some friends this summer.
*I* am aware of that, but my parents (especially my mom) seem to have no understanding of transgenderism. When I asked her if she thought it was a mental illness (like my brother has told me) she said, ""I don't know, you don't talk about it much"" as if I am the arbiter on whether or not it is. Then when I called her out for thinking it is a mental illness, because only the people who think it's a mental illness would avoid giving an assertive no, she gaslighted me because ""I didn't say that"".
Thanks. I'm glad you can trust your mom. I do how to get a therapist if I have the money when I move out.
good luck on that! anyhow im sure everything will be fine
Is educating her is possible?  She‚Äôs obviously not doing herself.
That‚Äôs good :)
She's an anti vaxer who doesn't trust doctors or understand why a therapist might help more than talking to the family. Maybe I could try, but I don't love her and it'd take a really solid argument. Maybe it'd take more than that.
Thinking about it a little more, no. You could make an argument so good that a lawyer would cry and she wouldn't be convinced."	stx703	trans	52	0.9	2022-02-16 14:27:23
(TW: RANT) r/teenagers is incredibly transphobic	I've recently seen so many transphobic posts there, and they all have a lot of upvotes. And the transphobic comments are never, like,  - something upvotes. Idk, it just makes me really mad. Sorry for ranting a bit.	"Agreed. I stopped interacting with that subreddit because I got tired of the rampant transphobia on pretty much any post about trans people.
A lot of popular subreddit are transophobic in my opinion

They probably think they are seem as ""cool"" to denigrating the minority

That's the same thing in real life ...

It's like school when you tell you're from a minority to someone alone they don't care
But when you tell you're from a minority in the middle of a lot of students they are always one person who come from nowhere to denigrate you because they feel confident in their stupidity when they are in a large group
i tried to argue in Lia Thomas case and was downvoted XD. i expected it but definitely a transphobic sub.
I strongly agree, And someone got a shit tone of upvotes for some transphobic post
Can I troll the transphobia? I‚Äôm bored and wanna laugh at some stupidity. I won‚Äôt be too toxic I‚Äôll try troll without being mean to any specific person
Yup! I just left because I don't really check it that often, but it's crazy how transphobic it is on there.
The only thing you get is a bunch of downvotes, but I guess if you want to, go ahead! Just remember, don't be rude. Have fun!! :)
It's so disheartening when the transphobic comments are so popular and the people calling the transphobes out are downvoted half to death. I got so frustrated until I decided it just isn't worth hanging around.
I try not be rude but I just wanna counter stupidity in a non toxic way that is still funny.
Then yeah go ahead! I hope you have fun lol
Thx^^

hello, I need to light this post up	"Hi.
I am a trans male myself, but that is not the important thing now. I knew one girl, trans woman. Her name was Erin. She is the nicest, greatest and most amazing woman I have ever met in my life. We dated for some time, unfortunately only long distance. We had amazing plans and dreams. 
The thing is that I am an idiot. I am sick and I know it but I made steps to be better. I know she uses Reddit. And I hope she follows this tag. I would be grateful if she were able to read this message because I have no other ways to let her know.

I know she won't talk to me again, I don't even use the app we used to talk at anymore. I just want to let her know I love her. I always did and I always will. I'll never have the same connection with anyone else and I'll definitely never forget her. She helped me at my darkest times and never got mad at me for being a weirdo or paranoid or whatever.

I think I am transphobic	"If I posted this in the wrong place, tell me. If I made anyone uncomfortable and they want me to remove this I will. Trigger warning for transphobic feelings.

Hey....So I have been thinking about this ever since I lost a friend. I think I may be transphobic. I have tried to inform myself ever since I learned about LGBTQ+. I think people should live as how they feel proper and trans people are valid. However, whenever I learn someone transitioned, I feel immediate dislike and disgust. I feel super ashamed afterword, but still I feel these feelings. I even subconsciously avoid people that I learned had transitioned. I always reason with myself and get over my disgust, but those initial moments... how do I stop being transphobic? All of my friends are part of the LGBTQ and I love my friends. I don't want me and my reactions to ruin any more of the relationships I treasure.

This issue has me torn. The way I think and the way I feel is so completely different. This has been a major source of self disgust and every time I google things about this, I just find people saying ""research more"" and I don't know if that will fix this. I have researched for years (about 6 years) and I still feel these feelings. I had even thought myself to posibly be lgbtq and felt these same feeling to myself. I decided I am cis and straight.

&#x200B;

tldr: I have feelings of disgust every time I learn someone transitioned. I don't like this. What to do?

Edit:(This turns into an angry ramble. You have been forewarned) 

it has been about a week now, and I would like to say thank you to everyone who posted. I read all the replies. I have some wonderful sources now. I would also like to say that I am a female. I understand most people thinking I may be male due to the bearded man pfp. I just hit the randomize button and thought he looked cozy. A lot of people have asked me what my fear may be. My fear is that I may be trans. I alluded to it vaguely in my last sentence, I just wasn't comfortable sharing it at that time. I now realize that has caused misunderstandings, and I take full responsibility. I have some dysphoria when it comes to my breasts. I have always despised them and refuse to look in mirrors when there is a chance I could see them. This among other things has caused me to wonder if I was trans. I refuse to entertain this thought however as I know my family would no longer like me. My dad voted for former president Donald Trump, my mom thinks all trans people are scary things and enbys don't exist/are mentally unwell (despite her saying that she isn't phobic). My mom holds my bank account and my dad owns my car. My aunt transitioned and my all of family really dislikes her. I was told to never speak of her or else others would think I was trans. Trans has always been a sort of unspoken evil in my family. I love my cousins and mother too much to attempt to ever do something gender nonconforming around them. I am 19 and have been an adult for 2 years and still live with my family. I learned the term ""trans"" when I was about 13 and ever since then I have been researching it quite a bit. My greatest desire for when I move out is to cut off all of my hair and get a buzz cut. And never wear a dress again. I posted this now because I didn't really want this to see the light of day but I am mad and needed to vent. 

My aunt is actually not the greatest person, but relations got worse when she transitioned. She is M2F. She has backstabbed all of my family members in some way or another for financial gain, she got my dad drunk and had him sign a contract that negatively effected him. That is only one example. My aunt has been the shining example of a real life trans person for the majority of my family, only reinforcing beliefs that trans is bad. My family kind of taught me this with her as an example. They would dead name her as ""petty revenge"". At the time I thought dead naming was ok as a result, until I looked into it further. 

I guess the point of this edit is to say that I am far to scared of the consequences that could arise if I were to explore my sexuality and gender properly and that reading all of the peoples answers has made me ashamed of my fear of that exploration. I had originally made this post thinking that these 2 feelings were separate but now I realize them to be connected. My fear of the possibility of being trans seeping out and affecting others around me. Thank you Reddit."	"The first thought is your parents/teachers thoughts, the second is your own.   


As long as you keep those second thoughts to be good, you will eventually find them to become your first thoughts.   
Fuck i still need to remind myself of this. When i play games and someones being annoying, my first thought is 'wow they are a \[r-slur\]' and i have to mentally step back and correct myself 'wow they are ANNOYING, nothing else'   
Or if i hear someone with a stereotypical gay voice, despite being gay myself, my first thought is 'wow, \[f-slur\]' and i have to correct myself. Why?  
*Because the first thought is whats been drilled into me. Its my fathers thoughts. Not my own.*  
Once you realize that you can better yourself, you are already doing better than those first thoughts.  


Sorry for my ramble, but ive experienced this too, and nobody talks about it. The fact is, its the life of alot of people who were raised with those thoughts ingrained in them. But as long as you try to do better, you can do better.
Wow that's very honest of you.
I think, therefore I am. You are curing yourself subconsciously by coming here. Exposure therapy to treat transphobia.
Well everyone is innately biased because our ancestors based on our fear of foreign groups for survival sake. However that instinctual prejudices become annoying in modern day. So don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself for thinking this way. Actually it is already great you immerse yourself with lgbtq despite these feelings. I am impressed by your honesty and willingness to associate with the uncomfortable. I myself was transphobic before realizing I was trans. I guess it was because I was not yet exposed enough. I am curious, after 6 years of exposure, you must have an idea of what exactly bothers you about trans people. What would that be exactly? Why is it that transitioning is disgusting?
If you genuinely want to change the way you think and feel about something, the way to do it is therapy.
How you deal with this is unique to you, but have you spent time considering what life is for us trans and enby people? Im not talking intellectually, im talking about putting yourself in our shoes?

Consider that for many of us, generally speaking, not transitioning is one of only 2 options and the one of those is the last option ever. 

Spend time thinking about what you would do in that situation. No one can grow for you. You cant become ok with trans people by only knowing the intellectual parts of the equation, you need to understand the emotional side of it.
It's good that you're working on self growth.  

I think the biggest thing to learn is that most cis people do inately fear themselves being the opposite sex. And that fear sometimes comes off as fear of trans people because our presence makes you think about something that as applied to you would make you uncomfortable.

The lesson here is, ùòµùò©ùò¢ùòµ'ùò¥ ùò®ùò¶ùòØùò•ùò¶ùò≥ ùò•ùò∫ùò¥ùò±ùò©ùò∞ùò≥ùò™ùò¢.  You imagine yourself in a body that doesn't reflect your identity for a second and it feels wrong.  That's how we feel pre transition every moment of every day, until we transition and start to feel right.

The more you allow yourself to be around trans folks, you'll learn to separate us from your own dysphoria about imagining yourself as the opposite sex, and realize, yeah you can even relate to how important it is for us to transition.
Maybe you're confusing intrusive thoughts with your actual thoughts? One thing I'd recommend is start consuming queer content, like tv shows, like Pose, Heartstopper, Sandman, Young Royals, Shameless (on HBO, but the other ones you can watch on Netflix). Or watching trans youtubers, like Noah Fince, Imo Blair White is not a very good trans rep, but she does some good takes *sometimes*, or a tik toker called Dylan (she's an awesome person btw)
Your initial thought is never your own. It's the one you've been taught is correct
if someone says they‚Äôre trans,
forget it.
completely ignore the fact they‚Äôre trans. Just act like nothing changed, because in reality, nothing changed.
they‚Äôre still the Man/Woman/Person that you know.
I was going to talk about the first thought/second thought idea but WoodyBaka beat me to it. We all have these ‚Äúfirst though‚Äù biases ingrained in us whether we realize it or not. Prejudice instilled early in childhood is difficult to shake. I would say the fact that you are repulsed by your bias is a sign that you don‚Äôt really believe in it. If you were ‚Äútruly‚Äù transphobic on a deep level you wouldn‚Äôt care. If you keep working at it I believe that your second thoughts will eventually become your first thoughts. I also think it‚Äôs valuable to explore what the root of your repulsion is, as that will affect how well you are able to recover. For my part, I had a lot of internalized transphobia growing up largely because I knew instinctively on some level that I was trans, and that everyone around me HATED trans people with a burning passion. Burying my identity and shying away from anything remotely trans-related was a way of protecting myself from abuse. I didn‚Äôt realize I was trans until I started trying to push back on the bias I was raised with. Not saying you‚Äôre trans, but if you were, this would affect how you address transphobia differently than if you‚Äôre bothered by a subversion of gender roles, or if you had the idea that ‚Äúgender/sex is eternal and immutable‚Äù hammered into you as a child. Knowledge is power, and I‚Äôve seldom started improving before I knew what was wrong in the first place. I want to commend you for being honest about having a problem, takes a lot of courage and shows a lot of character.
I, myself, am told by my wife, sometimes I am somewhat transphobic. I don‚Äôt agree, but I can‚Äôt fully deny it either. So, don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. You‚Äôre on the right path. However, stop punishing yourself for it. The more you fight it, more it‚Äôll become an issue. Just keep appreciating the people in your life and the lines will start becoming blurry‚Ä¶
You‚Äôre trying your best and that‚Äôs what matters, plus you‚Äôre supportive.
Thank you so much for that!
You're already on the right track to deconstructing the transphobic rhetoric that's been drilled into your head. I'd say maybe go on TikTok or YouTube and watch some trans creators let yourself get past that initial corrupted thought so you can start seeing them for the people they really are. Honestly when I first started seeing trans content creators on TikTok I still had some internalized transphobia and just watching trans content helped me finish deconstructing... It also helped me come to terms with my own identity. But that's another story for another day. But yeah do that. Maybe start interacting with the trans people you've been avoiding (you can let them know you're trying to get past the negative feelings that you've been having like it may hurt them knowing that you've felt the way you have but the fact that you're putting in an effort to be better might help the situation)
This may be the first time phobia is used correctly on Reddit. There actually seems to be an irrational fear here. As your original post doesn‚Äôt mention parents a lot of people may be jumping to the conclusion of conditioning during childhood. Myself as a child of the 80‚Äôs am disgusted by the content of entertainment from that generation. But that really changed as we went into the 90‚Äôs and then had a major change entering the new millennium. Society does have an influence especially considered what was/is considered societal norms. It absolutely appears that you recognize these personal feelings as wrong and that‚Äôs a first step. Therapy is the best route when it comes to phobias. I read that you don‚Äôt have money but insurance does cover therapy even the ACA.
Wtf
So, I have a *slightly* similar issue, but it's more like I'm ashamed of myself not being able to transition, and thus I cannot partake in most things with other trans or enby people that involve transitioning or celebrating it. It's like self-hatred and inward disgust for me.

Basically I'm transphobic only to myself.
Whenever you feel like this, remember how many trans folks in here took time to read and even talk to you and try to help you when you just admitted they disgust you. Though I‚Äôm  not that kind of trans person and reading this just made me want to slap you in the face. Your brain, your own education, your choices, not our problem
So you created a brand new account just to come tell us, ""No offense, but the very thought of you makes me sick.""

What did you expect us to do for you?
Tbh, I got super uncomfortable around trans people growing up‚Ä¶until I figured out I‚Äôm trans too and then it mostly went away. Still had stuff to work on but it got better. Glad you want to get better.
I don't want to hear about how much I disgust you
as someone who was raised in a conservative home, i know how what you hear can make you feel a certain way. but when i went into middleschool, i learned to care for people. because we‚Äôre all people. we aren‚Äôt better or worse for being straight, gay, cis, or trans. i was able to change my views real fast by simply realizing they‚Äôre innocent people just like the rest of us. it‚Äôs one thing not to date trans people because of genital preferences, and that‚Äôs fine. but to be blatantly hating and rude to trans people isn‚Äôt okay. all i can advise is try your best to view them as people like you. what if you were in their situation, you know?? meeting a trans person may also help. i thought lgbt was wrong but 1) i developed my own personal thoughts and realized what others were shaming them for wasn‚Äôt right, and that they‚Äôre people like the rest of us, and 2) having a queer friend helps you build a relationship with queer people, and helps you care for and love them more. the fact you want to change is already great. but it‚Äôll be some work. don‚Äôt let others think for you. trans people are human and deserve rights like we do, it should be pretty easy to accept soon
I think you're doing pretty good. The transphobia you were raised with takes time to undo, so the longer you deal with it, the easier it becomes. It takes us some time to let go of the transphobia, too. Maybe talk to a therapist about it, as this seems to really be affecting you.
I think the fact that you are able to admit this bias and are seeking help to eliminate it is rare and huge! shows that you are already worlds ahead of most people who are truly transphobic. to me it sounds like you ultimately do accept trans people, but have been societally conditioned to find transition unacceptable. it might be helpful to read some trans literature to hear a trans person‚Äôs own perspective on their transition to have a more encompassing understanding of it. i read janet mock‚Äôs ‚Äúredefining realness‚Äù and it‚Äôs a beautiful book that I think is great insight for those who want to be supportive but are fighting that taught bias.
*headpats*
Props to OP for honesty and desire to grow past this
I think you might be disgusted because you‚Äôre not used to it, and it frightens you. You should try to make yourself used to the presence of trans people. First you should try and browse some content made by trans creators (on youtube my favourites are abigail thorn, contrapoints, sam collins, noah finnce, jamie dodger)
And eventually talk to your trans acquaintance more, and try to reflect on why such emotions come up. 
When you say you ""decided"" you were cis and straight, what do you mean? Have you ever had some conflicted thoughts about your identity?
You are doing the right thing right now: say it. 

Call yourself out. When you think those things, tell yourself ‚Äúok that was transphobic‚Äù and even say it aloud. You can‚Äôt fix what you deny is broken by saying ‚ÄúI might be transphobic‚Äù you have to instead tell yourself ‚ÄúI am transphobic‚Äù

Most straight cis people think transitioning is sexually motivated. Is that why you‚Äôre disgusted? I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre male? Women are less transphobic than men because 80% of their reasons for hating us are sexual in nature. Truly ask yourself why you are disgusted, and let it the fuck go.
Your error is in persisting in the belief that your transphobia is in any way ""natural.""

That you can't help the way you feel. You have ""friends"" (don't you f!!ckers always ""have queer friends,"" too?)in the LGBTQIA+ community, but even so ... your natural revulsion just doesn't clear you to land on this field.

That about it?

Piss off.
I'm not even gonna lie, as soon as I read the title I laughed. at least you're being honest with yourself ig üò≠ every transphobic person ik always try to argue with me about it and say ""they aren't transphobic it's just wrong"" like bitch what? üíÄ anyway if you really care about this and don't want to feel this way I'd suggest maybe going to therapy, or if you can sit in on lgbtq clubs, who knows maybe if you just make yourself hang out with trans people you'll start to see they're still just people and they aren't disgusting or bad. idrk how to help, I've never met a transphobe who felt bad about it üò≠ but I definitely do suggest therapy, it could be helpful.

I rlly do think exposure could help, maybe force yourself to stop avoiding trans people. my grandma was hellaa transphobic and said It was disgusting and wrong and a sin, but we've actually gotten very close over the past 10+ months and she doesn't say things like that to me anymore, she uses my preferred name and sorta tries with my pronouns, she tells doctors and teachers my preferred name and pronouns so I don't get misgendered at school or doctor's offices. she also used to be super homophobic and get upset over gay characters/couples on tv but now she only gets upset bc she doesn't like pda in general, she doesn't wanna watch people make out on tv lmao so it's not bc they're gay anymore it's only when they start making out or smth and she's the same with the straight couples. so it's definitely possible to change, I never thought she would but here we are!
Maybe it's not disgust but jealousy?
you said that you are ashamed for feeling that way-that tells me you don't mean the initial reaction. like other commenters, I feel like this reaction might have been the words of others, and subconsiously teaching you hatred. I think you should try not to avoid trans people as much, and mayb you'll get usd to us :D
I'm a trans woman and I've had to deal with exactly this. It's a big part of why I was closeted for so long, and I still don't think I'm fully over it. My advice would be to try desensitisation, where once you subconsciously start to accept something as normal the initial reaction you would usually have starts to fade.

Make a conscious effort not to avoid trans people. Try to spend more time with trans people, without making it weird. Look at images of trans people (not porn btw, trans people in everyday life. Porn might help, but could condition you to see trans people as sexual). Eventually you will subconsciously start to accept transness as normal, and that initial disgust will fade.
There‚Äôs internalized transphobia and overt transphobia. 

Overt transphobia is active. It‚Äôs people engaging in hateful rhetoric. It‚Äôs people only listening to other transphobic people and feeding hate through fear in people who are ignorant or on the fence. It‚Äôs those weaponizing our existence to gain power. 

Internalized transphobia is there because it‚Äôs how you learned to navigate the world. Society taught it. Maybe your parents taught it. It‚Äôs normalized. It‚Äôs what the overtly transphobic try to pull at in you. Many trans people have it ourselves. 

It‚Äôs the thing that had me‚Äî an enby that uses they/them‚Äî being like ‚Äúbut people with neopronouns are just being extra‚Äù before I really sat and picked it apart. 

It‚Äôs the thing that has some binary trans people saying that I just need to figure out that I‚Äôm a man already. It‚Äôs the thing that leads much of the trans community to judge ourselves or other trans people as ‚Äúnot trans enough‚Äù. 

Everyone has internalized biases. It‚Äôs what you do with them that matters. 

Are you doing any active work with the thoughts or feelings? Or are you just waiting til they go away?  If you‚Äôre able to, finding a therapist that does CBT might be helpful. 

What I‚Äôm going to offer here is not therapy advice or even recommendations‚Ä¶ but things you might consider‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre things I‚Äôve found helpful with my own biases.

I approach the thoughts and feelings with curiosity. I have found that the more I try to force myself to believe something I don‚Äôt believe‚Äî even if it‚Äôs something I really want to believe‚Äî the more my brain comes up with reasons for what I actually believe, and that just reinforces the problem

‚Ä¢what is it I really believe here?
  (be honest. If the answer is ‚ÄòI want to believe trans people are valid but I don‚Äôt quite think they‚Äôre the same as cis people‚Äô okay. If the answer is ‚ÄòI‚Äôm pretty disgusted by trans people‚Äô okay‚Ä¶ you have to meet yourself where you‚Äôre at).

‚Ä¢ how much do I believe it? (Scale of 0-10 or 100%‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt really matter)

‚Ä¢what evidence do I think I have for my belief? (i.e. *why* do I think I believe this?)

‚Ä¢for each piece of evidence‚Ä¶ what are the other possible explanations?
 (e.g. if the belief is ‚ÄúI think trans people are creepy‚Äù and one of the whys is ‚Äúevery time I see a trans person they‚Äôre acting suspicious‚Äù 
other possible explanations might be 

-that the person is uncomfortable in the setting that they‚Äôre in

-maybe they‚Äôre worried about hateful things being said

-maybe they‚Äôre anxious about something entirely unrelated to their identity

-maybe they‚Äôre stressed because they‚Äôve got a lot going on at work. 

-I would also include that maybe I see a lot more trans people than I think I do I‚Äôm just unaware that they‚Äôre trans

‚Ä¶.when I‚Äôm doing this exercise for my own faulty beliefs I find every possible explanation I can think of for every piece of ‚Äòevidence‚Äô and write it down in ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù form‚Ä¶ it takes a long time but it‚Äôs training the brain to consider alternatives)

‚Ä¢then I start using bridging statements (sometimes these get called if-formations‚Ä¶ though that‚Äôs usually for self beliefs) to help myself start building the bridge between what I currently believe and what I want to believe. 

Bridging statements live in the possibility, the what if, the maybe. They open the door to a different belief without forcing it and allow the brain to look for evidence instead of doubling down on the current belief.

So if I figured out my belief currently was ‚Äútrans people are creepy‚Äù
my first bridging statement might be: ‚Äúwhat if it‚Äôs possible trans people aren‚Äôt quite as creepy as I perceive them to be?‚Äù

and I would just sit with that. Hang out with it for a while. Remind myself of it regularly (for me that‚Äôs often setting it as the background on my phone or setting a reminder with whatever that may be) make sure to pose it any time that original thought comes up naturally. 

Eventually I find enough evidence that I can sit with the next statement‚Ä¶ which is usually turning the first statement into something more firm. So in this example something like ‚ÄúTrans people aren‚Äôt quite as creepy as I used to think they were‚Äù and I repeat the process of reminding myself that regularly. 

Then once I get that down really well, I go back to the possibility realm. In this example. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs possible some trans people are even pretty chill.‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

and I would just keep repeating that process until I got to ‚Äútrans people are normal and just as valid as any other human‚Äù‚Ä¶ or whatever I wanted the positive belief to be. 

The key, I‚Äôve found, is not moving on from any of the maybes or the more firm statements until I really feel like it‚Äôs my core belief now. Until it‚Äôs AT LEAST at the same ranking or more on ‚Äúhow much do I believe it‚Äù than the initial belief.
Yeah, my parents always said the fa word so it's been drilled into me since like 8, I don't mean it though- nd alwshame myself for it
Yup, this.
This is good advice  üëè üëèüëè
i mean, at least they‚Äôre TRYING to get better. it‚Äôs better to admit you‚Äôre wrong and get help than to stay an asshole. i really hope they can get where they need to be. the fact they show interest in changing gives me hope.
The thing is I am really bad at knowing and realizing myself, my thoughts, and who I am. I am unsure of what it is that I dislike as there is nothing to dislike. I have tried to figure it out and cannot. My family is definitely anti LGBTQ and I think there may be some childhood dislike lingering, but I am not sure. You would think that wouldn't be affecting me as an adult.
If I had that kind of money I would. I did do some therapy for a bit but the therapy wasn't going the way I wanted/felt I needed. I quit and don't have the money to go therapist shopping.
this. it seems like (and please correct me if im wrong) once you learn someone is trans, you put their transness before the fact that theyre a person. a regular person, just like you. in lots of situations our transness is a vital part of our lives. its our lived experiences, our perspectives, it shapes us to our core, but we are still human and deserving of love and empathy. it seems like you know this, OP, you just struggle with applying it. honestly, its going to take a lot of work to undo that bias, but it seems like youre willing to put in the work. what youre doing by being in the trans reddit is good, read as much about our lives as you can until this is normal to you. read into psychology, specifically about unlearning biases. i would also recommend finding fiction books by trans authors about our experiences, especially if they belong to a community you belong to so you can find a way to relate to the characters. off the top of my head id recommend looking into cemetery boys by aiden thomas. studies have shown that fiction books do affect the way we think, so finding books and media where being trans is normal and you see what life is actually like for us, the joy we experience, our ups and downs, our euphoria will likely help. try to look for happier books to reinforce the idea that being trans isnt something to be disgusted of

summary: find ways to learn to see the human in us so you can embrace the trans in us. read books by us, for us. listen to our stories and find what you can relate to. have patience with yourself, but dont expect all trans people to welcome you with open arms into our community with your current outlook on us, some of us have just had it really rough and would prefer our safe spaces to stay that way
Cis Men often say if they could be a woman, 99% of their answers are sexual in nature. Asking a cishet man to imagine being trans is exactly how they start believing we are monsters. They believe if they were in womenswear, they would be aroused, so all trans women must feel the same way.
Yeah, I would say the same. Like how would you feel if you lived in a wrong body and had to present as such and constantly bc of that got missgendered. Propably quite bad.

I atleast did and still do when it happens like half the time. And having issues with gender assesment clinic denying assesmwnt literally felt like nearing the final option until I found a semi diy way to go through transition.
really interesting way to put it, hadn‚Äôt thought of it this way before
Our flag means death is an excellent queer show, and One Topic At A Time makes really wholesome lgbtq+ on YouTube.
Ps. I‚Äôm a TransWoman. And what triggers me is my own ‚Äúnot passing‚Äù features. It‚Äôs only ever triggered by my own image and never by someone else‚Äôs
I did, and I apologies. I had hoped for someone to help point me in the right direction of research. A YouTube channel, a research paper, something I hadn't thought of as I have tried and failed for years. I do not wish to dislike trans people and most of the time I don't, but sometimes, my gut reaction goes against reason.
Not at all. You don't immediately become removed from the biases you witnessed growing up bc you are now an adult. Like everything, it takes time and effort to change your thinking. I think you are very brave and self aware to make the effort, and I wish more people were like that.
I'll also recommend a book called Gender Euphoria. It's a quite good book that shows the positives trans ppl experience transitioning and also does not sexualise transness.
I always think it‚Äôs better to put it in perspective the opposite way; if talking to a cis man ask them to imagine that they feel/ identify exactly as they really do but were assigned female at birth. i find this is easier for people to reach compassion because they‚Äôre not trying to imagine feeling like a gender they‚Äôre not, they‚Äôre trying to imagine being perceived as something they‚Äôre not.
I'll check those out, I love hearing about new queer shows! Where do you watch the first one?
If your desires are genuine, then I appreciate that. I don't know what we could show you after six years, though. And I will be honest: It's not our responsibility to ease your soul when you come with this message, any more than it would be the responsibility of a group of African-American folks if you went on one of their subs and told them they made you sick. At best, they would show you the door. 

Here it is, as I see it, knowing I don't speak for the whole community: We're just people, humans who want to live the best lives we can as our truest selves. Make some friends. Hopefully find love. Same as anyone else. 

Many of us have suffered greatly all our lives before coming to this point, and we know that a lot of the world hates and fears us. We don't want to hurt anyone -- or even *bother* anyone if we can help it. We just want to be treated as people. 

If you can start by working through that concept, you might make some progress.
watch the contrapoints video ‚Äòare traps gay‚Äô
Yes I agree. This post is evident enough that you carry self awareness. You actually listen to us. You attempt in understanding us. All there is left is collecting your thoughts/feelings. What really helped me not be transphobic was when I realized that I see for example a trans man a man trapped in a female vessel. Who grew up being forced to play as a female in our world of a stage. And then I sympathize with him. I later realized I empathized because I heavily related. It may be the empathy that is missing. Empathy doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me. I can see how it would be harder to do so from someone who is not trans. So maybe practice empathy with trans friends. Continue what you are doing with listening and being open-minded.
Yes, this is a good way of thinking about it.
I think it‚Äôs on HBO? And if you want more a have a couple others up my sleeve
I had hoped not to try to make it your responsibility to tell me and explain to me, hence the years of me doing research on my own. As a non white person, I understand the feeling of resentment one may have when others feel they are owed my experience. 

I appreciate you telling me your experiences and I hope that I will be able to make use of this knowledge. I tend to think of things in a factual way and less in the emotional way, perhaps spending more time reading personal experiences and attempting to relate to them would help. Thank you.
ohhh, thx, yes plese I need new shows to watch and I can't take any more cis/het shows that have 1 gay person and cast it as a LGBTQIA+ show lmaoo
Gentlemen Jack- haven‚Äôt gotten around to watching it yet, but it seems really great. Is about a very butch lesbian in the 1700‚Äôs I think. Fairly sure it‚Äôs based on a real story too.

Good Omens- Based on a book by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Cishet ppl probably wouldn‚Äôt realise it‚Äôs queer, and nothing is actually shown, but it is still very much queer. The two main characters are enby and very much In Love. Neil Gaiman has stated that a) they‚Äôre in love b) s2 is going too be ‚Äúsoft and romantic‚Äú. (and every single character they meet in the book immediatly thinks the‚Äôre gay)

What we do in the shadows- A mockumentary about vampire. Very casually queer, but it isn‚Äôt focused on that. Still good tho.

Heaven Official‚Äôs blessing- kinda more anime than show, but still just fantastic. Based on the novels with the same name, and there is also a comic version with absolutely stunning art that you can read (for free) online.

I see you already know Heartstopper.

Hope you find something you like (:
Thank youu, sorry for the late reply, I fell asleep, but thanks again :))

Does anyone else ever get super dysphoric seeing groups of girls out and about?	I was at the casino with my friends this weekend celebrating his birthday and there were so many beautiful women walking around super dressed up and it just made me so dysphoric/ depressed i had to go back to the hotel room and just stay in there. I wish that were me. I think i no longer leave my house/ do anything socially subconsciously because i get mad/sad seeing girls having fun.	"Absolutely. You‚Äôre not the only one. At my work, the men and women often go out in separate groups for lunch and every time I wish the women would invite me. I‚Äôve never felt so envious.
Yeah it gives me fomo cuz I don't feel I will ever have a group of girly friends
very much so, feels like i don‚Äôt fit in
Yes.
Yes
Yep, pain.
Yeah, second-hand dysphoria **hurts** :(
This one hits home for a lot of us!!!! 
I think it‚Äôs because we feel bad for being jealous, because we‚Äôve seen how toxic a trait it can be, but sometimes we just can‚Äôt help but wish we were able to just be there without all the extra steps life has thrown at us. 
It‚Äôd be nice if there were a switch right? 
God that would be nice!!!! But yeah I feel it too sometimes, and me oh my can it be debilitating sometimes.
I don‚Äôt because I‚Äôm ftm but similarly to it, I often get dysphoric when watching male sports irl.
I trained some martial arts for a bit but everytime i got out feeling extremely dysphoric and sad so I quit (and for some other reason, like having to use my deadname and would pros badly have to participate in the woman‚Äôs team)
I did before I came out.

Now I'm one of the girls üëß
Always
Yes, like honestly i think my introversion since gender roles got hammered into my head as a kid is due to dysphoria bc like i never got to be the girl and woman i am for all these years. I‚Äôve always hated shopping for boy clothes unless it‚Äôs jogging pants and graphic tees/hoodies. I‚Äôve always been envious of girls fashion, and like even though as a ‚Äúguy‚Äù people have complimented me calling me handsome or cute or whatever else have you, i was never able to like appreciate that bc i want to be beautiful and pretty, not handsome üòû
This is what kills me - baby showers and girls nights out.  I wanna go too!  Very frustrating, and jealousy is a thing for sure!!"	yucomt	trans	43	0.9	2022-11-13 20:14:10

My mom doesn't like that I'm trans	"For a long time she told me it's a phase and that I'm not really a boy and she wouldn't let me cut my hair so I started cutting it myself so she gave up. She said she wouldn't use pronouns at all and she didn't need to talk about me like I'm not there. She said ""well you can pretend you're a boy"" or ""you're confused"" it didn't matter how much I reminded her. My old therapist actually said ""she can't be transphobic because she's okay with gay people"". They talked about using different pronouns but my mom never actually did. I wasn't allowed to get a chest binder because she thought it was dangerous and I wasn't allowed to wear male clothes. For a solid 2 years I didn't talk about it. Until today I brought it up and she said ""well it always changes"" (it doesn't) and she just ignored me and went into the basement to smoke. I don't understand how she can get mad by my gender identity. I've been out for 4 years."	"i feel you i been out to my parents that im trans to a boy for 2 years no acsoect not buying mens cloths no chest binder no leting me cut my hair nothing it sucks i get that ....your not alone
Ah! Denial! How doth thou lay in such regal repose? A monarch upon thy throne of ashes! No flame doth dance thereupon thee, though a warmth of summer exceeding do you know. No smoke canst thou taste, though a crown most hazy doth thou wear. Thy hall of timbers in black and red, most grandly doth it fall. Nary a well shall thou seek. No rain may intrude upon thee. Oh, denial! Most regal art thou upon thy throne of ash in the court of char and bone.

Also, I think your old therapist might not know what transgender means.
It's not her choice
My mom hates that I‚Äôm trans too. She even asked me to detransition, basically telling me that she‚Äôd prefer if I were a dead man than a happy woman. 

She didn‚Äôt quite realize that‚Äôs what she said, but one can‚Äôt just simply change the meanings of words on the fly. 

Your mom is dealing with a lot. 

Almost all of it brought about by her own hangups and bigotry, but thems the breaks. 

If she won‚Äôt talk to you face to face, the best thing, in my opinion, would be to get a therapist that isn‚Äôt an incompetent twatwaffle and start working with them on how to bridge the gap between the two of you. 

Failing that, start throwing suicide rates in her face. It‚Äôll just make the whole situation significantly worse, but then she‚Äôll have to come to terms with which she prefers, a happy son or a dead daughter.
""She can't be transphobic because shes okay with gay people."" - What? Time for a new therapist? WTF does being gay and transphobia have to do with each other.
First off, your old therapist is a dumbass. 

Second, the only real piece of advice I can give is to surround yourself with people who support you. Friends, or supportive family members. It does not have to include your mom. And if it doesn't, then it's entirely her fault for not accepting you for you.
Your mom sounds like a real b*tch. Best advice is move just out when you can and ghost her. Do what makes you happy man."	ql55a4	trans	47	0.96	2021-11-02 14:14:24

I had been working up the courage to tell her. I told her last week I had to tell her something but I couldn‚Äôt go through with it. Well today she asked me if I had mascara on (I‚Äôm clearly not the best taking my makeup off lol). That‚Äôs when I decided to tell her. It took a while as I flounder and beat around the bush. 

When I told her I was trans she was so very accepting of me. She told me the only reason she‚Äôs mad is because I didn‚Äôt tell her sooner that I was trans. She wants to help get me on HRT and told me she would take me shopping for clothes and help me with everything!! Im not even sure this is even real. I‚Äôve battled for 21 years and it‚Äôs finally becoming a reality. I don‚Äôt have to hide and pretend anymore!!!!

Thank you so much I appreciate your kind words so much!! Sounds exactly how my experience went. She came at me with open arms and I was just so shocked.

Yes I still look like a man I just started my HRT 3 months ago. But when I go to you saying that i identify as transgender please don't call me a man. The reaction should be ""I'm sorry I didn't know, i won't do it again"" instead she reacted saying ""you're just being hypersensitive you shouldn't bring your personal ideology problems to work, this isn't your house"" after that she kept talking but i was too mad to pay attention.

Halloween - providing me with a safe 'it's just as a joke' excuse for what will hopefully be the last time (*fingers crossed*). Alice Liddell from Alice: Madness Returns, for those who haven't played the game		"Great idea, looks good. That was a twisted game.
Yoooo i wanna do an alice costume i might but idk where ill get changed n stuff
Thanks! Yeah, I love the darker twist on the Alice in Wonderland story. From the (admittedly fairly limited) time I've spent on psychiatric wards as a house surgeon, hallucinogenic/delusional systems are rarely as terror-light as the original. Somewhat off-topic, but I've always wondered why the human psyche resorts to the really dark stuff so readily in mental illness. I'm yet to meet many people who are under the delusion that their neighbors have their best interests at heart and are leaving cookies on their porch, for example
Do you still live with your parents or something? If so, idk about your folks, but when I lived at home so long as I was acting like it was all a big joke, my parents were always happy to roll their eyes and ignore it. Will yours not even let you do that?
Yea i still live w my fam n im not out im honestly just too scared to plus my mum already knows i shave my legs n stuff so shes pretty sus that and i have longer hair too so shes vvvvvv sus rn
‚òπ sorry to hear that. My mum caught me with full eye makeup the other day, but thankfully she later told my sister she thought I was going through an emo phase! I'm 27, so that'd be one heck of a quarter life crisis haha
Lmaooo god ive almost been caught so many times w my wig n girl stuff on luckily the adrenaline rush to take it all off is massive i end up shaking and swearing every time its horrible
I know them feels - I haven't lived at home in a decade and I'm still terrified of what my parents will do when they find out!
Damn im still rlly young so moving out isnt rlly an option to me until i turn 18 but i wanna be out before then so idk shits hard
Do you 100% know your parents views re: trans people? Maybe bring up trans issues organically (pick something that's currently in the news, so you can say you just read about it) and see how they react to it
Not really shes just got a bit of boomer politics n she agrees w jk rowling to a certain extent which aint great but she isnt exactly transphobic
Well that's good - maybe they'd react better than you think?
Probably but she wasnt v accepting of me being bi which is scary n i feel like shed joke about it which sux
While joking about it is pretty shitty, at least it doesn't sound like they'd throw you out of the house or anything - small mercies. In time, I'm sure she'd come to understand how important this is to you

Help! Trans youth being cyber bullied	"My trans male son is being targeted by an Instagram account using an account name that implies it is our school district's special education program (account: hlww_sped). The account also ridicules others. We've reported it to the school and to Instagram. Ideally, I'd love to find a way to identify the account holder (know anyone with mad skilz?). Realistically, all I can likely do is get more people to review and report the account.

If any of you can help out in any way, please do so. Even if it's just spreading the word, or encouraging people to visit that Instagram account and make a report. On the behalf of my son, Arlo, and the rest of our family, I thank you."	"Only thing I can think of is attempting to log into the account and pretending you forgot the password so you can see part of the email adress
Reported it for you. I would advise everyone reading to do the same.
In germany we tell the police and most of them, if they care do go after such accounts.
That is awful. Sorry your family is having to deal with this. Reported it as hate speech.
Why not just block the account and move on?
Seems like it would just save alot of hassle in the long run.

There's going to be bullies at every step of the journey, gotta learn to ignore them and tune them out.
Block it first and then if they try doing anything else making a new account etc file for harassment also ask some ethical hackers they love this kinda stuff just provide them with proof of what's going on and watch the magic (if not you can hire one on some less reputable sites to get control of the account) not that I condone this action
Scam that fucker out of their account. üòä
Thanks, all. As of today, the account is down!
I wouldn't have thought of that. Now we know that the account holder's phone number ends ""56"".
Andy Grote approves.
The problem with blocking it is that it really does nothing to address the problem. All reporting it does is blocks the reporting user from seeing the offense of contract. Blocking them does the same. It allows them to continue with the same behavior, bullying other people.

In the last 24 hours, we've seen one of the offensive posts come down (one that compared a girl of average build to a hippo), but simply blocking the account is putting the burden of responsibility on the target of the bullying."	rutu69	trans	43	0.91	2022-01-03 05:16:49
Can you believe they prescribe corrective lenses to children?! /s	There was a time when if a child had difficulty seeing the board they were moved up to the front of the class, or they just copied one of their friends notes. Now doctors are forcing kids to wear metal and plastic on their face, even convincing some to put plastic in their eyes to see better! It‚Äôs completely unnatural and discourages kids from trying harder to learn in class! As an adult older than 40 with no kids I feel it is my civic duty to spread awareness of these ocular atrocities doctors are forcing onto children! Kids should have to wait until they‚Äôre in their 20‚Äôs before being allowed to decide if they want corrective lenses or not! It‚Äôs too big of a decision to make when they‚Äôre young and don‚Äôt know any better! Heck, I‚Äôm not sure these ‚Äòopticians‚Äô know what they‚Äôre doing; they weren‚Äôt around in my day, and I turned out fine. My neighbour‚Äôs kid got glasses, and ended up being hit by a car, probably because they didn‚Äôt see the car coming! We must stop this madness! Won‚Äôt somebody please think of the children!?! /s	"It's just a fad, like ""[left handedness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_against_left-handed_people)"".
I know this is a parody and it's a good one, haha, but they actually did under prescribe my lenses as a kid because they thought that prescribing the full amount would make my eyes worse. Under prescribing probably was worse for my eyes than prescribing the correct lenses in the first place would have been
You‚Äôre not ACTUALLY left handed you‚Äôre just doing it because it‚Äôs cool and trendy /s

My mom called me a TRANSVESTITE	I've been pretty depressed recently only getting up to go to work then sleeping. I've skipped school for over a month and a half now, and have been forced to meet with a therapist a lot. I came out to my therapist and she pressured me to tell my mom, and so I did mh mom seemed chill about it and never mentioned it for over two weeks. Then four days ago she started getting mad at me for being depressed and sleeping so began insulting me and making noise. Today she not only called me a transvestite, but also told me I was faking being trans and depressed. She has also been purposefully using he/him instead of she/her.	"Well that is not okay. Honestly, I hope it gets better. If something like this happens in my family, I would talk about it with them (well I would talk, they would have to listen). If you need someone to talk to, I'm here. Maybe letting some steam out will help you. Or if not talking to a person, maybe something like ""Books of thoughts"" could help (I personally have one)... Either way you have my full support and if you need anything, let me know üòäüòäüòä
That's another problem my mom always tells me I never open up to her, in the past 3 months I tried three times. And every time she either ignored the main issues, distorted my words or over emphasized a minor detail.üò≠ Where do u recon I can get a book of thoughts, barnes and nobles or just amazon?
Suggestion: Tell her this is why you don‚Äôt open up to her. Say ‚ÄúMom, how can you expect me to open up to you if you‚Äôre gonna be hateful whenever I do? I‚Äôm only going to open up to someone who treats me like a human.‚Äù

Maybe she‚Äôll get some perspective.
To the mom problem - I have that too... It's annoying and I stopped talking to them and then they are mad when they learn something from someone else, well the problem is not on our side, so there's nothing more we can do.

To the book of thoughts - just basic notebook (or a document in Word). It's basically like a diary, but instead of saying how your day went, you write about the issue that you want to deal with. I basically try to talk (write a monologue) with the book itself as if it's a person
She might be ignoring you opening up to her because it's not what she wants to hear. She wants a pre-transition son back, and she can't accept (yet) what she sees as a new version of you. 

In her mind, you being trans is like losing her son, because she doesn't realize your transition isn't like erasing who you are, but being yourself. If it feels comfortable, maybe remind her that you're still her child, you're just a side she hasn't gotten to know yet.
I did that and she ignored the me.üôÇüëç

No problem! It sucks that there are people like that in the world. Please know that you are an excellent mum to your son for supporting him.
Its alright maybe I am making them that way because unlike my toxic phobic family I gave my child the love and safety to be able to explore themselves at a young age without judgment.  I don't see that as a bad thing at all. Im breaking the abuse cycle for sure.
I usually avoid subs and posts that aren't or even give a hint that they aren't trans friendly. This post blew me away because the OP was commenting on how some subs have a ""hate boner"" for trans people.
No. You're not. I truly believe exploring gender identity is evolutionary. You and your child are more evolved than most. On good days, this is what I tell myself.
My son is 15. Puberty is done for him and he is also done growing. It's unfortunate that he didn't figure out that he was trans sooner...but thats just the way his journey went. We are also seeing a gender therapist, a behavioral health therapist, and after 6 months we will be seeing an endocrinologist as well. My son is not bottom.dysphoric and doesn't want bottom surgery. At least not now. He is uncomfortable with his breast tissue and I don't blame him. He's a DD and he's only 5' tall. We are discussing a radical reduction as a first step, and also hormones to change his voice.
Yeah. A lot of subs have some horrible people on them. I looked at the post you were talking about and so many of the transphobic comments are being upvoted while you and other supporting trans people (including the OP) are being downvoted. I just can't believe how horrible some people can be in life.
Just know you are doing the best for your child and also the suicide rates of trans kids who try and do kill themselves because their family doesn't accept them is very high.. I think its 71% try and at least 40% actually go through with it. Why would you wanna play with those odds? I never got the chance to explore my gender or sexuality but I figured out at a young age what it was. I am now going on 31 and just really started my transition. If I could have had what I am giving my child now.. I would have happily done it. We are going through therapy because of WPATH guidelines for my doctor to be able to get hormone blockers until my child figures out how they wish to transition.

Best Easter Ever	"For context, I‚Äôve been out to my mom and dad for a solid two months. I recently came out to my aunt, and she decided to out me to our entire immediate family. She did not do this out of malicious intent and was just doing what she thought was right with what she believed to be public information. I am not mad at her in the slightest. 
Well, yesterday, I had the best experience I could have ever hoped for. My whole family came down for Easter. My grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, and ofc, my parents. We went out to eat, and then had a beautiful day at the beach; walking around and playing in the water. It first started with my uncle, who I haven‚Äôt seen in months. He pulled me to the side and said he wanted to catch up. After a couple minutes of friendly conversation, he asks me when I started feeling this way. He reassured me that he‚Äôll love me no matter what, and asked me if I had a preferred name and pronouns. It was amazing. 
Later in the day, I was pulled aside by more family members, my grandparents. They weren‚Äôt that subtle; starting the conversation off by outwardly asking if I was a boy lol. After saying yes, we had a really good talk about how I was feeling. They were amazing, asking me what they could call me to make me feel more comfortable, telling me that they‚Äôll love me no matter who I chose to be, and that they just want me to be safe growing up in this world. 
I basically had the same convo with the family I was already out to, but even if I‚Äôve already heard it before from them, it was still so meaningful. 
As my family and I were running around, playing in the water, making sand castles and having a good laugh. I couldn‚Äôt hold back my tears as I realized that I had a family that really loved me, that if I were fully transitioned, standing on this beach with them in 5 years, nothing would change, and they‚Äôd still love me for who I was."	"Awww!!! I'm so glad they were all understanding! And that you had a good time at the beach! That's amazing!
Ooookay, this seriously made my heart melt ü•∫üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è I am so happy for you Rowan! Congratulations on being so courageous to come out to your family! (i don‚Äôt care who disagrees, coming out to anyone - even yourself - is the scariest thing I‚Äôve ever done) And kudos for them being so genuine and accepting and proactive!

That's so great! Congratulations! Living out is the best, especially when you have a good family behind you. Super heartwarming! Thanks for sharing.
you come from a long line of loving family.I am so happy for you. Hugs from a mom.
I'm happy yours was better than mine, it wasn't bad it was I was just feeling tired and antisocial even tho it was just with siblings, parent and grandparents.
That is beautiful! My family is also entirely accepting of my being a woman, however, since I moved to a different country, we haven't been able to meet, and won't for another year and a half. I really look forward to the day when I can actually spend time with them as a woman and be part of the family again, even if it's only for a visit.
Tysm, it really was the best day ever. I really appreciate you for reading, I‚Äôm hoping that my family and my story could encourage and give hope to anyone else who reads it üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm so glad that this story resonated with you and gave you hope for yourself and other trans people! Aside from just sharing an amazing experience, I wanted people to see that there is hope for them before/after coming out. I really appreciate you for reading and sharing your kind words üòä‚ù§Ô∏è have a great day/night!
It really is üòä thanks for reading!!
You‚Äôre amazing, tysm for your kind words üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm sorry that yours wasn‚Äôt good, or what you were hoping for. You‚Äôre not alone though, and I hope that my post at least gave you some hope that things change, and that everything will turn out fine in the end. Have an amazing day/night ‚ù§Ô∏è
I am so glad to hear that your family is accepting of you, that is such an amazing thing. I‚Äôm sorry that you haven‚Äôt been able to see them, but I hope that when you do, you can make some new memories with them as your true self and they can get to know you for the amazing woman that you are ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I just paid ¬£60 for a gender clinic lady to berate me for not being an expert in hormones and not having a plan for when (not if) my parents kick me out.	"I was on a call today for my first gender clinic appointment and I was super nervous (obviously).

The lady was super harsh to me and based on her expression and hand movements, she looks so fucking exasperated and tired as I stumbled over my words and had trouble answering her questions.

She seemed mad when I wanted to talk about aspects like top surgery, when ""we're here to talk about hormones."" Which by the way, the appointment wasn't even supposed to be about hormones, just about what I was expecting from the clinic in general.

She didn't seem to understand that I wasn't interested in looking super masculine or having things like facial hair and an adams apple, despite telling her I am nonbinary, want to look a little more androgynous and don't hate being feminine by any means. At times she was jumping to conclusions and putting words in my mouth.

Then she moved onto my family, I'm sat in my room terrified that my parents will come home and hear this conversation. I told her I'm not close with them and honestly haven't thought about their reaction to me being nonbinary. She seemed pissed and told me I need to think about a plan for when (not if, when) they kick me out of the house. She also wasn't happy about me only having ¬£280 per month to spend on hormones and wasn't exactly sure of how much they cost.


She wants me to make another appointment. She wants me to spend another ¬£60 for her to basically shoot down what little confidence I have left in my gender identity.

Am I even nonbinary or am I just faking it."	"You‚Äôre not faking anything. That bitch needs to be fired
This person is acting grossly inappropriate. I would suggest reporting her as asking for another clinician. I don't know how it works where you live, but I would consider a completely different clinic entirely.

She shouldn't absolutely not treat you this way. You do not need to tolerate this unprofessional behavior from someone who's job is to educate and inform.

Sorry that you experienced this. ü´Ç
Hold up though OP, testosterone is no joke and you don‚Äôt get to pick and choose side effects.  You say you don‚Äôt want facial hair but facial/body hair, potential male pattern baldness, voice changes, etc. are all very real and either irreversible or expensive/time consuming to reverse.

I don‚Äôt say this to discourage you, but you absolutely do need to be informed about all of this before considering HRT.  That‚Äôs the whole point of informed consent.

I also get that you‚Äôre probably upset, but I‚Äôll be honest, she‚Äôs talking to you like a real person in the real world.  No one is going to hold your hand out there.  You might not like that but you need to get used to it, no one is going to coddle you like in this sub.
PLEASE name and shame, so others don't have to deal with her
Assuming you're in the UK. Can I ask which clinic are you using? ¬£280 is way too much. For my private clinic is was ¬£300 for the first appointment and ¬£150 for the others for around 3 per year.

Careful that you don't get taken advantage of.
Talking to these people are hard as it's like a weird situation and new. Of course you'll be anxious. But you paid for a service so some switch bitch to tell you what's what is not on. I'd put in a complaint
I understand that which is why I wanted more time to discuss it with a professional and maybe talk about microdosing.

Either way I don't think it's appropriate to ignore the things I am interested in doing like top surgery and tell me that I need to plan for when my parents will kick me out the house.
Jayne Olden from GenderGP.
They're not asking for ¬£280, she just seemed to be angry at me because I can't afford hormones with the benefits that I'm currently on.

I definitely won't spend another penny on seeing her again.
Microdosing still doesn‚Äôt let you control effects though.  You need to be prepared for the full effects of testosterone as everyone‚Äôs body is different in how their body responds to HRT.

I think the person has genuine concern for you and was trying to raise the more immediate things you need to deal with.  I get they‚Äôre not the things you *want* to talk about but they‚Äôre the things you *need* to talk about.
Again, I'm not the one trying to force myself into taking testosterone. She literally didn't want to speak another word to me unless it was about testosterone.

I just wanted to talk about how I want to look more androgynous and get top surgery and how I'm still comfortable with enjoying feminine things.

That doesn't give her the right to make me question my identity and give me the fear of my parents making me homeless for being trans.
Ah I see, my apologies, I thought you meant you did want to start on testosterone.  In terms of top surgery if you‚Äôre an adult I‚Äôd agree that‚Äôs your body, your choice."	yscyc8	trans	42	0.9	2022-11-11 15:01:35
I got publicly outed üòí	"(For context I‚Äôm mtf 40 years old Australia )

So I‚Äôve been out to a few close friends and family ( just the people I could trust ) for about a year now but I was going to wait to publicly come out until I was comfortable and had made some decent progress ( which I haven‚Äôt so far, apparent late bloomer).

Well I got a message saying that they knew what I was going through and that I should let a particular person know first hand before they heard it on the grapevine ( being vague for privacy reasons). Apparently it‚Äôs the talk of the town but no one has thought to ask me about it, just take gossip at the gospel.

Turns out someone I trusted decided that the potential gossip was worth more to them than my privacy and outed me against my wishes. I‚Äôm not even that mad really, just really disappointed.

So yeah, I‚Äôm now out, not happy about it but it‚Äôs done, so hello world I‚Äôm Jen ü§ôüèª"	"<waves> Hi Jen!  Huggles and glad you have found yourself!!!

I'm also totally outed to everyone.  I just owned it at work, on facebook, and everywhere!  I even managed to announce myself right before my high school 20 year anniversary... which apparently became the fun topic of the day.  At this point I just assume anyone I've known in the past knows I'm trans <shrugs>

At least we are beautiful awesome people with a touch of rainbow to make us fantastic!

Being approached at the gym	"Backstory: ‚Ä¶ yesterday, I attended TDOR ‚ÄúTransgender Day of Remembrance‚Äù

I and a few other trans individuals were interviewed about our transition & the video project was presented at TDOR.

the amount of unconditional love and radiance that poured over me at this event AND after was so grand

A moment of celebration dedicated to US. And the trans people that lived before us.. who‚Äôs lives were taken due to transphobia. (RIP‚ù§Ô∏è)

It was a day I‚Äôll never forget.

The next day
(this morning)

 I did something I‚Äôve never done. WAKE UP AT 6AM and go to the gym. 

Within 4 minutes of warming up, I saw this cis dude kept looking at me.. lol
 I wasn‚Äôt nervous or anything tbh..

He then approached me and asked how I dyed my hair. I could barely hear what he was saying because one of my headphones was in. He later approached me again & said ‚Äúsorry if I offended you
I called you mad‚Äù

I was so confused lol but I also was way too in the zone to careüò≠and ask why he was talking about so I was like ‚Äúnah ur good bro‚Äù

My sister then told me ‚Äúhe called you man‚Äù

(Great, because I am) 

I now realize he was probably genuinely confused with my identity. LMAO but I really respect that he was so considerate of whether he offended me or not 


The 2 others that approached me complimented me.

And I gotta say, last nights event had such a big influence on me.

I‚Äôm sharing this story so that I never forget and so others are reminded of how loved you are. 

Whether you‚Äôre accepted by society, your family or whoever or not 

You have people that love you and value who you are somewhere in the world. Trust they are making their way to you ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôm so done. It‚Äôs tiring to hate myself everyday.	"Everyday is torture to me. I live with the fact that i‚Äôm trans, i beat myself up for it so much. I hate my body, my chest makes me uncomfortable, i‚Äôll never pass as a boy, IT‚ÄôS THE SAME THOUGHTS EVERYDAY. And i‚Äôll hate myself for liking anything about myself in the slightest. But y‚Äôknow what? Today i‚Äôm blocking those thoughts out. I deserve love just like anyone else. I suffered everyday wishing i was someone else but today i‚Äôll accept who i am. It‚Äôs likely that tomorrow i‚Äôll feel like total crap but right now is not that time. I‚Äôm so mad that even if nobody loves me i make it worse by not loving myself too. 

I‚Äôm worthy of love, the least i can do is give myself that love if nobody else will. I‚Äôm a boy. I know who i am. And i‚Äôm proud of that."	"That is nice! You absolutely are a boy, and you will pass eventually - it is almost certain.
You're so worthy of love! And try to not beat yourself up for feeling dysphoria. It's possible to love yourself and simultaneously not love certain parts of your body. 

Highly recommend going to therapy if you're not already. Therapy has done amazing things for me. 

I hope you have a good day!
I remember a point when I gave myself permission to not hate myself for five minutes. I even told myself not to worry, because the self hate would come back after my break. 

Then I closed my eyes, and imagined what it would be like. It was so beautiful. I was so f‚Äôn happy. 

After the five minutes the self hate came back, but I had changed. I had a souvenir. I had experienced life without the self hate. That feeling stayed with me. It helped me stop hating myself for wanting to a girl. It made me realize that I was wrong. That I could be a lot happier if I stopped hating this part of myself that makes me happy.
Your absolutely right, it's hard to hold all that pain when you go to war with yourself.  Dysphoria sucks, but be patient and understanding with yourself.  Hugs, you deserve them ü§ó"	wfvleu	trans	37	0.96	2022-08-04 08:16:37

Well, my mother discovered that I have been hiding girl clothes	"It didn't go well. I tried to explain but it seems meaningless. Her reaction was unexpected, I never thought she would be so mad.

I have no idea why I'm feeling so calm after that, guess I started to becone emotionless (I'm 15 by the way)"	"that sucks, u deserve better
I‚Äôm sorry. This is an experience many of us have had and will have. Parental Love does not equal unconditional love. They usually (subconsciously) want their children to be like they are; I reckon this is why people don‚Äôt usually adopt.
I went through this about your age and it traumatised me very deeply. From your mothers perspective she probably feels like she's done something wrong and is trying to nip it in the bud real quick. If you genuinely feel its right for you, do not let it go and keep going. 

Initially my mother fed my want for female clothes, she bought me female underwear, nightclothes etc. But it emotionally drained her. We did end up seeing a doctor and he just said it was a phase and told me I'd grow out of it, etc. I never did. I should have transitioned but instead I have led a ridiculous false existence pretending to be a man.
I have been there at your age in that position and remember those feelings very clearly when my mum found my clothes.

I hate the way my age gets used against me all the time	"I'm a 15 almost 16 year old non binary person, and everytime I'm answering a transphobe/homophobe or discussing with someone they always use my age ad a way to invalidate my argument 

This happens both in real life and on the internet, I almost never put my age on my profiles on the internet because of things like this, but recently I did because I was interested in a girl and since my profile on Instagram is private she would only be able to see my bio 

It makes me extremely mad since I can site sources, videos, articles, but just because im a minor or younger than them that makes my argument invalid and the exist of trans people also invalid (I don't know how)"	"At least that's an easy way to tell an intellectually dishonest person.

No honest person does that.
Older people use their age all the time to cover up shit arguments. Its been like this forever. Respect your elders blah blah blah.

Im sorry but to me it just seems you're arguing with people that dont deserve the argument. Gotta move on and keep fighting.
Ok, boomer. Oh, wait, that‚Äôs me. Yup, it totally sucks to be judged solely by your age. A young person can have a fully informed opinion, while someone older has unfounded beliefs. Don‚Äôt worry about those who invalidate your position based on superficial traits; focus on presenting a solid argument. People who discount you for your age will likely do so for other, equally unreasonable reasons. Hang in there!
When there's no evidence supporting their claims they have to scrape the barrel for ""arguments""
I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs and I‚Äôll have arguments with my grandfather where he still pulls this bullshit. 

I‚Äôm convinced that by the time you‚Äôre old enough that people stop calling you too young to have informed opinions, they‚Äôll just immediately switch to calling you old and out of touch. 

So the bad news is that you can‚Äôt change people like this. The good news is that you can choose not to give them any more of your time.
Yeah
Yeah, normally I never argue with them, but in every comment section (specially Instagram) when you try to educate someone who wants to learn a flock of transphobes just appear to try and argue"	10dl4pr	trans	38	0.91	2023-01-16 17:30:50
The story of how my ex called the cops on me when I came out as transgender.	"Okay so back in May of 2019 my brain finally put it together that I may in fact be transgender. I talked to a mtf friend of mine about it and she helped me organize my thoughts about it and agreed that I'm transgender. 

That was all well and good, however I then had to tell my now ex about it since we were still in an online ""relationship"" at the time (I put it in quotes because it was so toxic and horrible that I don't consider it an actual relationship anymore). So I texted her about it.

She. Was. Pissed. She thought I was joking at first, but when I said I was serious she went full transphobe on me. She has a track record for freaking out of things don't go her way, going as far as making threats of self harm and suicide if I didn't do what she says (she doesn't actually hurt herself btw, just says she will to manipulate me). I asked my mtf friend what to do because I was terrified and she said that I gotta tell her that I need a little space to think about it and then cut her off. So I did just that.

About half an hour later two police officers knock on my door wanting to speak with me. Apparently my ex called them so they could ""check on me"". Yeah right... I could tell she was trying to scare me into going back to her and I knew better than to do that. However I had to explain wtf was going on. Since the idea of lying to the police sounded like a really bad idea, I was forced to come out as transgender to my parents (who didn't understand and were pretty transphobic about it) AND the police. I was not at all ready to be out of the egg. I just figured that out about myself earlier that day! 

The next day after the dust had settled I got an email from my ex. She was trying to feed me some kind of bullshit excuse as to why she freaked out. Apparently it was because she once knew someone who was ""transrender"" that bullied her in the past. Thats not a typo btw, she stated it several times in the email. I Googled it to see what that was. Spoiler alert: It's not even a fucking word. On top of that, when I showed my mtf friend the email, it turned out that she got the same excuse from her after she harassed her for being trans. That was the last straw. I replied to the email with a declaration of our break-up and I never talked to that bitch ever again.

And then she hacked into my Google account and send me creepy pics of herself to me through my own email address. :) 

Dear Google,
Could you please make it easier for me to change my password and re-secure my account? I had to ask around on Discord, while in full panic mode, for help figuring out that stuff. 

I did get my account back, thankfully. I never heard from that psycho again. 

Anyway I hope y'all have an easier time coming out than I did lol. That was a Tuesday that I'll never forget. Scary af but also a major turning point in my life. Things haven't gotten much easier, but my life has definitely been gradually improving. When I was with my ex I was forced to sit in my room for 8 -10 hours a day watching videos with her like cats mating or pimple popping or the same fucking Warriors MAP over and over and over again (I don't read or like Warriors and she'd get mad at me for not understanding what was going on in the video). No food. No bathroom breaks. Not even allowed to talk to friends or family. That was my life for two years. 

Now that I'm free of that nightmare I got a job, a driver's permit, friends I can hang out with, an HRT prescription, parents that finally understand and respect me, started practicing witchcraft, and best of all... I got a new boyfriend who actually loves and cares about me and my health. He doesn't force me to do things I'm not comfortable with, doesn't guilt trip me, showers me with love and affection (as I do with him), and treats me like a human being who has basic needs and NOT like an object to toy with. He's as sweet and snuggly as can be a I love him so much! I love you, Ray! <3

Sorry this post was so long. That was unintentional lol. I hope y'all have a wonderful day! Trans rights! ^^/"	"I'm glad to hear you're in a better place in your life now. Good luck with the future. :)

Do you ever wish you could start over? Even as trans?	"So, I'm trans, MTF. I'm 25. I started my transition in late 2019 and recently finally had SRS. I still have a couple surgeries in mind, but anyways...

&#x200B;

Do you ever wish you could start your life over? Whether it be as your chosen gender, or even as trans with the knowledge you have now?

I know people may get mad at me for saying this, but even though I started my transtion at 23, I feel like I started it way too late and missed out on so much.

Schooling from the beginning all the way to HS, was pretty horrible for me. Because I was trans (but didn't know) it caused me to be depressed. I was the loner in the back of each class. I missed out on so much because I just wasn't happy, and wasn't a girl.

I DREAM about being able to go back, even just to HS, and start off as I am now, or as a girl, and living through everything again but finally being myself. I cry about this so often because I feel like I missed out on some of the most fun, or most important childhood stuff. I didnt get to live through what it's like being a girl during HS. Even the bad parts. I don't care. I missed out on all of those experiences and it kills me knowing I only have one life & it's so fucked up already.

I have been told that sometimes I act like a kid, or childish. I don't do it purposely, but have been told & feel like I am almost living out those years, now. My room is overly feminine. The things I say or do, are somthing a teenaged girl would say/do. My friend said it was almost like I was going through the years and learning and doing things. Or maybe that that side of me is just finally living itself out.

Regardless, I have the realization that I can't focus on what I've lost anymore. It really sucks. But I know if I spend the next couple years wishing I could go back and change everything, I will end up 5 years down the line wishing I didn't spend the last few years reminiscing. If that makes sense.

'Time' by Pink Floyd reminds me that before I know it, time will pass and I'll still be no where wishing things were different.

I feel like I have already lost most of my life because I'm trans, and it's hard, really hard, letting go of that and moving on with my head up high happy for the future.

Idk. I'm not depressed. I plan on finishing my transition with the last couple of surgeries I have, and moving on with my life, but fuck I really fucking wish I could go back even 10 years.

I look at my life so far. Optimistally, I have 40 years left. That's so fucking scary. Maybe it's human nature to look back and wish we could regain time/change things. But it feels especially unfair as a trans person.

Anyone else feel the same way, or sorta like this?  


(Edit, I am at work but will reply & respond as I can)"	"I do get the occasional, ""I wish I had started transitioning sooner,"" or ""If I had just been born a cis woman, life would be easier."" I think my experiences are valuable not only to myself but to others who have to go through the same things I have. Going back or starting over completely would be nice, but I'm more or less okay how things turned out and look forward to the future.
While it wasn‚Äôt as drastic for me I totally relate to this. Am going to see a gender therapist at 22 after longer time of self-denial. However I feel like before this age and all the experiences I had I wouldn‚Äôt ever have been ready to transition. And ofc it would‚Äôve been easier being born as our real genders. But since we already missed out on so much I feel like we shouldn‚Äôt look back in regret and fear of having missed out and rather spent our remaining time in happiness and joy of what‚Äôs to come!
I totally get it‚Ä¶I‚Äôm ftm and i started transitioning when i was 14. I guess that is pretty young but it took so long to get to where i am now at 19. I sometimes get so bogged down and wishing that i could relive everything, childhood and high-school especially. I feel really really sad when i look at old photos of me from childhood, because all i wish for is to go back to that point and do it over. I‚Äôd dream that i was a cis guy all along and what my childhood and high-school life would have been like. other times i fantasise going back in time and transitioning as a young child, and getting to experience a better transition, perhaps a bit less awkward than what it was actually like. Again i know 14 is young still (although from what i see online very common), but i didn‚Äôt get on hrt until i was 18, so highschool was a very weird experience of looking incredibly awkward, rarely passing and having some horrific fashion to compensate for feeling inadequate for not being masculine enough. But i‚Äôm also happy that i got in early, and i could get top surgery and hormones when i did. I bet that if you had transitioned at 14 or whatever, you‚Äôd feel bad about not transitioning sooner, its never really enough i guess. (and i feel bad for being so jealous of those really young trans kids who get to bypass the awkward early transition teen/young adult phase).I‚Äôm a very nostalgic person and i always like to think back to the past rather than the present, so i really get that feeling of being caught in a reminiscing cycle, i always find myself creating scenarios of how it could have been, what i wish it was etc and it makes me really depressed, but i‚Äôm working on it. I‚Äôm now trying to focus that energy on the future and what it can be, sounds hella cheesy but it feels more healthy. i didn‚Äôt get the teenage experience that i wish i had, but i‚Äôm going to make sure my adult years are better, (and if they suck‚Ä¶we‚Äôll at least they will suck whilst i‚Äôm a transitioned fully passing man).
Absolutely. I'm very close to you in age and transition timeline (+1 year to basically everything you said) and I still dream about it.

If I went back as still trans, I'd have done everything sooner and a bit less frantically. If I could go back as a cis-girl, then that's like a dream come true right there.

But, I'm at peace with where I am. Like you said, we can't actually go back. And we've had some permanent changes we can't exactly undo. I feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be, even if things aren't perfect, and I can actually focus on living life without the whole ""transition"" thing hanging over me.
I do wish I was brave enough to tell my parents when I was a kid because they have always been supportive. I started hormones at 28 and now I'm 29, my mum says I have a certain childlike demeanour from time to time.

I don't really notice it but it's probably me going through the missing childhood xD with the dreaded need to work so I can afford hrt ._.

But my boy self defence mechanism is still very active from the bullying days and I only notice that when I'm on guard and threatened (though by pointless and mundane things :p).
Honestly I wish I just had my current knowledge as a teen. Idk if I'd want to be born female just because my experiences that are important to me would be different. For example my wife is bi and accepts me as male or female, but when we got together she thought she was straight. I feel like if I was born female we probably wouldn't have gotten together in the first place and I'd have a much different life. I love my life I just would like to have started transitioning sooner
I started hrt i think when i was 16 now i‚Äòm almost 18 and i still wish i did it way before that bc i was  already in puberty so yeah that would‚Äòve mad things so much easier when i didn‚Äôt even had to go trough male puberty
When I was fourteen my mom moved me and my brother to Saskatchewan. For those that don't know, it's basically the Texas of Canada.

I wish I'd run away from home before that move. I didn't have much stuff. A backpack of clothing and a box of video games and a handful of books would have been all I'd want to bring with me.

The box I could have hidden away at school and I know a bunch of places both inside the school and outside where I could have slept without being noticed. The local youth center would have given me somewhere to do my homework. The showers at school would have kept me clean and between the cafeteria and shoplifting I could have kept myself fed.

I ended up on the streets four years later anyways after my mom kicked me out. I can't help but think if I'd just run away from home *then*, I'd be doing so much better now. At the very least I wouldn't have spent four years hating myself in the middle of redneck country.
There have been so many mistakes of my life that could be avoided by a redo.  I wish that I could restart with the knowledge I have now just so I could remedy those mistakes and sure redoing it cisfem would be way better!
Lately my escapist fantasy has almost exclusively been starting life over with the knowledge I have now. The things I‚Äôd change, the ways I‚Äôd help and fix my fucked up family, the people I had met that I‚Äôd be able to help, the ways I‚Äôd finally be able to enjoy my childhood, and get back the 21 years of my life I lost to neglect and dysphoria.
If I could srart over with out the hell and torture of my childhood and the 35 years of misery that followed it I would gladly be trans or whatever amyone wanted! To live free of all of that shit and misery I would start over as anything anyone could imagine!
Yea, I definitely wish that I could have realized I wasn't cis sooner. I dont know why but the thought just never entered my head. I feel like early HS would have been way better for me
I think about that *a lot*. Like, so frickin much you have no idea. There will be days where I literally just go through an entire fantasy play by play on what would I do if I were to wake up tomorrow in my 8 year old body in 2012 or something like that. I only started socially transitioning sixth months ago so in school, I‚Äôve only ever presented as my true gender my senior year of high school. There are so many times where I wish I had realized and started transitioning sooner than that.
i‚Äôd love to. even as trans, then i could have got on the NHS waiting list in time lmao
Yes, of course.
I‚Äôd start right from the beginning if it meant I got to be cis, or even just transition before puberty.
Hell, even a couple years earlier would be a big difference, like I transitioned early last year but I almost did in 2019 only to repress it again and I think a lot about how much further along I‚Äôd be if I‚Äôd done it then. Especially since I started at 23, right before turning 24, and starting at like 21/22 would give me a better chance of hip growth (not a big chance but being stuck with super narrow hips forever with zero chance for change sucks)
Yeah, I think im finally getting to that point, too. I can't spend the rest of my life wishing lol
Good point! and yeah, I'm realizing that! Thank you :)
Yeah, you make a great point. It probably would never be early enough, no matter when I started. Id always have wanted more. Sounds like you have a lot of the same issues I do, even though you started way earlier than me, proving to me that that just how it is. I wish you luck with the rest of your transition. :D Thank you for your input!
Yeah, I wish I started years earlier. And yeah, true. Once I finish the rest of my surgeries, itll be like leaving everything behind for a new life. Already feels like that in a way. Thank you! :D
Exactly! 

Yeah, haha. I get it lol. Thank you!
Yeah, thats kind of where im at, too. Being born as a woman would have been great, but the people that are in my life are only here because I was male. So, if I could just change when I started, def would do it. Ty for commenting :)
Good, I'm glad, and yes, good luck on the rest of your journey!"	smv2m3	trans	36	0.95	2022-02-07 17:02:49
My best friend is mad that I use the term straight for myself	I am a trans man and I used to identify as lesbian, we got in a small fight and she said I like men as a insult (yes very mature of us) so I responded with no I‚Äôm straight and she got confused and said I‚Äôm not a actual guy. We‚Äôve been friends for 10 years and I‚Äôve been trans for 3 of those years so I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so hard for her to just accept me.	"Yikes I'm sorry üíú You deserve much better from your so called friend
Sorry some people have a hard time grasping simple things. I hope your friend smartens up, and realizes you‚Äôre a man.
Oh no, you are transing the gay away. The horror...


/s
I genuinely don‚Äôt get why some people are so worried about this.  They liken it to conversion therapy despite us (trans people) being a tiny portion of the population, literally none of us telling people they‚Äôre trans, and gender being entirely unrelated to sexuality.

Some folks act like if they respect trans people they‚Äôre going to be forced to transition.  It‚Äôs insane."	1020lxl	trans	38	0.97	2023-01-03 06:38:05
No way out. Please dont use fake positivity, i need serious opinions.	"this wont be easy to read. Maybe dont do it if youre in a bad place. 
Its been a full year since i fell into this dysphoria whirlwind and i realised that theres absolutely no way out. The more i indulge in this fantasy of transitioning and even remotely blending in, the further i dive into madness. 

This simply cant be physical reality for me. I see a lot of people on here complaining about their looks but None of you all look like me. And im only 19. 
 
please dont see this as me dismissing trans women. im not that kind of person. I would do it if i could. I can think o a few non passing trans women id be ok to look like but im truly grotesque. It stops being the question of ‚Äúnot passing‚Äù or not ‚Äúblending in‚Äù and its about me looking like a fucking freak. I know a lot of trans women that dont pass and are not disgusting. that wouldnt be me. im huge and hairy. 

I cant believe that this is my reality. I desperately want to accept myself as a man because being a woman is impossible. But i cant accept myself as a man and certainly couldnt accept myself as a 6‚Äô4 transsexual. I feel like the few that got lucky enough with the genetics to transition gave a lot of people false hope. I dont want to go through all of this soul crushing changes and sacrifice my whole life to ‚ÄúSlightly alleviate‚Äù dysphoria, which is what some might say. That is clearly an elaborate lie to think like it is curing something. Clearly even transition can be useless. And it makes me crazy to hear that its the only way. transition or die basically

For a year ive been trying to bargain with reality, thinking that it would work. How the hell do i accept this life for myself when i havent even started living? id be better off dead. I must have done some horrible shit in my past life to deserve this.  every day i feel like i lose my entire grasp on what i am. 

I usually search out detransitioners because their experience seems to be closer to mine but they are all bitter and resentful. And they attack trans women because their transitions didnt work, but under the guise of ‚Äúexposing this lie that is being spread‚Äù and trying to convince themselves that being trans is wrong. So clearly, doing that doesnt work. 

I dont want to kms since i believe that it‚Äôs morally wrong but im probably going to try to stay alive until i develop a serious illness and die. I can barely stand most days and its worse every day. What the actual fuck do i do?"	"Ok so I promise this isn‚Äôt fake positivity, but I think this is the dysphoria talking. 

6‚Äô4‚Äù and hairy is not really a barrier to entry on womanhood. Hear me out.

Plenty of women are that tall and taller and are just as beautiful as shorter women.

As far as the hair goes, there are procedures to help with that and I think if you went on E it might thin out some. You don‚Äôt have to shave, you can use a chemical hair remover in the mean time while you wait for laser procedures.

On E you‚Äôll also lose a lot of muscle and thin out. 

I think your dysphoria has convinced you that you‚Äôre disgusting and can never be feminine, but that‚Äôs likely not true.

As far as detransitioners go, my understanding is that they were never trans to begin with, but struggled with self hatred and through a series of misunderstandings about themselves and maybe some bad therapy decided to transition, only to realize their AGAB wasn‚Äôt why they were unhappy. This does not sound like you to me. 

Also, you‚Äôre 19. Technically past puberty but still developing mentally. It‚Äôs going to be a tough time for you in other ways too. 

Try to take a deep breath. 

Worst case scenario it doesn‚Äôt have to be about passing, it‚Äôs about living authentically, but look at [this beautiful woman](https://imgur.com/a/S0psv1T). The left is her before picture. That‚Äôs pretty big and hairy, but after years on E and a nice haircut you‚Äôd never even know. 

Passing is possible, with time, even if you‚Äôre ‚Äúhuge and hairy‚Äù
How could transition be any worse than feeling like this?
I was a 6‚Äô3‚Äù hulking hairy beast, and was convinced I could never transition and be happy due to my size, weight, and Chewbacca ancestry.

Turns out‚Ä¶. I have, and am thriving even though I probably don‚Äôt pass. Hair is solvable. Weight or bulk is malleable in so many ways, should you choose. Height isn‚Äôt, but, cis women are tall too. Voice is too.

I wish I had gone for it at 19 rather than waiting for it to be unbearable at 31. I promise you that transition is totally worth it. It‚Äôs not been an easy journey but I‚Äôm at peace internally after decades of struggling. As trite as it probably sounds to you right now, my life truly is awesome now and has never been better and I‚Äôve never been happier, and it is entirely due to choosing to pursue transition.

I cannot emphasize enough how helpful a therapist will be, someone who is there to listen to you and help you process this. 

Lastly, remember you‚Äôre at the start of this journey, not approaching the end. It will take time, and many many many blunders along the way. And that‚Äôs ok! Be kind to yourself and allow yourself the room to try things and fail and learn and improve. You need to crawl before you can walk, then run, and only then sprint. Transition may also not be possible or viable for you at the present time, and that‚Äôs ok too! There is no age limit on transitioning just like there isn‚Äôt any singular mold that trans people have to fit in. It‚Äôs your journey and you‚Äôre in control.
Big and hairy. Well. Hairy is optional. Lazer hair removal ain't cheap but it's an option.

As far as big? My mom was 6'3"" and overweight to obese most of her life. Be a big tall queen. Shop at big tall Sally's. (actually ny&c has the best tall size women's pants, they look professional but they're comfy too!)

I'm 6'1"". Trans too, but in a different direction. But more importantly here. Multiply disabled. The hot beautiful trans people I see. They're never in wheelchairs. They don't use canes except maybe as a fashion prop. They aren't visibly disfigured. They never have the fatigue and pain to not even be able to contemplate makeup. Showering is hard enough already. And fashion? It's gotta be comfortable and easy to put on and take off. So I get where you're coming from.

I don't see myself in other trans people. I'm not gonna pass as anything but weird. At this point, I've accepted that. Being conventionally attractive is not an option. But I found someone who finds me attractive. One person. And that's really all I need. I've got a partner who loves and cares for me. And I've got friends who bring me joy. So at this point? Fuck being attractive. This is just my experience but being attractive before transition and disability both, it wasn't all it's cracked up to be. I was just always afraid of getting sexually assaulted. Sure people were more polite to me, nice and smiley, but clear enough that was all fake. At least now no one will pretend to like me just cause of attractiveness. My friends and my partner like me for me. Nothing else.

I can't tell you how to feel. I can only tell you how I feel, what I've experienced, and way at the top a few maybe suggestions to make it easier. But it's possible to accept. Being ugly doesn't make you bad or less worthy of a person. It's just a state of being. I'm ugly and I'm good with it. I deserve to live and be treated with dignity compassion and respect because I'm a human person. No other conditions, no exceptions. My worth is based on my living breathing existence and cannot be taken away. Not by disability. Not by ugliness. Not by anything but death.
I don‚Äôt think transitioning and dying are the only options, but I also think you need to look at transitioning as more then just the singuar story you see in the media. That is what makes the most sense for a lot of trans folks, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the only option. I think questioning beautistandards is also really important. I don‚Äôt really know the imperial system, but I think you‚Äôre the same hight as nikkie de jager/nikkietutorials. She is I think the most famous trans woman in my country and yeah people make comments about that she‚Äôs really tall, but that‚Äôs all the comments are. She‚Äôs not a freak. She‚Äôs beautiful, and really tall which makes things look funny sometimes when she towers over people. I don‚Äôt know what you look like, but you also don‚Äôt need to be a pretty woman to be a woman. 

Maybe rather then look at the big picture of men vs woman, try looking at small things. What length do you want your hair to be? Do you like paining your nails? Do you like jewelry? Changes that are not soulcrushing, that don‚Äôt require you to change your entire life, but might still alleviate some dysphoria
Hey I get it.  Dysphoria is a bitch, really.  I may not be MtF but I am trans.  And I know how hard it is to wake up see yourself and feel absolutely disgusted with the body you're in.  To feel like nothing is going to help.  To feel hopeless.  But you have to remind yourself that you are more than your body.  You are more than what people perceive you as.  You are more.  I'm not trying to use fake positivity in the slightest because I know you don't want that.  I just want to tell you that even if you don't Medically transition you are still a wonderful woman.
Hmm.  Maybe think about transition as less of a binary, singular decision, and think of it more as a series of decisions, each with their own causes and effects.  Try thinking of your body, the things you can change, and the things you want to change.  Clothing and hair are easy changes, sure, but how exactly do you want to change them?  You could incorporate more pastels and still wear more masculine styles, or you could stick with neutral colors and wear masculine and feminine styles.  You could go on a low dosage of E and see how you like it in tandem with other changes, or you could go on a huge dosage of E and Spiro and change literally nothing else.

A lot of your ""I'll look like a freak"" talk sounds like just dysphoria, and a LOT of social conditioning that reads like a strong hatred of nonbinary people.  Which is fair, social conditioning DOES formulate everything in a very binary set of rules, which includes the only ways to look attractive are as a binary man or a binary woman.  Idk where you'll go in life, but I just wanna let you know that my friends (and myself, once I finally get back on hrt) all look like ""freaks"", and I love them all very dearly.
One of the most fem looking people I know is 6-4, height isn't an issue to giving off girl energy
Italian women often have very dark and prevalent body hair. You aren‚Äôt less of a woman for having body hair and laser hair removal does exist which can alleviate it in the areas you want it gone the most
Sometime we just gotta accept being big queer ""freaks.""   I am with you in the ""transition is hopeless"" boat.  It's really difficult to accept ourselves, all transness aside.  Throw in being trans and its like fucked up hard.  I have shared a lot of the same thoughts and feelings that you seem to have.  I'm almost 30 now and still working on myself and there's always more to work on and accept.   It's been a really long and hard road accepting myself, but I can't even begin to express in words how beautiful all the experiences and lessons I've had and learned along the way are.  I've never loved myself like I do now.  Depression, dysphoria, it never goes away.  We learn how to cope and handle our emotions, and put our feelings and energy to good use.  I know it's hard, but negative self talk is a thing that we can work though.  There's a lot of things you can learn about psychology and therapy that will give you hope and tools to use to make your experience one worth while.  I keep finding myself telling this to people here, because it is so valid for trans folks to hear; courage is the one of the most beautiful things of yourself you can show this world.  I don't know you, but I believe you can find the courage and strength to endure what you are experiencing and learn how to love and embrace the mind and body that you have. ‚ù§
Sounds like something you should see a therapist about, but to me, it just seems like you‚Äôre letting dysphoria overtake your mind. Transition, if it‚Äôs needed, alleviates dysphoria. That‚Äôs why people do it. 

Other body image issues need to be addressed separately, though. Transition won‚Äôt fix someone thinking they‚Äôre fat or ugly, etc. unless it specifically ties into their dysphoria.
I'm going to be as blunt as I know how. Sorry if it's too much, but I want you to see that I am speaking the unadulterated truth.

I know this is hard to see from your perspective, but what you're seeing as fake positivity IS serious opinions. Speaking as a trans person who's dealt with suicidal ideology since I was a child, it is absolutely the truth that most people are shocked by what hormones can do for their body. People that felt exactly like how you do now. People like myself. 

Nobody's trying to hoodwink you on this. We went  through what you did, and we came out the other side and realized it was worth it. You don't have to trust that right away.  But it's a comparatively small thing to just try. Get on HRT. Give it a month. Hell, give it a week. 

As far detransitioners - they're a miniscule portion of the community. That's verified data from reliable sources. And remember that those communities have an agenda. They want you to not transition. To be blunt: they want you to feel like a freak. Many of them want to drive you to depression and suicide. Would you trust a flat earther to tell you the truth about physics? Most of them never truly transitioned - they're cis people posing as detransitioners to push their agenda, because they know it makes them seem more credible.
I probably wont get to respond to all of you, but im very thankful for all messages .
Okay so first of all, I absolutely get it, I do, trust me even a year in I have bouts of feeling like absolute garbage and like I'll never look like a woman

But second? I know cis women who are taller, and cis women who are probably hairier. I definitely know trans women who are taller and used to be hairier. I used to be hairy as fuck. Just the hormones alone is enough to fix the hair for most, and lasers are still a thing, the hair will be okay. I do not think the height is an issue, personally, there's nothing that says women can't be tall except misogynists and transphobes, and quite a lot of people find it attractive. If you're a bit on the muscly side and don't like that? You can change it. And if you don't want to change it, it's still something that can be attractive for both cis and trans women. If you're fat? You can change that if you don't like it, like I did. But also? One of my girlfriends is 300lbs, and she is goddamn beautiful, and there are definitely people who would think the same of you regardless of weight. And the face, one of my biggest issues, the thing that caused me the most self-harm, I actually think is rather okay now, I can be moderately comfortable. I still have issues with my chest and hips but I am 1 year on, there's so much growing left to do, and I started at 23 years old

I promise you, sweetheart, no matter how absolutely crippling the dysphoria gets, it is wrong. I can't function like a normal adult because of it and my ADHD, but I'm alright. And you will be, too
Hey it's okay to be tall and hairy, but if you would be willing, estrogen may help with hair after a while, and lazer hair removal too. And I know plenty of people who love tall and big gals. In a sort of way I know how you feel, I'm trying to transition from ftm, and I always have doubts about myself and if I'll ever pass. If you need to talk tho, message me.
Clearly heartfelt message. Thank you üôèidk if i agree about the tall thing. its obviously different for a cisgender woman to be that tall. different skeletal structure etc but i see the point of the dysphoria talking. 
No offense but im not a fan of the , i transitioned but ‚Äúive always been the other gender‚Äù thing. I just dont like to think like that lol. Gender comes last to me but its the psysical aspect that causes the problems. I dont see my soul as being gendered. 
also, fair point about the detrans people. a lot of them either had unresolved mental issues or confused it for something else. after a long time in therapy and figuring stuff out ive realised that im not traumatized. 

but damn that transformation is crazy.
Well there are many people who did that and were just as bad after. maybe worse
Hugs bro! (If you want them). Being disabled is a bitch. I'm sure doubly so if it's visible to other people. I'm so glad you found a partner! Also, fuck beauty standards. Also also, I second that people are people and nothing anyone else can do can take that way from us!
thank u for the message. im afraid to crossdress because of my body. Also, nikki went on blockers at like 12 so its all very different. as to what i look like... I am v tall and w a antony quinn esque face
I‚Äôd also like to add that you aren‚Äôt necessarily past puberty at 19. There are tons of cases where puberty can still be a thing until roundabout 24 or so. Just a thought. I love you and wish you well, you‚Äôre valid regardless of what you choose, and I‚Äôm genuinely saying that, not just being falsely positive.
This is kind of random but I was also really frustrated with gender and never realized how other people didn't see how dumb it all was. Until I realized I fit best into a nonbinary gender (as our society sees it). That might not be right for you but I wanted to plant the seed in case it was.

I also wanted to say no one ""deserves"" what happens to them in life we are born is a situation we deal with and/or enjoy many situations throughout our life and then at some point we die. Blaming yourself for the situation your in can be very toxic if you don't actually have any control over it (talking from experience). Instead I find it more useful to start thinking about what is under my control and how I can move towards the situations I'd prefer. I may not like where I am right now but I can say certainly that I've managed to claw my way back from coming out to my mom and being in a really dark place.

I believe in you pal! 

Also, sorry if I didn't word this very well but I've been somewhere similar to where you are and I made it through. I can't promise you everything will magically get better but I can say that there's a chance that it will get better. If you ever need to vent or have questions feel free to dm us. Hugs! (If you want them)
Probably a lot less than you think, detransition is incredibly rare and most of that small percentage is because of social pressure. Many of them retransition if they achieve a more stable and supportive social environment.
Few end up worse, unless you count the unfortunate few born in horribly reactionary countries, religions or families. Detransitioners represent a tiny minority within an already small group.

Balance that against the many, many trans people who took that first step and never went back. Never want to go back.

I understand the pressure to ""pass"". It was all I wanted when I started; for safety, for security, for validation. I told people as much without hesitation... but transition itself has a way of taking the edges off.

It wasn't really about ""passing"", upon reflection. I wanted to be desirable. I wanted to be beautiful. I was terrified that all the things I saw in the mirror and hated were terrible, ugly things, that stood out like a sore thumb to others the way they did for me. But that was the dysphoria warping my perceptions - other people don't feel that when they see me.

 Transition treats the dysphoria in a way better than any pill or therapist. It made me feel better about myself, accept myself more. It helped me see that what I was feeling was the pressure of impossible beauty standards, something all women deal with, cis and trans alike. In my community there are cis women of all shapes and sizes, some look like a shaved gorilla with bolted on tits but they still get gendered correctly. Sure enough, after enough HRT, I got gendered correctly too.

There is hope. But you have to _fight_ for your happiness. You have to take the first step yourself. If it doesn't work out, then at least you tried, and what have you lost? You're literally talking about punching your own ticket, here.
Only three people (if I remember correctly) in a study of over three *thousand* permanently detransitioned. And less than 1% even detransitioned temporarily. 

Another study, which is a meta-analysis showed that the vast majority of studies show an increase in positive feelings and emotions and I believe four or five showed null findings, meaning there was no change. None‚Äînot a single one‚Äîshowed people being in a worse emotional state after transitioning.

I‚Äôll look for the citations for these and post them if I find them again. If someone already knows, feel free to add them.
Would it help to think about trying different clothes in terms of other things then how they look? Like trying a skirt to see if you find it comfortable to wear around the house? If you like how it feels? Maybe don‚Äôt even look in a mirror to see if you think it looks good on you, just focus on if you like wearing it? (Or if skirts aren‚Äôt your thing something else that feels feminine to you) Ofcourse it‚Äôs nice if you think you look good in something, but that‚Äôs not the only reason to wear/try something
I dont wanna cause conflict or anything but ive sometimes people are lying to themselves to keep up the illusion. Ive seen people saying ‚Äútransitioning changed my life!‚Äù but they are still suicidal in real life and not because of social rejection. Thats usually a very popular talking point but a lot of the time its just dysphoria. And detransitioners are not rare. that was like a punch in the face when i realised
I've seen surveys that suggest it's a couple percent of people that start transitioning who detransition, if that many. Most of the hype you'll see in the news or on YouTube is cherry-picked data to make it look way more common for people to regret transition than it actually is, because they want to argue for more gatekeeping and less access to care. 

I've transitioned and has it made my life perfect? No. But has it greatly improved my life even though I don't ""pass""? Yes absolutely. I can touch my skin without hating it, I feel at home in my body when I don't have to see it, I can actually feel emotions besides extremes of joy or depression, it feels like I am actually living my life instead of just being stuck on a ride even though in many ways nothing substantial has changed. My skin feels (maybe looks?) different and I have very small boobs. I still have facial hair, still have a nearly identical body shape overall. There's a lot more to it than just those effects though.
People can just have depression that isn‚Äôt caused by being trans. Also, you have no way of knowing if their life has or hasn‚Äôt improved. It very well could be the fact that transitioning really has improved their life and without transitioning they would be dead rather than depressed.
Then it just seems to me like you have the idea set in your head and don‚Äôt really want to hear what research has shown if you really think like this.

Most trans people have issues that extend beyond dysphoria and those need to be addressed too, not just ignored."	rxledi	trans	33	1.0	2022-01-06 18:30:51
My wife left me	"First I want to say I am not mad at her, and totally get it. I am not looking to pile on with her. But I just need to post something right now since I am so sad. 

We have been together 11 years and I came out to her almost exactly a year ago. She is doing her best to be supportive but it's been eating her and I can tell, which in turn eats at me. I really thought we could survive this but I was wrong. 

I will always love her, wish I could just be happy with the body I was given. Life is unfair. 

I have a lot of time left on this planet and I have two kids who I adore, so no one worry, I am not going anywhere. 

But just needed some love, today is not my day."	"Im so sorry :(...  life is unfair but we gotta take it one day at a time
know your not alone and your are loved <3
No way around it, it sucks and it's gonna be hard, but you gotta live your truth. I'm recently separated following some long overdue introspection on my own sexuality (also 2 kids, silver lining there) so I feel ya. Stay strong, try to focus on where you want to be, but it's ok to feel where you are now, even if it sucks.
I am most likely moving this same direction myself, and it does make you very sad to think about. I have been married almost 16 years myself, but things have definitely changed since I told my wife two years ago. We have three kids together, also. I will never blame her either way though, as she is just a straight woman, and it wasn't her fault. Please just keep your head up, and I will try to do the same for you. Take great care, and I really wish you well!üôÇ
I'm sorry to hear that.  I am in the early stages of the same situation and it's incredibly difficult. I think living as your true self is incredibly important though.
Hugs, stranger. <3
Thank you. I really appreciate it.
Thanks, really trying to look to the future.
Thanks, and ya. I saw the change as well. Still hope yours ends up better, but of course, not anyone's fault. Life is just tricky sometimes.
Thank you. Ya, I agree, but still a bad day

mom got mad about my painted nails :(	just kinda bummed, bc if she‚Äôs mad about that, she is not gonna like future convos‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ had to come back to college due to an emergency and so left them painted, and she pretty much flipped out when she saw them. just feel unbelievably crappy about it	"I'm sorry. It sucks that something as harmless as painting your nails is something they make us feel bad about.
Well she ain't gonna like my part of the world. It's a trend for anyone! 

I hope she sees reason one day
Sorry to hear about this. Try not to take it personally, and know that your mother is likely speaking from a place of ignorance (and hopefully not hate).

In highschool my Mom got upset at me for letting one of my friends paint my nails black, because apparently she had been told that it was ""offensive to trans people""??

I am not sure where she got this at all, but the shame I felt for not understanding why I felt good with painted nails combined with the shame of potentially offending/appropriating a group of people without even knowing it... Shit, girl, it's no wonder it took me until the age of 33 for my egg to crack.

Best advice is to find the people that hear and see you for how you wish to be seen, and focus on what they have to say about you. Because I'm sure in contrast to the discomfort and likely abusive behaviours you're experiencing from your family that your friends will have greater sympathy and acceptance for you as the beautiful individual that you are.
So my mom called my nails disgusting BUT they were magnetic polish so super cool and she eventually caved and said it was cool nail polish. I had also just bought her food and taken her to run errands though so I probably just bought half that approval.
as hagrid would say‚Ä¶ ‚Äúyou got a big storm coming‚Äù
fingers crossed lol
thanks!!! means a lot. up north is definitely more accepting and great, just didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was back home until i got back :) good ole rosy retrospection
lmaooo my color was definitely not that good bc i still had to have it to pass for my internship (college is up north and a lot more liberal than the south) but i paid $$$ for these nails i‚Äôm not taking them off!!! what color did u get?
You could say you like Kpop and point out that most Kpop men use nail polish. Jpop and rock too. 
Why didn't I think of this before. 
I mean there's plenty of cis het male celebs rocking paint on their nails. 

I grew up with it being normal for men to have Dark but stil nailpolish. (Punk/goth/metal vibes)

If you need to be super covert maybe read up on it and show her?
Yah you can‚Äôt let that money go to waste! Mine was Dream within a Dream by Cirque Colors. It‚Äôs currently my favorite and I highly recommend
i hit her with the ‚Äúwell glad i‚Äôm not wearing it for you then‚Äù but it just hurts that she was so upset about it :(
omg that‚Äôs cute af def gonna need that next time!!!
Yes. She should apologize"	s9zx13	trans	32	0.97	2022-01-22 10:45:53
My friend keeps saying I‚Äôm not legally trans	I have a close friend who I‚Äôve known for almost three years now, and he‚Äôs starting to go against me being trans. I‚Äôm FtM and so far I‚Äôve only cut my hair and changed my pronouns/name, and my friend is telling me I‚Äôm not trans. He says I can‚Äôt be a ‚Äòproper‚Äô male until I get surgery. I keep telling him he‚Äôs wrong, but he doesn‚Äôt listen. I try to explain to him that I AM trans, but he keeps ignoring me and saying he‚Äôs right and that I‚Äôm getting mad over nothing. He doesn‚Äôt use my pronouns or preferred name, even when I ask him to. He says ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt call you that because you haven‚Äôt legally changed your name.‚Äù Today during school he told me ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a boy, you‚Äôre a girl. You aren‚Äôt legally trans, and I‚Äôm right.‚Äù A minute later the recess bell went and I hid and cried. I really need advice on what to say to him, because it‚Äôs one of the main reasons I have such bad dysphoria and self esteem. Please help me out here.	"fuck that, cut him out of your life. seriously, legality means Nothing & i can promise you when you do change your name (if you choose to do so) legally, he will 100% Not start calling you by it. he sounds like a shit person who's enjoying your misery and you just don't need to deal with that man
Sounds not like a friend, sorry.
That's not a friend. I'd just stop talking to him. There's no ""legal way"" to be trans... he's just being an jerk.
He's not a real friend. People who know the process of being trans know transitioning can take forever, and isnt even necessary. All he's doing is promoting toxic transmed talking points. If he keeps it up, just leave him. If he harasses you more, report it. Your safety and happiness as a trans person means more than a bigot's fun and games toying with you like this.
This sounds like classical emotional bullying behaviour where he is getting enjoyment out of arguing with you and (in his brain) ""winning"".  The more you argue back, and the more upset it makes you, the more powerful he will feel. Unfortunately the only way to stop it is to stop talking to him about the topic or stop talking to him at all. You can't ""win"" the argument.
Someone who I knew before talked to me in similar way he said as long as u don‚Äôt have breast or nt having surgery yet U r considered a gay femboy? 
I blocked him lol
As people have said before, there are two points:  
1. He's bastards  
2. He's not a friend

And I totally agree with that
Firstly, get that transphobic asshole out of your life, it won't do you any good to keep them around.

Secondly, being trans has nothing to de with legality, its about your gender preference, and you don't need to do anything to your body to be trans, that's not how it works.
To make matters worse, he thinks non binary people are pointless. He says ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they just be what they were at birth, it‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù I explained it‚Äôs how they feel about themselves and that they are more comfortable without being called male or female. He then says ‚ÄúWait so they cut off their parts? Haha idiots why can‚Äôt they keep what they‚Äôve got and get over it?‚Äù I even tell him to research stuff, like transgender people to understand me better, but he‚Äôs ‚Äúbusy‚Äù stuffing his fat mouth with the entire fucking MacDonalds menu and staring at his Xbox for 2 days straight. I blocked him on discord, now I‚Äôm gonna make sure he doesn‚Äôt talk to me at all. I can‚Äôt stand him any longer.
Sadly he is not you friend he‚Äôs a freakin moron
Don‚Äôt listen to him, you are totally valid and you‚Äôre a beautiful man, a real man
He is either stupid or jealous or both 
Pls don‚Äôt mind him
And if it‚Äôs really really your friend try to talk to him and explain how ya feel to him
But seems like he doesn‚Äôt listen to you man :(
You won't be happy until this asshole is totally out of your life. Don't half ass it, he is not your friend even if he used to be. You don't have to take this
You are trans, you are male, your chosen name is real as hell, and you're doing your best.

This person is intentionally hurting you by refusing to use words you want him to. He is not right, and you can quote me, a 33 year old trans, at him.

You deserve better friends.
Fuck that guy, he's an asshole and doesn't respect you or trans people in general.
That's not a friend at all, anyone that stands for transmed is the only and right thing is a cunt, and is not a piece of paper from the government that dictates your rights to be called the way you want.  
Focus on yourself, you must be an amazing person and don't need that kind of people in your life
If they can‚Äôt respect your choices and be supportive of you you are no longer sharing equal respect for each other it‚Äôs become a one sided relationship and you do not need that extra stress in your life if they can‚Äôt respect / support you by something as simple as using your preferred  name and pronouns you need to walk away and you are young good chance they won‚Äôt be there when you really need them in a few years anyway and it‚Äôs not your loss it‚Äôs theirs
Get him out of your life, you deserve love and support not hate and ignorance
Don‚Äôt listen to him hun! You wanna be a girl? You can be a girl! You wanna be a guy? You can be a guy! You can be whatever the fuck you want! Don‚Äôt listen to that friend, sorry but he‚Äôs an absolute asshole"	jx0vk8	trans	31	0.97	2020-11-19 11:11:37
need to ask.	"I'm on pc, i normally use my phone but its broken, so, I'm sorry for spelling errors.

I'm dating this bi girl (she's cis) and I'm mtf. she uses he/him pronouns when she talks about me. i told her how much it hurts, but she still uses those pronouns. A week ago i asked if she will call me a girl when I  transition, she said she will. so, would you guys say she's transphobic?

Edit: it's an online relationship, she lives in germany, and I live in the U.S.

edit 2: some of you might see this as a win... but my partner and I are not an item anymore... i have abandonment issues and everytime when she looked at my message and when she didn't text back i use to be really sad and my anxiety made me think she was gonna break up with me so i told her about it... but it did not help so i said we should take a break until she comes to America. then she got mad/upset/hurt and told me to delete pics of her i didn't have. i told her that the relationship is just put on hold, then she said she didn't care about the relationship she just want the pics delete i told her that i don't have the pics then she told me not to text her again. i told her please don't let it end like this, and that i still love her. but she said i only used her to fill a hole in my heart and that i just wanted her to send me nudes of her. (i did ask her from time to time, but i wasn't using her, and if anything she showed me what it's like to love again). she then blocked me, i went to visit my mother then i checked to see if she still has me blocked, and she doesn't. i hope you enjoyed my update."	"She‚Äôs being mean, I‚Äôd keep an eye out for any other rude behavior
I feel like if she loved you shed at least try to not hurt you yk?
Are you out to other people besides her? Maybe she just doesn‚Äôt want to out you to people who don‚Äôt know
You don‚Äôt need to put up with that shit!
Yeah, if she keeps misgendering you when you correct her and she doesn't even try to use your correct pronouns, she's being very ignorant, and kinda transphobic. Also why would she wait to call you a girl till you transition. You are a girl and she can call you a girl now, because you already are a girl.
Save yourself the pain and leave girl. I just read that it‚Äôs an online relationship and it takes zero effort too type she instead of him tf üôÑ
Not phobic but I'd say she speaks on what she sees so its hard to see you otherwise. Because you've chosen this identity for yourself, the switch isn't made for others that easily or quickly. Many don't acknowledge the change until a change is seen BUT if you keep asking her to respect your pronouns and she doesn't then that's a problem.
Guatemala
not acceptable at all. regardless of whether you look like a girl right now (as you talked about in other comments) she, as your partner, should be making the effort regardless. it's simply not good enough that she won't call you by your pronouns.
she can get rude at times. but only at times.
I'm pretty sure she loves me. I just don't understand why she is using male pronouns with me. She even called me a man the other day.
it's an online relationship and I'm out to everyone online. I had to go back in the closest because I'm scared that my brother will start a fight with her when she uses male pronouns when she moves to the U.S.
do you have any tips to make her stop calling me he/him?
I don't know, maybe she doesn't see me as a girl until i transition?
if i do leave her it won't be easy for me.
I talked to her about it a few times, but it doesn't seem like she'll call me she/her until i transition or maybe she'll never call me she/her. i really don't know yet.
>Guatemala

what?
sadly she isn't my partner anymore.
That sounds like she isn‚Äôt a nice person if this is a pattern of behavior. You don‚Äôt need to be in a relationship if it doesn‚Äôt make you happy. Not being in a relationship is better than a bad one
It's a simple answer, she sees you as a man right now. Not saying it cannot change. But if you talk about it with her and she still refuses to change then- üòê
Then, I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs transphobic, which I‚Äôm sorry to say, and I know you probably don‚Äôt like to hear. Luckily, it seems like she‚Äôs open to change.
I think I would tell her you are transitioning, and part of that is that non-bigots who you keep in your life use your chosen pronouns. Transition looks different for everyone, you have started transition and are hiding aspects but you are a woman and deserve to be talked to like one. 

Not everybody does all the ‚Äòsteps‚Äô of transition, even if you haven‚Äôt begun any physical work on it you are transitioning just by knowing you‚Äôre a woman and sharing with people you trust
Honestly if you‚Äôve told her it hurts and you don‚Äôt want her to do it and she STILL does it, That‚Äôs a deal breaker for me. I want to be fully seen and respected in a relationship and pronouns are the most basic way to do that. So if someone can‚Äôt respect that then I don‚Äôt wanna even talk to them let alone be in a relationship with them.
Transition starts the moment you identify as a woman. End of. If they don't respect your identity, they don't respect you.
Well if she doesn't see you as a woman now, she's completely blind and you should dump her.
Aww, I know. But she literally does not care enough about you for something as simple as pronouns even when you‚Äôve told her how much it hurt you. It‚Äôs your decision at the end of the day but you don‚Äôt deserve someone like that. You know what‚Äôs best for you at the end of the day just know you deserve everything in life.
Guatemala
i wouldn't call it bad. she does make me happy when she isn't calling me he/him or a man
her and i broke up.
Her and I have been dating for almost a year, i really don't want to break up with her.
I'm gonna do every step of transitioning. but i don't think she'll call me a girl until i look like one.
well, she does help me with my depression when she's not calling me he/him. Plus i do love her when she's not calling me he/him
i mean, she does make me happy other than calling me he/him and a man
like the country?
You deserve someone who will respect you, which she clearly isn't doing
Sometimes change doesn't need to be immediate. Communicate clearly how much it's important for you that she uses the right pronouns. Correct her when she does a mistake. That's personally how I got all my older friends to call me correctly
Well, you‚Äôre a woman so you look like a woman. Some women don‚Äôt look like how people expects a woman to look like. 

Even if you plan to one day appear as more of what people expect a woman to look like; you are still a woman today. She needs to know this
You do what feels right for you. I‚Äôm just saying that with the info you gave it‚Äôs a major red flag and sounds like you‚Äôre making excuses for her. Either way I hope you work something out xx
Well, Its your choice ofc. I hope she stops misgendering you.
Guatemala
i did try a couple of times, but it didn't work. But I'll try again.
maybe i am. if her and i don't work out i'll be done with love. maybe that's why i am making excuses for her? and thank you
her and i broke up, so, it'll be hard to do that.
Don't give up. It can be a long process but it will be worth it
thank you for your help
well i can't correct her anymore, we broke up and she told me not to talk to her then blocked me, then she unblocked me but i don't think she'll text me again
I'm sorry. I know loosing someone good or bad always hurts. But it will be good in the end. Be there for yourself you are loveable üíï
thank you, don't worry, i'll be alright."	swk22j	trans	30	0.91	2022-02-19 21:12:30
So I‚Äôm in love, with a lovely trans woman.	She‚Äôs something else, she‚Äôs super lovely, super attractive and just seemingly a good person. I‚Äôve never been with someone that is trans not because of some shitty phobia but because there‚Äôs nobody that I‚Äôve met in my city that is trans. I love her but whenever I talk to her or about her,  it makes me sad, it makes me said because her rights can just be taken away from the shitty president we have. How do you tel someone you love them without driving yourself mad?	"Treat her like a normal girl and ask her out.

Trans people(no bottom surgery) usually don't want to make the first move unless they're certain the other person is into trans people, especially if you're good friends, she probably wouldn't want to risk scaring you off by asking you out.

If she told you that she's trans, especially if she passes enough that you wouldn't otherwise know, she's probably trying to tell you  ""If you want a relationship with me, you need to know this. I'm going to leave it to you to make the first move if you still want to."" I can't imagine wanting to tell someone I'm trans if they accept me as my chosen gender, unless I expect there's a possibility what's between my legs will come up.

Unfortunately, it can be hard to date as a transgender person even if you pass well. The sad truth is that most people just aren't into transgender people, so, if she passes perfectly and is letting you know that she's trans, it's probably because you're already flirting and she wants to know if you're going to keep flirting now that you know.

She is a girl, though. Normal relationship rules apply. Obviously, try to read the room, but usually it's not the best idea to outright say you love someone before... developing history. Ask her out.

If you're already in a relationship with her..... Finding out how to tell her you love her is a very personal journey. If you think it's been long enough that it's not gonna be weird... just do it.
You know what feels good?  Punching back at the President by knocking on doors to elect people who won't lick his boots.  There's still time.  https://thelastweekend.org/

Struggles	"Hi there lovely trans community,

I came out as trans to my friends and my mum. I still need to fill in my brother and I've been asked to not tell my grandpa cause he would never understand that and unnecessarily enrage over it .  My brother probably would have his problems with it too but would be willing to accept it and get more used to it . My mum is a real darling . She informed herself directly and got really mad about that transgenderism is still listed as a mental illness. 

I am knowing that I am trans since I was a kid but my social anxiety got the better of me and I never was able to talk about it . Up until recently . I am almost 32 mtf and I still have a lot of struggles to go through to even get my hands on the hormones ( finding a psychologist who supports you and gives you the prescription for the endocrinologist and with that finding someone in that profession that does not give you more obstacles than needed)  and that's honestly saddening even though I can understand the reasons why . 

My biggest struggle though is that thought in my head that it is already to late for changes. Ok a lovely friend told me I would have an androgynous body and therefore would have better chances for a good change. My body disphoria is not just caused by that thing down there but very much caused by the sound of my own voice.

I am reading that even with hormones and a surgery for the vocal chords the feminization of the voice would be very subtle .
Which brings me to the question , can I forget about sounding female at all ? Will I always sound like either a male or something that's stuck between it ? I'm sorry for those depressive thoughts but I'm so scared and sad about it 

Another thing im scared of is that they sometimes seem to force you to live a life as the wanted gender . Including going to the specific toilet. As a girl stuck in a guys body I am scared of being called a pervert for doing so especially without a certain development in the chest area and that betraying voice . 

With love, 

Aya"	"[deleted]
Thank you for your kind words Stella . I'm actually more worried about the disphoria trigger that it is than the opinion of others about me. 
I did worry about loved ones opinion which kept me from outing but now I am outed and everything feels much easier but still rough and hard now .
I don't need an ultrafemme voice just femme is good enough. Just enough so my vocal disphoria isn't triggered anymore and I would already be much happier . Which would basically just be to pass as a woman in a daily life just by your voice . If some idiots mean to say shit I probably won't give a fuck but when it's more a regular thing or the very first experience in that matter it certainly does .

The part that worries me about vocal training is when you sneeze or cough that it falls back to the old voice and kinda triggers vocal disphoria again or irritates those around you and that causes disphoria.

Again thank you for your kind words <3"	mmokd9	trans	29	0.88	2021-04-08 10:08:32
I am 22 (amab) I think I‚Äôm trans, and I‚Äôm terrified.	"I think I‚Äôm trans. I know me saying ‚ÄúI think‚Äù can be viewed as a little worrisome, but I genuinely think I‚Äôve been pushing these feelings down for so long that I can‚Äôt think straight about the whole idea. I don‚Äôt know where to start so I‚Äôll apologize in advance in case it seems like I‚Äôm jumping around, or just rambling. 

Childhood:
I‚Äôve always know I liked men (or masculine looking people) since I can remember, but there‚Äôs one specific memory that I can‚Äôt shake. When I was eight years old, I found out that Santa Claus wasn‚Äôt real. I woke up that Christmas morning to find there weren‚Äôt any presents under our tree. I was alarmed and ran to my moms room where I found her asleep. I woke her up and frantically told her that Santa missed our house. She, albeit still half asleep, told me that Santa wasn‚Äôt real and that the presents were in her bedroom closet. I started bawling and ran down the hall to my room, climbed up on my top bunk and just wailed for a few hours. I was devastated. Not only, because Santa wasn‚Äôt real, but because of what I had asked him for. I asked to be a girl for a day. I didn‚Äôt even know the word for gay or trans and I asked to be a girl for a day. I felt wrong for liking boys, and I also really had always been drawn to feminine things as a child. I wanted to see if being a girl felt better for me, and now looking back I think this may be a key/core memory that I‚Äôve blocked out. After I sit and think more on that that morning, I remember laying in bed some nights thinking at length what it would be like to be a girl (or a woman at least) and I would picture a blonde woman with very long hair and a rather well endowed chest. I remember how exciting it was to think about being able to go out and buy dresses, purses, and heels. I don‚Äôt know what to make of this, and I‚Äôm scared I can‚Äôt make sense of it, because of what it could mean about me. 

Teenage Years:

I hadn‚Äôt had a thought like what I described above, since then, in a while. Not until I was in my freshman year of high school and caught an episode of RPDR (season 4) playing on logo as I flipped through channels. I was completely enthralled in this show for the same reasons people still are, but I‚Äôm now thinking that my particular interest in it was for a different reason. There was the feeling, something not completely describable yet something I understood without needing to think too hard about. I pushed that feeling down, and kept on with my day. 
Skipping forward to my junior year of HS, I decided that I was going to do drag. Not only was I going to do drag, but I was going to make my debut at Houston Pride 2016. I was all about my makeup and hair and corsets (as well as some Saran Wrap and Duct Tape) and SHOOOOES. -So it all comes together for the day of, I‚Äôve stoned my outfit, added glitter to some cheap Payless heels, sewed 4 giant curly wigs together, and styled them HIGH. The day of was fine, I didn‚Äôt feel anything (other than angry because I ended up shaving my brows off. The hotel room was hot and the glue wouldn‚Äôt stay, aaand I don‚Äôt produce a shotty look) of that *particular* feeling, until I started walking down the street towards the actual festival center/part of pride. It was a knot in my stomach. This felt too good, made me too happy, and I scared myself by just how much I was enjoying it. I felt pride when I stood on top of a trash can to gain attention for a poor woman desperately trying to hand out flyers regarding lgbtqia+ domestic violence. It was me. I wasn‚Äôt anxious, I wasn‚Äôt scared of people, I was filled with the spirit of womanhood and it felt good. It felt like me. 


Present Day: 
The thoughts and that feeling- that I‚Äôm trans, and a woman, come more frequently, but always as a question. Am I trans? I feel like a fraud for even feeling to need to ask myself. People I see and hear talking about their experiences have always known. So then I‚Äôm obviously not trans right, because I need to ask and think about it, BUT I keep thinking about it. The thoughts and questions aren‚Äôt a daily thing, but when they do hit me, they-     h i t  me. Also, as of late my life has been spiraling. I‚Äôve been suffering through some drinking problems (trying to be sober now) and marijuana dependency. Basically anything to make me not have to think. I‚Äôm mad all the time. I‚Äôm depressed, and just feel at best lost. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm reaching for an excuse to explain my own short comings or just actually suffering not living as who I should be. I‚Äôm currently in a relationship with a non binary person so gender and things of that nature get talked about enough to remind me of this box I‚Äôve shut tight. 
My dating preferences have skewed in the last year or so as well. I find myself more attracted to feminine men or gender non conforming people. So I‚Äôm left with the age ole- do I want to f*ck them or BE them? Like I‚Äôve said, I feel lost, and like I don‚Äôt know who I am. I may also be coming to realize that I‚Äôve never known. 

So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this. I can‚Äôt afford therapy right now to try and get to the bottom of these feelings, and I enjoy the idea of asking hmy community for help. Please read this and see if you have any parallels, or even if you have any thoughts. An objective opinion in crisis is golden. 

-With love, a ?maybe? trans woman."	"[deleted]
Thank you in advance to anyone (if anyone) decides to offer an opinion or advice.
Cis guys don't spend their entire life wanting to be a girl, sister.

Share your identity with someone close when you feel safe. Here's hoping you have some supporting family and/or friends!
I am in what feels like the exact same situation. I just left my own questioning story four minuates ago. Albeit mine is far less well written and detailed but I couldn't help but feeling the same imposter syndrome with my trans thoughts.

  I actualy have a story about my senior prom earily similar to your high school drag story üòÖ. I was invited by a very pretty girl one day so I showed up in a blue suit and halfway through emerged from the restroom in a royal purple size eight dress with ballroom elbow long gloves, and a long blonde wig. 

I'm also struggling with my thoughts and I find each night harder to sleep as I try to figure out my real identity. I don't know if I can offer any real help with my post. But I want to remind you that there are other people right now feeling the same internal war. I've seen how supportive and great this community is with eachother and I have no doubts others will comment far more helpful comments than mine. I wish you the best and sincerely hope you can find peace with this community like I seek to!
Sounds like you don't really know who you are yet, and that's fine, and that you like the idea of looking like a big busted woman in flashy clothes, which is of course also fine. In my view, that doesn't make you a woman. Being a woman isn't about big breasts or flashy clothes or a performance to attract attention. 

If you are dealing with a drinking problem and emotional health issues, you need to deal with those first. Puberty and adolescence are a whirlwind for many people because not only your body changes but everything changes. You go from being a child fully dependent on your parents to becoming physically mature and a fully independent adult. That's a major change that takes over the course of a relatively short time if you consider the typical human lifespan. If I were you I'd try to get to the bottom of what you think you'd gain from transition, what you might lose from transition, and what you think a woman is and why you think that you might be one and in what way you then aren't a man. 

Good luck! Don't rush anything. I'm in my thirties and still figuring life out. I remember when I was in primary school and saw teens cycling to high school, that they must've got it all figured out. Then when I was in high school I thought that of uni students. Then I was a uni student myself and was still sorting myself out, thinking that once people have steady jobs they must've got it all figured out. I'm there now. Turns out everyone is just flying by the seat of their pants. Of course some more than others, but identity, who you are, what life you want for yourself, who you want as friends and your chosen family, those things are active topics for many even as adults. I'm ok with that in my thirties I'm still trying to figure things out.
Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself! Your feelings are valid! 
Even though I experienced many different forms of dysphoria my whole life it took me lots of soul searching plus about 30 years (and a half year of therapy) to figure it all out! You are not alone and there‚Äôs no right or wrong:)
If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned from my own path of self discovery is that everyone‚Äôs journey is different and experiencing your feelings differently from somebody else doesn‚Äôt make you any less acceptable as a trans person. It seems like you‚Äôre well on your way along your path of self discovery, but even after you‚Äôve decided what you want there‚Äôs still a lot of emotional processing to do. Try to be patient with yourself.

It‚Äôs tough you can‚Äôt afford therapy, but know there are still resources that can help. The trans community is one of the most positive and accepting community I‚Äôve ever seen, and at the very least sharing experiences can help you not feel so alone.

To share some of my story you might relate to: I have also just recently become aware of feelings I‚Äôve been suppressing my whole life. I currently live in the basement of an extremely transphobic parent and it makes me feel very trapped. I‚Äôm terrified of coming out to my family, but it feels like I‚Äôll never be happy if I don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm only beginning to experiment with transitioning, but for now it‚Äôs something I only do when nobody is home. I‚Äôm not even sure what I want my future to look like, but I know the happiest parts of my life right now are when I get to express who I really am.

I am mtf and attracted to females. I came out to my wife about 2 weeks ago, who thankfully is bi (although semi-queer and also closeted). She needed some time to process, but has ultimately been very supportive. Having even a single person know about these feelings I had been keeping to myself for months has been huge for my emotional health.
Aight my guy/gal, as others have said, first you need to get the drinking and drugs under control. Once you've been clean for a while, you'll be ae to approach the issue with more clarity. I'd also suggest seeing a psychiatrist, as I know I personally felt similar symptoms (feeling angry all the time, often for no reason, looking for things to make me not think, etc.) before I was diagnosed with depression. Once I'd been on antidepressants for a while, I was honestly able to think better and actually focus on what the issues I have and had were. I know that might sound weird, but before being medicated, when I got un omfortable with things, it very quickly became, ""Is this seriously all life is? This emptiness and dissatisfaction? It just doesn't feel worth it."" The problem is, once you start thinking like that, you've actually stopped thinking about the source of the unhappiness and instead started wallowing in how it makes you feel. For me, depression meds helped me actually think about what it was that was making me feel that way in the first place.

Anyway, once you are sober and off the marijuana, and potentially on an antidepressant that is working for you if you do get diagnosed, then I'd say you should examine the situation again, but make sure you are doing it from a position of normal, everyday life. The average woman, even if she does have large boobs, isn't buying purses and wearing extravagant dresses on the daily. Try out just wearing women's clothes for a day and see how it feels. Try growing your hair out and applying some basic makeup. Ask yourself if the you that you see in the mirror when you try to appear feminine makes you happier or not, then ask yourself why. If your answer is purely sexual, then you need to examine if it might just be a fetish. If it is, that's okay, but you probably shouldn't make a life changing decision off of it if the desire ends when the horny does. Based on some of the things you've said, it sounds like this isn't the case, but only you can know for sure.
I know this is an old post. But huge parallels with you and your story and mine, so it‚Äôs really nice to hear(read) someone else feeling the exact same things from when they were a child and growing up! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you so much for the reply. I appreciate you taking the time out of your day, and wanted to let you know that I‚Äôll work on gaining some new perspectives. üíö"	n9rpnc	trans	32	0.96	2021-05-11 07:53:53
I came out to my GF last weekend	"She noticed that I had been buying more feminine stuff and self-grooming more, and she knows me pretty well since we've been dating for over 3 years, so I'm sure there were plenty of other signs she picked up on... But anyway she caught me off guard and just asked me if I was questioning my gender identity, and as you can tell by my post history I've been figuring it out for a little bit. But I wasn't ready to come out bc like I said she caught me off guard so I hedged and told her that I'd been figuring stuff out for a few weeks and that I was still working through it, but the anxiety of not knowing was driving her mad so the next night I broke down my whole life story and came out as a trans woman to her.

It was really hard and things were a little tense for a couple days... She's unbelieveably supportive, but it really hurt her that I hid this from her instead of telling her I was questioning from the start... I guess I just felt like this was something I had to know for myself first. But I think we're in a good place now. Like I said she's my #1 supporter, she even spent all day helping me shave my body yesterday :)

She occasionally uses the wrong name or pronouns but it's okay, I know it's an adjustment. We're taking it one step at a time. I couldn't be a luckier girl ‚ù§Ô∏è"	"These things do take time, and that can be hard, especially when you weren‚Äôt ready to come out yet (i came out to my family by accident), but if theyre supportive, it all works out in the end. Dont worry, and good job üíï
She needs to get over being hurt than you didn't tell her immediately. But apart from that, yay! I'm glad it went well.
Thank youuu ;\_\_\_\_; ‚ù§Ô∏è
We're working through it. She has past trauma from another transfem partner who hid their feelings, talked trash about her behind her back, and then dumped her, so I don't blame her for that... But things are going good, thank you  :)"	nz0pmg	trans	30	1.0	2021-06-13 16:58:02
Being punk and trans and thinking that passing is a dumb idea (at least the principle behind it)	"Hello ladies, fellers, and enbys! Just wanted to talk about somethin for a little bit. I just made a new account after using my old one with my deadname on it for five years and wanted to make a first post with it.

My name is Dahlia, and I'm a trans woman of 21. I've been officially out for almost two and a half years, and I've only been on HRT for two months. I'm not good at makeup, my executive dysfunction makes it hard to get out of bed and brush my teeth, never mind shaving. I don't usually wear what most people would consider ""feminine"" clothing, being that it's not my personal style and it's getting cold here in Denver, CO.

I'm pretty involved in the underground music scene in Denver; I play in two bands, [Flower Crown Me A Queen](https://flowercrownmeaqueen.bandcamp.com) and [Ludlow](https://ludlowmassacre.bandcamp.com), the latter of which has all trans members. I'm generally well known here as far as underground shows go, which are populated by folks like me: Gender-nonconforming, a rejection of the binary, disdain for authority and rules, and a presentation to match. I've got a beard, I dress in alternative fashion and I don't act explicitly feminine, because that's not who I am. I'm a firey, runaway cart that doesn't care if there are roadblocks in my path. I'm getting to where I'm trying to go.

I'm just having trouble reconciling these spaces where I am welcomed and appreciated and respected, not in spite of my being transgender, but very much because of it, and how I still get misgendered at work by customers, and by strangers on the street and in my neighborhood. I know that it's because of my unwillingness to pass, partly because I know I can't yet (so why bother?) and also because I shouldn't need to pass in order to be respected. I shouldn't need to bend over backwards for people who couldn't give less of a fuck if I fit into the boxes they try to stuff me into. They won't be satisfied until they can't tell the difference between a trans person and a cis person, and even then there's still laws being made about us and a murder rate that's phenomenally fucked up.

I don't wanna hide. [I don't want to have to force myself back into the closet if I can help it](https://sheherhers.bandcamp.com), and I want to make a world where people don't have to do that in order to be respected. I just want to be treated like a person, no strings attached, no fine print.

It was a lot easier when I was younger and there were less immediate consequences. Being a transgender adult in the US right now is a lot fucking harder than it should be, and I'm just mad about it. I needed to talk about it. It should be addressed and I don't know what avenues people would be willing to listen to. I'm frustrated, and tired. And I kinda just want to know that I'm not alone in this.

I'm sorry this post got so long. Thanks for sticking until the end."	"I don't pass. I was shoved to thr ground and kicked several times in the face yesterday. I want to pass so I don't have to fear for my wellbeing or get murdered.
You do you! 
Hi Dahlia. 

I will not kid you at all when I say I have no comprehension at all of your chosen lifestyle other than i totally respect you right to live it. 

I do however completely agree with regard to the principle outlined in your post. I have no idea why the gender choice of an individual has to be constantly referred too in daily life. Why has one's gender got to be suffixed on to every statement; Hello Sir or Hello Madam why on Earth can't people just say Hello?

If the constant reference to gender was removed from daily life you would not experience much of the prejudice you detail above. You have a right to be mad about it. I, for one, agree with you!

Being misgendered fucking sucks. Indeed‚Äîgetting gendered correctly most of the time shouldn‚Äôt have to involve struggling to adhere to outdated and oppressive cis norms of gender. As someone for whom struggling to pass isn‚Äôt worth the effort (for me, staying hydrated, sleeping, eating, and maybe getting to class and doing my schoolwork is hard enough), though I‚Äôm lucky enough that some folks around me respect my pronouns‚ÄîI feel you. Giving you a proud trans girl hug from my college in PA (near Philadelphia)
Yo! Whaddup from a Denver enbey!!! (You're right. It is getting *cold*) 

Not too big into the music scene so I probably haven't seen you play but perhaps I'll check y'all out. :)

I've slowly come to realize that I'm not ever going to ""pass"" as non-binary. Perhaps in certain circles someone might take the hint but to the vast majority of the world I will always be seen as one or the other. I do a lot of shit to drop those hints too so I have wondered on occasion why the fuck I even bother. But then I remember everybody has a ""you do you"" and I might as well be me. 
Executive Dysfunction is described as ‚Äúa disruption to the efficacy of of the executive functions, which is a group of cognitive processes that regulate or control other cognitive processes.‚Äù As a person with ADHD, my personal executive dysfunction manifests itself in an inability to plan, perform simple habitual tasks, remember things correctly or at all (I often times forget to eat because, well, it just isn‚Äôt on my mind), and focus and concentrate on important tasks. [WebMD has a wonderful article](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/executive-function) if you‚Äôd like to know more :)

I imagine Executive Dysphoria would be a hellish combination of the two, which fucking sucks if that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm experiencing now lol"	7i92hl	trans	28	0.9	2017-12-07 19:43:36
Parents, am I right?	"TW: Transphobia.

I could drink, smoke, go out to parties and get hammered, etc, and my mom wouldn‚Äôt get mad. But if I were to tell her I want to be a girl, that‚Äôd cross the line & make her mad. Can‚Äôt believe it."	"That‚Äôs rough
I agree with the other commenter. Those are entirely different things. And a good parent would not be comfortable with most of them. It's not okay for underage kids to stay out all night and go to parties etc etc. At least some parents still care about what their kids do
These are COMPLETELY different things. You didn't change from chocolate to strawberry ice cream. You changed EVERYTHING. I support your decision to come out. But, make no mistake. You may think you're the same person. But, you're not to them or anyone else. Your family, friends, and the world aren't at a point that gives everyone a free pass when they change their gender. Everyone who has transitioned and will transition. Has had and will have consequences that have and will yet have to face. If you didn't take that into consideration. That's your mistake little sister.
Ummm, doesn't excuse them for not accepting her for who she is? I think you're being a little harsh.

The way I viewed it, I have never been myself until I started transitioning and expressing myself.
I know they‚Äôre completely different, just confused on why she‚Äôd get mad at me for wanting to be a girl over the other things. It confuses me, mainly.
And you're reading something I didn't say. I'm not excusing them for not accepting her for who she is. But, she has to expect things like this are a possibility. Before I made my decision to transition. I took into consideration that I was going to lose family and friends. I prepared myself for it before it happened. I'm glad I did. My father disowned me because I was no longer his son. His negativity is his own. I will not take ownership of his negativity. We need disowned me he disowned his one and only granddaughter. His loss not mine. My mother went through a mourning period that lasted 2 years. It took a very wise friend that set me straight. I told him ""I'm the same person you've always known."" But, I wasn't. He knew me as my former self for 30 years. We built up our friendship and develop the dialogue that we both understood about each other. Now, I'm Charlotte. He now has to work out a completely different dialogue with me. He doesn't know if the same jokes will offend me or not. I may be the same person at my core with my beliefs and my heart. But my outer being, my outer appearance has changed and it takes time for other people to get used to it. I'm not accusing anybody. I just want her to be more realistic in her expectations.
Please understand, I'm not excusing them for being mad at you. This isn't something like changing from Coke to Pepsi. In their eyes you've now become a completely different person. One that they weren't aware of. I have no idea how much information they have on the transgender community. You may feel like the same person inside. The same beliefs and the same habits. Your heart and soul may not have changed. But to them, they suddenly don't know who you are. This is something that I'm going to have to ask you to give them time on. Your parents deserve the biggest learning curve of all. Remember, they've been in your life since the very beginning. You probably read stories about other parents that instantaneously accepted their son or daughter. You've also read hardcore stories transgender people being cast out and ostracized and left homeless by their families. That's one extreme going to the other. Where are you and that storyline. Be patient with them. This is a very delicate and sensitive time for you both.
Tbh it sound like you've internalized what happened and rationalized their behavior to yourself. You keep saying"" I'm not excusing them"" but that's exactly what your doing. Its not fair the way your parents treated you, and its unfair the way OP's parents treated them. Saying ""you should expect this reaction because it's just so hard on them"" is internalized transphobia.
Yeah, I want to let them learn and give them time, but I think I‚Äôll wait until I move out before doing that, just to be safe. But I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôll pan out ATM.
TBH, you don't know me and you don't know my parents. You don't know what we've all been through in our lives. My mother was 77 years old when I came out to her and my father was 78. They've known me for 53 years at the time that I came out to them. Being transgender is very new to them. The word transgender never even entered their vocabulary until I said it to them. Internalized transphobia? If You're expecting every parent after being told the news that their child is transgender. Just suddenly welcome their child with open arms. To say I'm glad you told us, because we're well versed and know all about being transgender. Where to help you and support you. What do you need from us? Then you've been living in a television show and a movie. Life, doesn't work that way. This is reality. Everybody's journey and everybody's path on their transition and realizing that they are transgender. Is different from every other transgender person. The first person that tells you that they know everything about being transgender. It's full of sh!t. And to say whether one person's parents are fair or unfair. That person isn't living in reality. Life isn't fair. But if you think it is. You're welcome to it. And have a great time condemning everybody that can't accept everybody for who they are. But, you'd better get used to disappointment. I've learned not to take ownership of other people's negativity. You should stop focusing on it and diagnosing people. Especially if you don't have a medical degree.
I'm gonna level with you as I've leveled with them. They seem to be struggling with internalized transphobia, which is something I myself struggled with for a long time. Truth is, if your parents didn't care about you doing drugs, partying, and getting hammered, but do care about you transitioning, they don't care about your best interests. Not saying relentlessly beat them over the head with it, but you need to stand firm for who you are, for your sake. Continuing to hide yourself to appease mean people will not do you any good. I don't know what it's like with them, but alot of people who adamantly oppose trans people are woefully uneducated on it. If it wouldn't put you in danger, they may need to know what being in the wrong body is like. I like the arguement as follows, ""say aliens abducted 2 people, a man and a woman. And the aliens swapped their brains around, and sent them back to earth. They both have all the memories they had now but everyone around them will regard them as the gender of their body, even though they know it's wrong, and they don't know the first thing about acting as the wrong gender. How would you fix this? Since humans can't swap brains around?"" Usually the adage leads to ""You would want to change the body to the one your meant to be"" which is how HRT works. And simply, science has found in recent years that babies can develop the opposite genders brain structure, even if they have the ""correct"" chromosomes. That's one of many causes of gender dysphoria, If you need more help with gathering information or sources, hit me up in the DMs and I'd be glad to help you out, sorry for the long ass post, hope it helps! ^-^
Giving them time to digest this news process it. This may be an opportunity for them to educate themselves. I know that you don't know how this is going to pan out. But giving it time and patience. Will help you calm your nerves. It may also help you prepare for the next meeting. There's not one transgender person that I know on this planet that ever wished that they were transgender. This is not the easiest decision that we have to make. In fact it's the hardest thing we've ever had to do. Some people call us brave. That may be true. But, some people live there entire lives and never discover who they are. We, transgender community. We discovered who we are and with therapy, medications, and possible surgeries. We have the opportunity to correct nature's mistake. To bring us as close as we possibly can to our true authentic selves. Every transgender person's path is completely different from the next person. Some have it easy and some have an incredibly hard.

You're now part of a community that will love you and care for you and support you. You're not alone. There are a hundreds of thousands of us out there. We all might be different. But our goal to be our true authentic self the same. I wish you good luck in the future. üåπ
Right yeah, your experience had led you to internalize the idea that it's alright or should expected to be treated that way, and you've tried to pass that down onto a new generation who doesn't need to accept that fate because times are changing. So stop telling people what to expect based on what happened to you what decades ago? My life has been a long story just as anyone's, and now that I can see your true colors upon being questioned solidifies my beliefs that your unwilling to change yourself to help a new generation. You started by saying your not excusing her parents, and yet here you are, using your experience to explain how it's actually acceptable to be treated this way by your parents. The person they knew isn't gone, the gender is. And we need to as a community stand up for the normalization that we're allowed to be angry at the injustice and expect better of our family to accept and love us for who we are. I m not mad at you for having these opinions. Like I said I had to come to terms with alot of internalized transphobia from my abusive ex BF, and having ""manliness"" forced upon me my whole life. Your opinion is simply a bit outdated and as a community we need to move forward and demand change, not accept bigotry. I have nothing in my heart but love for you and any other trans person because we're all struggling through this slog together, im sorry for the way you were treated, and I hope you are treated better in the future.
I stopped reading your text after the first sentence. I don't even know or care whether you have a degree in psychology, sociology or any kind of medicine. What I don't appreciate is being psychoanalyzed by an amateur. My comments are for the author alone. I knew what the age of 14 I was a woman. I spent 40 years in hiding. At the age of 53 I finally decided to transition. I began transitioning 3 years ago. As of this October I'll have been on HRT for 3 years. Never compare your experiences with mine. We are two completely different people that have gone through two completely different lives. Unless you're prepared to show everyone here in a degree in one of the professions that I mentioned before. Keep your psychoanalyst to yourself. You're only going to hurt someone. I've had my discussions with the author. We seem to be fine with each other. So drop it. I've survived shit that you would be scared to even think of. And I'm still standing. Never compare your life to mine. So once again. Drop it.
I feel sorry for you. I'm glad you were able to accept yourself at least. And be glad that future generations don't have to go through what you went through if we work together to call out bigotry."	o4fmzc	trans	28	0.9	2021-06-20 21:32:53

Daughter came out to her dad ‚ù§Ô∏è but not as planned	"Hello all I have been given great support on the situation I have been going though with my step daughter (13mtf). I happy to says that my step daughter has come out to his dad who is in the military and deployed. We needed up FaceTime him but I did tell him that his ‚Äúson‚Äù has something ‚Äúhe‚Äù would like to talk to you about. He was thinking it was just going to be about ‚Äúhis‚Äù report card or Christmas stuff. 

She did dress in boy mode and letter prepared. She was nervous and I was nervous but she proud that she said it. Her dad was in shock and we both waited in anticipation. For him to say ‚Äúwait are you saying and can‚Äôt believe this‚Äù. Then his connection is lost!!! Immediately my step daughter just breaks down and starts to cry hysterical. As someone who is transgender as well I know how she is feeling not to feel accepted and I just laid down with her to comforter her. However then I started to get very mad at him because me, his wife, who is transgender cannot be supportive to his own child at is the same. 

How is this going to be for us in the future but just a little over a hour later. He FaceTimes back. OMG was I upset!!! I totally assumed he was not being supportive and I just lost it. After I let him speak he told me that I was assuming the wrong thing.  He was totally understanding that his daughter came out as transgender it was just a moment of bad timing at the wrong moment of time.

To see him chat with his daughter and say that he loves her. Just made this year they best. Even better then our wedding. 

I know when we say this story many years for now we are just going to get a good laugh out of it."	"I'm so glad he's supportive of both of you! Sounds like she has a good role model too, the fact you didn't even hesitate to stand up for her is amazing!

Jokes aside though, So glad to hear it all worked out! Got any celebration plans for when her dad returns?

"Ok so let's talk about ""passing"""	"So I see a lot of people talk about how their life would be perfect if they just passed. So I passed really well even before I started hormones, so ofc I don't have the full picture of passing and not passing as I mostly have passed in my life, so keep that in mind, this is just my side.

So, I'm not like super openly trans, it's not a thing I share with people except my close friends cause I kinda don't feel like I need to, the problem with that being that sometimes I end up with friends or meet people at parties who are kinda not ok with trans people ect and it can be a really spooky experience. Also a lot of people who think I'm attractive ect don't know, and sometimes I end up hooking up with someone but like when do I tell them, and it's such an humiliating thing when they get mad cause I've tricked them. I really can't get a boyfriend cause so few boys are ok with dating a trans girl in my country and it's such a crushing defeat when people ask me on dates and turn me down again when I tell them.

Atleast when you don't fully pass, all the friends and people who like you like you for who you are, and people who would not be ok with you stay away. I know it's better than being beaten in the streets, I'm not trying to say it's worse to pass, just that no matter if you pass or not you will never ever be a cis woman and will always struggle with trans related issues in life. Love y'all and stay safe inn these weird timesüíïüíïüíï"	"The best policy is to be honest as soon as you know someone is interested. It will only hurt you if you try to hide it till later. I pass really well too and have had to talk potential dates about it and yeah it's awkward, but important.
To be honest if it‚Äôs safe, then why don‚Äôt you just be open about you being transgender? If you were a completely open book to the men you date and people you meet from the beginning then you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about people not liking you once they find out or about tricking people?"	gad87k	trans	28	0.95	2020-04-29 17:06:09
TW: Partner being Unsupportive	"I am sorry, but I just need to vent and get this off my chest. I told my partner that I was planning to start HRT next Wednesday before my first gender therapist appointment. She told me that she thought that was a mistake and that she is mad at me for doing it this way. She is the only one that I am out to, and part of me doesn‚Äôt want to share anymore of this with her.

The idea of letting someone else control this process gives me anxiety and make me want to stop all therapy all together and shut everyone out. So, to me even having HRT and potentially not taking it right away puts all the power in my court and makes it feel like my choice and not someone else‚Äôs."	"Someone out there will love you exactly as you are, and exactly as you're going to be. Maybe it's your gf or maybe not, but don't let someone else control your choices
> She told me that she thought that was a mistake and that she is mad at me for doing it this way.

I'm curious if there's actually anything she'd find agreeable aside from the status quo. Some amount of conflicted feelings and anxieties are totally understandable, but it's your body and your happiness comes first.

Hope things get better and congratulations on HRT üíñ
It is so your choice and I am (i think) living worst case scenario. I came out to my wife and we are getting a divorce. Her and our friend tried to convince me to do conversion therapy but it ain‚Äôt happenin!!! No one can control it but you. Dm if you wanna talk <3.
I completely get where your coming from. I came out to my partner and they have been supportive but aren‚Äôt ready for me to start hrt yet. I might end up having to wait  10-11 months to start hrt when my local clinic just last week got through their wait list, there‚Äôs no wait right now when it‚Äôs normally 2-4 months. I‚Äôm not in control of my body right now and I struggle daily with it, it hurts a lot, knowing there‚Äôs medicine out there to help me, within my reach but I can‚Äôt touch it. 

Now I understand that this I my choice, if I really wanted to I could go forward with this without their wishes but at the same time it‚Äôs not just my choice anymore, I‚Äôm married to the most beautiful person in the world. I love them so much, we are a team and in this together so their opinion matters on this, it‚Äôs a big decision. 

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is I feel your pain, and if you want to stay with your partner I highly suggest keeping them in the loop of your decisions, let them know what your thinking and how your doing. Keeping communication open and in good faith is crucial and my partner and I are in a better place now than we were when I originally came out 7 months ago. There‚Äôs going to be a lot of hard talks and you both won‚Äôt see eye to eye on a lot of things but I think it‚Äôs important to realize that if you want to stay together this effects them too. You don‚Äôt always have to agree but they should at least know what‚Äôs going on, don‚Äôt shut them out, this will only hurt them and you.

There have been many things that we don‚Äôt agree on but we talked out and worked out most things. Does your partner have any support network? I would suggest therapy for them too if they want it and having a close friend that you have given them permission to talk to about this can help a lot, having someone they trust that they can vent to about this really helps. I would also suggest they take a look at r/mypartneristrans for some support. I go there every now and then as is feel it helps me better understand what my partner might be going through.
One partner I had said he wouldn‚Äôt let me take estrogen because of the possible side effects
Come out to more people, I guess, if you can, because you need more support than that. 

Sometimes relationships don't work out. People change. And you're making major changes. Which is great! But she might not be there for you in the long run. 

Protect yourself and your assets. Don't let her hurt you on the way out if things go south. People do and say all kinds of hurtful shit when they break up. Don't take any of it to heart.
I think she thinks this is a decision I made in a month. But it‚Äôs something that has been in the back of my mind for years. Everything has been just coming to a front here lately for me.
It‚Äôs almost always something we‚Äôve thought about for years (decades even) and eventually we have some moment that makes those feelings and thoughts crystallize and we feel that need to address it.  To outsiders looking in, it seems sudden because we generally didn‚Äôt share our private ruminations.  The social pressure is very intense to not discuss such thoughts."	x42bp3	trans	26	0.9	2022-09-02 14:02:43

He is what happens when your greed far exceeds your empathy.
I try my best to forget Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro exist. Definitely try and focus on happier things as we don‚Äôt owe them our fear like they think we do. Being trans is tough enough without giving outspoken transphobes the time of day.
Honestly it helps me to remember that Matt Walsh isn‚Äôt a person, he‚Äôs a demon in human flesh. The dude is a creep that got rich being a fuckin prick.
Matt Walsh is a fascist pedophile and Andrew Tate is a sex trafficker. It's horrendous that either of them are allowed a platform to spew this senseless hate.
Really? I'm quite new here and find that angering. Just try to stay optimistic ok? Worrying about it to no end will get you nowhere, deep breaths ok? Don't let some loser on here ruin a single second of your time, they ain't worth it!
I only know Andrew Tate as that guy who went on a rant on Twitter about how Starwars is for babies and he‚Äôs a real man‚Ñ¢Ô∏è for likening cars instead or something like that.
If it weren‚Äôt for the fact most of them are bigots, I‚Äôd feel bad for anyone misguided enough to take whatever someone like that says seriously.
This post is similar to a lot of others about Matt Walsh. Who cares what this nut job spouts off. He‚Äôs a Alex Jones clone against trans people. I‚Äôll say what I say in every post I see like this. STOP FEARMONGERING it‚Äôs not healthy for you, me, or anyone in these subreddits for trans people.
The problem with Matt Walsh is that we live in a culture where you can make money, lots of money, with hate.  For me I think it‚Äôs just best to ignore these types and focus on improving intersectional support.
Matt's problem is that he is a grifter. He gets money from being hateful, so he is. I doubt he actually has any moral values or beliefs. Like all of the conservative 'thought leaders' he will do anything and everything if he's paid for it. Of course, he also assumes that everyone else works the same way. People like that cannot comprehend that some people actually want to make the world a better place.
yea I think if the media didn't follow the logic ""if something is controversial let's spread it without any filter or context, just make sure everyone hears it!!!"" no one would even know these people or would have forgotten about them after 10 minutes, which is honestly what they deserve to be treated like. Like okay I listened to your dumb stuff for 10 minutes, now there's a short moment in my life where I knew of your existence, but since you offer absolutely no genuine substance this moment will not extend :)
wouldn‚Äôt it be funny if the reason he‚Äôs like this is that at one point he asked out a trans woman who shot him down, and he‚Äôs had a chip on his shoulder ever since.
Whats scaring me is that there are a lot of andrew state supporters on this sub, its madness
Wrong spot...huh, well I hope me being silly makes your day brighter
Sometimes I feel like Walsh is just a sad trans woman trapped very very very very very deep in the closet.

That or he is just an insufferable cunt

I am a woman. Not just a trans woman, but a woman.	So a lot of cis people are comfortable with me calling myself a trans woman. But when I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a woman in the exact same way a cis woman is a woman, i.e. we experience womanhood in the exact same way‚Äù they get mad. What gives??	"People have their own ideas of what things are supposed to be and aren't well equipped to have their thoughts challenged.
I try and avoid saying don‚Äôt waste your time worrying about them, but you can‚Äôt allow their arrogance to bother you. Old hateful attitudes are often hard for some to drop for some people. You‚Äôre a woman.
Well if you‚Äôre a trans woman, you‚Äôre a woman. That‚Äôs pretty much it regardless of how clueless people may be. You also need to understand that changes take time and, little by little, reality and overall day to day life will make normal things ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. See, if they need to label you trans is because there is something that causes them an emotional reaction to the fact.

I know it might be exhausting, but analyzing  those feelings and helping them sort them out could be beneficial to speed up the process of normalization of what at the end of the day is normal and has always been.

Yeah, yeah, you‚Äôre not anyone‚Äôs mother to be educating peeps on what and why, but I think biting the bullet and doing precisely that for the meanwhile is a better sport than just going ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt understand me you cis bigot‚Äù.

Hateful reactions never helped solving a situation. If they go transphobic on you, as long as it is not violently, you can score yourself a honest victory knowing that time will prove you right. Engaging in insults will only further hate. You can‚Äôt really fight fire with fire, right? ^^

Edit: typos
Because they're assholes 

Like theirs some obvious differences particularly in childhood and socialization but be transitioned long enough and the differences become functionaly meaningless

Hell the differences already start pretty meaningless outside of Healthcare.
Probably because we don't experience womanhood in the exact same way. And yet we do.


 I mean this in the kindest way possible.  

I'm sitting on the floor of my bathroom crying, responding, clutching my stomach.  

I don't have female reproductive organs, and likely never will unless science makes a major change.  

And yet, so many women talk about similiar moments crying alone.  

I dunno.  Maybe I relate to other women every time I stand up.
Neurotypicals don't have the required brain wiring to understand this I'm afraid.
Don't worry u're a woman
Hmm. I hear what you‚Äôre saying. But there are cis women who are born without ‚Äúfemale‚Äù reproductive organs. So I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what makes someone a woman.
[removed]
Maybe only the sky and the wind really have the answer to what makes someone a woman.

"My girlfriend cheated on me and I've never felt more insecure about myself not being ""whole"""	"Hey yall, 


Warning long post.¬†


I didn't really know where else to go. My friend suggested finding a support group for transmen like myself but I didn't really know where to look or where to go so I'm just doing this and hopefully the down votes won't be too unkind.


I've always know, like everybody else here I'm sure, that something was missing and wrong about my body. Ever since I was a little kid.¬†


I've been on testosterone for years and years now¬†which honestly saved my life but it wasn't the miracle cure I prayed it would be - nothing in life ever is that easy, is it?


My last girlfriend had been formerely married to a transman which was so reassuring and made everything feel so much easier but that endly badly. In hindsight, I think she was a fetish translover. 


My current girlfriend, Kay, I knew her since high school so she¬†was well aware of my history. Right when we first reconnected after almost ten years, she had freshly broken up with her boyfriend, Tommy. We really hit it off though. She had a huge crush on me all the way back then. She was a bit of a loner nerd and I¬†was a strangely popular¬†art kid, I barely knew her but I would¬†draw her pictures and give them to her inbetween classes. Fast forward to now though, Kay drinks alot, truth be told,¬†and it doesn't make anything particularly easy.¬†


A few weeks into us talking,¬†I'll never remember how or what lead into it but she told me drunkenly one night what¬†""huge dick"" her ex-boyfriend¬†Tommy had. My heart and guts just about fell out of my ass when she said that. And¬†I never forgot it. What I wouldn't give to unhear it. Whenever I'm having a bad moment or day (you all know the ones)¬†all I¬†can hear is her saying that and it damn near brings me to tears. 


Kay and I have been dating for two years now and it's rocky but we love each other very much. But then the Pandemic happened. We don't live together. She lives alone now and I still live with my parents - even though I'm self-admittedly¬†too old for that but I'm so fortunate they're so understanding and they worry about me alot.¬†I've been taking the entirely situation to a silly level of caution,¬†being diagnosed with pretty hefty OCD doesn't help, (sanatizing groceries, changing out of my clothes as soon as I get home, I leave my ""street shoes"" outside. Plus it's Florida, need I say more?). Kay - she just doesn't really do any of that. I've been on the phone with her when she went to the rest room in a gas station and I blurted out shocked¬†""you really¬†aren't going to wash your hands??"" So I haven't seen her since March and it's my fault. It is. I¬†should have tried harder, I admit that, but not a day goes by I don't communicate with her. And miss her.¬†


My best friend got married two weeks ago, it was the first time I've gotten to see Kay in months. And while the wedding was beautiful and I was in the bridal party, I couldn't help but finding myself just¬†staring at her and smiling almost the whole time. I drove her home, twelve hour drive, and stayed the night with her and the following day. It was great, felt like no time had passed. But then I went home took two covid tests over a 7 day period and quarantined. Now I'm the nerd, haha.¬†


Then two nights ago, she told me that she felt it was time for her to bring me all my belongs at her house back, she didn't want them anymore. Which hurt but she does that from time to time, especially when she's been drinking.¬†So,¬†we were texting back and forth a the night about a transman she knew growing up who was dating her best friend. The best friend cheated on the transman and I told her that the hurt of being cheated on is never easy for anyone but for a transman, when the woman you love cheats on you with a cisgendered guy - it's a different level of hurt. It's like being completely eviscerated. I know it is that way for me. The endless voices in your head whispering ""well maybe if you were whole things would be different"" which I know is stupid and wrong¬†but I can't help it.


So then she calls me. And says, ""I have something to tell you and you're not going to like it. I had sex with Tommy [a month ago]."" I knew she was meeting up with him because their relationship ended poorly with a tendency towards some mutual¬†violence¬†and he wanted to finally have a conversation. Fully trusting her as I did, I told her she absolutely should because they owed it to each other,¬†and reiterated that I trusted her implicitly. 


Guess I shouldn't have.¬†


After me blubbering like an idiot, she says ""well you never asked"", doesn't truly trusting your partner mean you don't have to ask if they fucked their ex-boyfriend on the new mattress you bought her? 


So. That's that. I'm feeling lost at sea and I don't think I've ever been more disgusted with my own body. I know it was her being completely drunk, desperately wanting attention and to feel desired¬†but the fact it was Tommy - it makes me physically ill.¬†


I told her that I've never forgotten what she told me about him being well endowed. She got mad at me and said I'd never let her live it down. I lost my temper there, reminding her I haven't brought it since she told me it made HER feel bad but I went on to say that in so many words that I've spent more time thinking about his dick than she ever had in her life. Which totally broke her, I think. She really started crying then.¬†


I'm ashamed as hell to say this, but I'm not proud of being transgendered. I have an endless respect of those brave enough to say it and embrace it¬†but I just¬†feel embarrassed about my body. Even after all these years. I would love to learn how to to love myself.¬†


I don't know why I shared this here. I don't know why I shared it with anyone but I'm just so hurt and don't know what the hell I'm doing. While I'm very fortune to have quite a few good friends, who empathize deeply, they just don't and, respectfully, can't understand how truly hurt I am by the entirety of this situation.


I don't know what to do. I still love her so much but when I was at work today, thinking of them together that night¬†hit me with such an intense wave of nausea that I almost had to pull over. I want her to know how badly and deeply hurt I am but I don't want to hurt her feelings, even still.¬†"	"that's... incredibly painful. I think this might be a good opportunity to just practice knowing your self worth--hard as it is. Best of luck and hugs
I'm sorry this happened to you. If she wanted to experiment with something sexually that should have been a conversation between the two of you. If you really have full trust in your partner you should be able to talk about this stuff with them, and if you really love them you should want to. I think this happened because she was the type of person capable of doing it, not because you weren't enough of a man. I think the idea that people cheat because their partner wasn't fulfilling them is, in most cases, a manipulation tactic. It seems like an easy way to shift the blame onto the victim. It's easy to internalise other people's issues when they direct them at you. I hope you're able to find some peace.
Thank you, friend. I appreciate that.
She is completely capable of cheating. Prior to me she only ever had two boyfriends (but probably a dozen actual partners); that Tommy and one other who was her high-school boyfriend, James, and they were together like six years - James and Kay both cheated on each other relentlessly. She's very insecure sexually but very carefree about her body, whereas I'm the exact opposite, I'm extremely confident sexually but not whatsoever about my actual self. 

She never really made me feel like it was because of how I am physically but blamed it on being lonely, saying ""how long am I suppose to wait [to see you again]?"" Which in the back of my mind I'm screaming between waiting for me and fucking your ex, I think most partners would answer I expect you to wait indefinitely between those two options. Thank you for that insight, it is a good way to think of it - even by blaming it on feeling lonely, it's a still a way of pushing the blame back onto me and absolving herself a little. 

I really want to talk to her and tell her how devastated I am about the whole thing but even so, even now, I don't want to hurt her feelings. 

But hey, thank you very much for your response. It really meant alot to me. I hope you have a great weekend."	jxkazw	trans	27	0.95	2020-11-20 06:46:10
black market hrt	"I found out tonight that a girl i go to group therapy passed away due to black market hormone usage. To say the least i‚Äôm shocked, she seemed so lively in group and never said anything that would make me suspect she would even look into underground hormones. Other than my shock, i‚Äôm mostly mad. I looked into the problem of underground HRT- or tried to look i guess, all the articles about it i could find are years out. I‚Äôm frustrated that this issue that effects my community so deeply isn‚Äôt talked about at all in the public eye. All i keep thinking about is her prancing into group this past summer telling everyone about her new affirming clothes- including a bathing suit. 
RIP angel, i will never forget. "	"I would very much so doubt that that was the only thing that killed her, even the quasi-legal pharmacies that sell 'black market' hormones aren't entirely unregulated, they're just based in areas that have little regulation. What was the cause of death ultimately? A blood clot that was attributed to her diying and then blamed on the pills themselves?
I'm so sorry, may she rest in peace.

How crazy is it that in the country I'm in, it's safer to get meds online and DIY, rather than follow the doctors?
i‚Äôm not sure tbh- the family was never very accepting and doesn‚Äôt seem to want to include the trans support group she was in as apart of this process, we‚Äôre lucky they even told us at all "	9ltdlx	trans	25	0.95	2018-10-06 04:48:00
I (15) need advice.	"I‚Äôm a fifteen-year-old mtf. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve had dysphoria about my gender for more than a year or two now, and for the last few months I‚Äôve been so confused about this all. I know I want to be a girl but at the same time it‚Äôs more complicated than that. A couple months ago I told my mom about how I‚Äôve been feeling, and I was terrified when I did. I didn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôd say, it was the first time I‚Äôd ever told her about anything like that. She asked me if I knew if I wanted anything definitive about it then, and I responded that I didn‚Äôt know. Which was true at the time; but now I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs too late, or something, I don‚Äôt know. I understand that it‚Äôs never too late, but I don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs happening to my body. And my voice is deeper and I‚Äôm growing hair everywhere and every time I stop to think about it I panic. I want to do something. 

My dad doesn‚Äôt know yet. He‚Äôs made it pretty clear in the past that he doesn‚Äôt like the whole LGBT+ crew, and that‚Äôs why my mother said not to tell him. I‚Äôm scared to. Terrified, even more than I was with my mom, I can‚Äôt imagine I could even open my mouth if I‚Äôm alone with him, telling him about me. And if he didn‚Äôt support me; if he got mad for the sheer idea of suggesting what I am, i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôd do.

I don‚Äôt wear anything particularly ‚Äúgirly‚Äù, other than I paint my nails sometimes when my dad isn‚Äôt home. I have two skirts and some girly clothes i stole from my sisters. My sisters. I have three of them, two older (18 and 17) and one younger (12), and only one of the older ones, 17, knows about my feelings. I want to try makeup or something to school, hopefully get to the point of actually wearing girly stuff out.

Recently, I‚Äôve been thinking about the process of transitioning. I don‚Äôt know how it works, anything even remotely close to what I have to do in order to get to that point, and I feel helpless. I‚Äôve been procrastinating long enough, so I want to do something. I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt a good post, if you need any information or have any questions, please ask if you can help me. I‚Äôm sorry if this post was a train wreck. Just please give me some advice. Thank you."	"Don't worry about it, you're only 15. You have plenty of time to figure yourself out and plenty of time to transition. I'm pretty sure at 15 years old the most you can do is go on blockers (correct me if I'm wrong, I myself am only 14 and not out to any family) so you're in no way too late. If you're feeling insecure about your voice, you can try voice training, and if it helps to know this, body hair is completely normal for everyone and it's not that hard of a problem to fix compared to other things. (I think, once again I'm only going by word here) I know I'm not that helpful, but I wanted to leave you with something. Hope all goes well <3
It makes complete sense to be anxious but you're not wasting time at all- You can take as much time as you need. There are people who find out they're trans in their 50's and still get to transition all the way. If you want you could start with really small things and build up to bigger things as you get more confident, like putting on a tiny bit of blush or concealer, or wearing womens hoodies, jeans, shirts that could still pass as male, or getting nice/comforting things for yourself that feel more girly to you. You don't have to tell your dad at all until you feel completely safe. Having trans friends or asking teachers to call you a different name (if you have a name you like and you think your teachers wouldn't be assholes about it) would probably make you feel much better, as well. I won't be able to get hormones until I'm in my mid-twenties probably, but I'm 18 and still feel good ab myself some days even having fully gone through the wrong puberty! you've got this! good luck
Your never helpless. The whole thing is complicated to process when you start thinking about it. Take care to deeply think about the WHY you think and feel you do or don‚Äôt. I thought about transition for years‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt have anyone to help me. Your lucky it sounds like you‚Äôre family cares(mostly). 
I Just made an appointment to just talk about my feelings with my doc. No HRT just talk. This can and will affect your future. good and bad if you need to go through with it. There‚Äôs never a way to be sure 100% just processed with caution. Good luck
Honestly I'm not sure how to help you, you could ask your mom to go on hormones without telling dad, but i don't know if you'd be allowed. Some people do hormones diy, but generally you should avoid that

Also you have a really similar username to my irl friend (Texas) lol
I read your post last night and I have been thinking about it ever since.  I hope my comments are helpful, if not please ignore them.  I am a trans woman and I am a teacher, so I have a lot of interest in trans youth.

I think the most important thing is your own safety.  First, your physical safety.  As you explore your gender more, please be cautious as you head out and about.  Your mental safety is important also.  If you don't feel safe telling your dad, please listen to your instincts.  I know it can be super rough living in an unsupportive space, but it might be the safest place. If you feel like you might harm yourself please, please reach out to some place like the Trevor Project to get help right away.  Also, if you are considering running they can help you find a place to land.  

For actually transitioning the good news there is no right or wrong path, only your path.  Personally, I started by crossdressing.  After seeing truly seeing myself for the first time I knew what I had to do, but it took me another 11 years to do anything.  To start medical transition it usually takes a counselor and a doctor.  The counselor gives the diagnoses of gender dysphoria, and  doctor prescribes medicines for treatment.  I believe most people your age would start with puberty blockers and after about a year would move towards hormone replacement.   I know a year sounds like a SUPER long time, but the current treatment standards are designed to give you time and experience to make the best long term decision.  Transition is a slow journey, be prepared for everything to take longer than expected.  The waiting is totally disheartening, so be mentally prepared.  Hormone therapy is serious stuff, and it can be dangerous, please don't self medicate.    

Finally, if your parents are book worms at all you might consider having them read some memoirs written by some parents of transgender kids.  The first I would recommend is Becoming Nicole by Amy Ellis Nutt.  It is the story of raising Nicole Maines and her transition.  While Nicole is the central subject of the book, it is more about how her parents had to transition too.  Her father specifically had a lot of trouble accepting his daughter, but now he is a huge advocate for trans rights.  The second is About a Girl by Rebekah Robertson.  It is the story of Georgie Stone and her transition and the role her parents, especially her mother, played.  They are from Australia, so it isn't quite as close as Becoming Nicole.  

Again, please be safe and take care of yourself.
I started transitioning at 20yrs old. It's never too late and everything you feel is normal. Live life the way YOU want.
I'm almost certain 15 year olds can go on hrt
Thanks for your help, even if it isn‚Äôt much. I‚Äôve just been so insecure about this lately. Thank you <3
Thank you so much. I‚Äôll try and take your advice, ask my mom to buy some clothes that could still pass as male, to make myself feel better, and try some other things you said. I don‚Äôt know of anyone in my school that‚Äôs trans, and asking people to call me a different name just sounds.. scary, i guess, I‚Äôm not sure.

Nonetheless, thank you for the encouraging words and for trying to help me <3
Okay, thank you. I‚Äôll try and talk to my mother, if I can get over the initial worry once again, just to see if we can talk to a doctor or something about it. thanks
yeah, don‚Äôt mind my username. hate that you can‚Äôt change it on reddit, it‚Äôs so cringy..

thanks for your help though. I‚Äôve been thinking of asking her, but some other comments on here said you can‚Äôt start hrt until 16. Also I live in missouri, so I don‚Äôt know if that affects it at all.
I would like to begin by thanking you immensely, this really is helpful. 

I‚Äôve never thought about hurting myself or running away, but I‚Äôll certainly keep it in mind if it ever comes to that.

As for the next part.. yeah. I crossdress sometimes, but never around the house, since my other two sisters still don‚Äôt know about it. Usually, if I crossdress, I do it when I‚Äôm home alone or in my room with the door closed. I‚Äôve never done it around anyone, only by myself. I guess I‚Äôm worried to admit that I‚Äôve stolen some of their clothes‚Ä¶

How would I go about beginning the process of transitioning? As for now, just the blockers. And, uh. yeah. A year feels like a really long time from now. The long wait will certainly be disappointing, but I guess it‚Äôs the price to pay for getting what i actually want with myself. 
Another question: how expensive is all this stuff to do? We‚Äôre not exactly rich..

And next part; my mom used to read a bunch, so I‚Äôll see about getting her to read those books you recommend.

Finally, I thank you immensely for all this advice and help‚Ä¶ hopefully I can get to where I‚Äôm happier soon. Thank you. sincerely
Thanks. I know it‚Äôs never too late, I don‚Äôt know how to put it into words; I‚Äôm just miserable, it feels
Just searched it up, according to mayo clinic you have to be at least 16 to start taking oestrogen.
there's people that do take hrt before 16 in the states, I think it's just harder to get
that's odd because I keep seeing 19 year old on here that have been on hrt since before 16
It‚Äôs probably different for other countries"	uk0bb7	trans	25	0.93	2022-05-06 23:32:10
This‚Ä¶ is going to be long üòû	"I feel like I‚Äôve been posting a lot and I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just going through‚Ä¶ a lot. But imma give y‚Äôall the full rundown cause I‚Äôm so conflicted rn and I honestly just need support. And I‚Äôm sorry if this is rambly/all over the place. I‚Äôm high af rn üòÖü•¥

My parents are hurting me so so bad. And allow me to elaborate-I feel so gross and wrong. Ever since I came out, they‚Äôve been using feminine terms literally every chance they get. They deadname me constantly and only use my actual name as a sneer. I‚Äôm example, one of my friends sent me a package a few months ago and it had ‚ÄúLiam‚Äù on it, cause that‚Äôs my name, and I got home and when I got home and asked if a package came for me my dad said ‚Äúa package came for a *Liam* but no I didn‚Äôt see one for you‚Äù. A few weeks ago they cornered me in the living room and literally didn‚Äôt let me leave until they had told me that 1. God made me a woman 2. I have certain chromosomes and that makes my statement false and 3. Being trans isn‚Äôt even real. And they were actively weeping the whole time A little context: my mom is a doctor and my dad is a preacher‚Ä¶ not the best combo for a trans kid üòÖü•¥ and then they said that as long as I lived there, we would be having those conversations everyday. Fast forward a few weeks, I had told my sister I want to actually physically transition, and a few days later I had a really bad seizure and stopped breathing for a few minutes, and my sister called my mom cause she was scared and told my mom that I wanted to transition cause she didn‚Äôt know if I had started yet or if that would even have made a difference. So my sisters husband gave me CPR, and that was that, but when I got home, my parents sat me down, once again, but this time they were just angry. They said I had two weeks to get out of the house, because they weren‚Äôt going to ‚Äúsupport the destruction of Madeline‚Äù (that‚Äôs my dead name ü•¥). I got let go from my job like a month ago cause I had a seizure and my job was driving ambulances so obviously I couldn‚Äôt keep doing it, so I don‚Äôt have a job, I‚Äôm broke. And they‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ tossing me out like the fucking trash. (My CashApp is on my profile if anyone wants to/is able to contribute; but no obligation at all üòÇüò≠ü•∫) And then they changed the Wi-Fi password so it would be harder for me to be in contact with the people that support me being trans, cause the service at my house is indeed shitty as all get out. Fast forward a little bit to two days ago, my mom printed out a SEVENTEEN PAGE ARTICLE on how this one person transitioned and then regretted it so they detransitioned, it was literally written by this person, and the entire fucking thing was just ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe doctors let me do that to myself‚Äù ‚Äúthe people who supported me doing that just supported the destruction of my life‚Äù and all that type of stuff, and at one point they even say ‚Äúthe people you see in these clinics are just boys and girls playing dress up‚Äù. I- ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I cannot articulate how furious that made me. 1. This person is completely invalidating the ‚ú®entire‚ú® trans community 2. Okay. Cool. You‚Äôre not trans, go you, but I am‚Ä¶ like just cause this one mf backtracked a lil bit, doesn‚Äôt mean trans people just don‚Äôt exist and it‚Äôs all just a performance. So she gave me this article, and told me that we were going to have a conversation about it to make sure I actually read it. I was gone all day yesterday and most of today, cause I‚Äôm desperately trying to find somewhere to ya know, live. And as soon as I got back today my mom goes ‚Äúhow‚Äôd the hunt go?‚Äù And then looked at me and said ‚Äúyou know I bet ‚Äòone of your little people that support you so much and tell you want to do‚Äô may help you‚Äù. And not in a helpful kind way. It was sarcastic and demeaning. Anyways. She brought up the article and I told her the issues I had with it and why and I kept it level headed and for the most part she did as well besides the crying, but the things she said dude. She kept talking about how she loves *Madeline* and how she‚Äôs gonna miss *Madeline* and she was like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just like the girl that wrote that article!! You just hate yourself so much and you think this is going to fix everything‚Äù and then proceeded to list off medical stuff and then said ‚ÄúYou are never going to be a boy. You‚Äôre always just going to be a girl pretending to be one‚Äù and that‚Äôs when I was KO on that convo, mind you, all of these convos I‚Äôve mentioned all last ‚ú®hours‚ú®. But the thing is. I know they love me. And I know they care about me and want what‚Äôs best for me and they think they‚Äôre doing things that are conducive to that. But there this massive fight going on in my head where I‚Äôm mad at them for not even trying, when even my sister did and I did NOT expect that (she doesn‚Äôt use Liam but she uses nicknames to just avoid it cause she doesn‚Äôt want to actively hurt me). And I am massively hurt by the things they are doing and saying, and it‚Äôs putting me in a really bad headspace. But at the same time I still love them and care about them so much because they‚Äôre my family, and there are lots of good things about them as well. And I want to keep a relationship with them, but I can‚Äôt if this is all they‚Äôll ever do. They keep saying to me that my depression is getting worse since I came out because it‚Äôs ‚Äúdestructive‚Äù. Mf my depression is worse since I came out cause me being me is hurting people I love and I can‚Äôt do shit about it. I literally have to choose between me and them, and I am not good at all at picking myself like, ever. But I‚Äôm really trying to with this and it‚Äôs just so hard and it kills me to see them hurting because of me. I take care of people, it‚Äôs what I do, I wanna make people happy, and laugh, and smile. My goal every day is to be the best person I can be for myself and the people around me. My tiktok platform is based off of wanting to be there for people. All I ever try and be, is good. But it‚Äôs not good enough to make my parents happy, much less proud of me. I‚Äôm 23 years old (I lived in Utah, away from here and them from when I was 16-22 (16-18 was conversion therapy programs üëèüèª) I just came home last year cause I was going through a really bad break up and my mental health was really really bad) but I‚Äôm 23, I strive to be kind and help people, and I just feel like I‚Äôm a decent enough human to just‚Ä¶ try. Much less their own kid bruh. Literally I just want them to be proud of and love their son. But that‚Äôs never going to happen üòû idk what to do anymore. I‚Äôm exhausted and I‚Äôm at this crossroad where I really have to pick me or them, and I can‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs been on my mind more and more to just remove me from the equation all together. Cause it‚Äôs genuinely breaking me to be hurting people I love just by being me. This was really long and I‚Äôm really sorry I just feel massively alone right now and idk. Y‚Äôall got any advice? üòÇü•¥ anyways. You‚Äôre amazing and loved and beautiful and valid!

Oh god that's so fucked up. Marry rich, get outta there. Jk but for real I'm so sorry. That whole thing sounds so traumatic, I hope you're able to get out of there really soon. Make a GoFundMe if you're willing, I'd be happy to help advertise it on some Instagram pages
Oh my gods. Your parents are absolutely horrible people. I hope your mother loses her medical license because she is clearly not fit to practice, not treating you the way she is. I hope you find somewhere safe to stay. You are valid and your parents are idiots. I do not understand a doctor can be so incredibly transphobic. Best wishes. I too unfortunately can't give much advice other than get your parents arrested and cause them to lose custody of any siblings you have because they are not fit to parent whatsoever. There's other things they ain't fit to do but i'm not gonna tempt the reddit gods. Again, best wishes.
Liam fits you‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't have any advice, but god, your parents sound awful, no offense
I'm sorry, I can get to understand your feelings and situation with your parents. I had something of a similar situation, life gave me a little gift when they divorced, but yet, the trash talk never ends.

I know how the fear of loss is, but, is something that is natural, I would rather lose everyone than myself, I know there's more people out there, those who will support me and give me happiness, like this lil community, maybe we won't make a long time relationship, but just knowing that there's more for me out there that give me more from what I have in here is enough. 

If I could give you an advice, don't give a f about them, is not your job to make anyone happy, your happiness is first, and forever should. Because when you live for other people you let yourself aside, and as you may experienced, it isn't worth living. 

They may never understand you or try to accept you, but, is better if you live your life boy, because is yours, and yeah they are gonna hurt, but didn't they hurt you before?

Stay strong handsome üíô the pain is just for a moment, it will go away, I promise üíôüíô
Liam, ily (sincerely, like i love you) and as a fellow ""yOu'Re gOnnA rEGrEt iT"" child, i wish you good luck, euphoria, and to find a chosen family that can support you. i have no advice (except crowdfunding maybe) but i really really hope you're gonna be okay soon
Liam, I'm sorry that you're going through such a rough time. I wish I had an answer for you, let alone *the* answer. I hope you can find a way to get to a better situation, to being able to look after and look out for yourself.

They might be a doofus (narrator: ""Oh boy, AJ is definitely a doofus""), but you've got a long-distance, adoptive big sibling who wants you to be safe and wants you to be you!
Hey you‚Äôre not hurting anyone by being yourself. I can‚Äôt speak for your parents (they sound awful) but my mom used to put on an act to keep me under her thumb, it‚Äôs not real. As a 30yr old adult I can see it a lot clearer now.

It‚Äôs not love if they‚Äôre trying to control you. Love is letting your child grow into the person that makes them happy. I feel what you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs a hard truth to face, but you really don‚Äôt have to live another year pretending that their abuse is loving.

How to come out to boyfriend of almost 2 years that I found out recently I am trans FtM?	Yesterday I picked a bit at him and see how he would react to trans people. I gave him a scenario to which a girlfriend came out to a boyfriend as a trans man and he said he would absolutely freak out if that was him and feel like he was betrayed and would only be mad cause he would feel like something was being hidden from him. In reality thats not true I only recently found out and I've been crying daily about this being scared to lose him, but I feel even more sad that I can't present how I want or be called how I want. I moved in with him not long ago before I found this out what do I do? I feel hopeless	"Just tell him. Be up front that you are telling him as soon as you are able. If he can‚Äôt handle you being your true self then he doesn‚Äôt deserve you.
I came out to my partner about 6 weeks ago. And he goes through times where he feels like he was tricked. And he wasn't. I never would have been w him if I knew back 7 years ago that I was trans FtM. 

But the thing that really hurts him is that he's not the first person I told. It was 2 weeks from my ah hah moment to him finding out. Mostly he's upset that I told my bestie before him. 

So my advice, if its safe for you to do it, is just tell him. 

It's a hard thing to do. Good luck my dude. ü´Ç
Ngl he might‚Äôve gotten the hint when you gave him the scenario. Maybe you should sit down and discuss it, tell him, maybe explain that you just figured it out and you told him as soon as you were comfortable which is why you asked. You don‚Äôt mean to ‚Äòbetray him‚Äô. I‚Äôd hope he takes it good if you‚Äôve been together for 2 years he‚Äôll hopefully be able to continue to love you assuming you still love him. And give him some time to process if he needs, like leave him alone for just a little bit so he can process. Then hopefully he‚Äôll accept you and you‚Äôll stay together, he won‚Äôt feel betrayed. And remember that it‚Äôs better to tell him than to hide. Even if he isn‚Äôt accepting, then you‚Äôll know and you can find someone who does support you. Hopefully any of that helps- i didn‚Äôt proof read so hopefully everything makes sense
Ive had the same Situation even tho im not 100% sure and our relationship is now 6 Years.
Ive just told him. Its hard, for me it would be the End of it(not sure as i said) but we both agree on it that it wouldnt work.
In the End, do whatever you think will help you. With a Topic like this there isnt any possibillity to hide.
You can do it!
Just tell him. 
There can be only 3 responses:
He's a transphobe and you need to get rid of him.
He supports you but he is straight. You now have a good friend
He supports you and he's bi/pan and your relationship will rise through the sky 

I have the exactly same situation.
Now i borrow her clothes
From how he reacted to this fictional scenerio, it sounds like he might get violent
Look, if you don‚Äôt tell him, you will not be able to live your true life. You will be living a lie and be unhappy - especially that you now know, you will be even more unhappy. In the end, one day you will tell him, and the later it is the worse the outcome.

Also you are not doing him any favor by not telling him. I know, the thought of possibly losing him is awful but the alternative is worse. You have to choose between seemingly bad alternatives, but that is not true. By telling him you will be able to finally meeting your true self (at the *potential* price of losing him).

I had a similar situation (check out my posts with ‚ÄúMy story‚Äù) - and it (seemingly) took me 20 years to fully understand what was going on - but, the day I fully realized was the day everything changed and my wife and I both agree: every additional day of not telling her would have been lost ‚Äúlife-time‚Äù (quality of life)‚Ä¶"	vcz744	trans	27	0.93	2022-06-15 17:00:36
I just need to scream into the void for a second.	Hope you don't mind. It's been a really rough last few days. I'm on the verge of tears almost constantly. I feel ugly and depressed. I know this will pass. I know it will get better. I came out 9 months ago and this is my first major depression since. I call that a win, but God damn. I'm sitting here because I can't face my wife. She loves me dearly and has my back. She is one of my favorite people and I love her madly. But I just... can't. I have too many ing around. I'm only posting here because I'm fairly sure no one I know irl knows who I am on reddit. I want to hold my kids. My youngest won't talk to me. He hasn't spoken to me since before I came out. My oldest is also trans and non binary. I love them both to pieces. My wife has been wonderful through all of this, but I can't just keep piling more on her. I feel like a burden. My therapist bumped me up to once a well today. I'll meet with her again next Monday. I just feel raw. Venting has helped, believe it or not. This little post has taken half an hour to write. I'm a bit calmer now. If you read this far, thank you. üíú I'll be okay. I can do this. Back straight, chin up. Maybe tomorrow will be better.	"If you ever want to scream into the void and maybe have it respond back, feel free to DM me!
you got this!
Every day will be a little better. Be compassionate and patient with yourself. It does get better for everyone in the family.
Thank you!"	m0x895	trans	26	0.93	2021-03-09 03:03:23
(MTF) I got my hormones today :)))) heres the rollercoaster of emotions I went through even after getting misgendered a few times	"So I got my hormones today and like Ive had such a wild amount of emotions today so heres a bit of a rant and something funny that happened.  


Im 25 mtf short and skinny

So i started my day very excited and ready to pick my hormones up from my final doctors appointment and everything went really well with the doctor (shes trans friendly and lovely) and omg im soo happy its finally happening my dreams are coming true finally. I was on cloud 9 right after the doctor gave me the scripts for my Estrogen and T blockers.  


then I went to get the medicine from the pharmacy and i got misgendered a few times by this worker there which annoyed me and made me sad and like this lady kept misgendering me and idk it felt awful like i wanted to just like sink into the sand forever. Like I was wearing a skirt crop top and had a pink guess hand bag and wallet and like she kept calling me young man and using he/him, and im thinking uhmmm lady do u see what i look like??? and so yeah i was sad and annoyed for a while.  


 anyway 40 minutes later since thats how far the doctor was away from my house i decided to buy some alcohol  for a celebration drink. So i find the stuff that i usually get and keep in mind im presenting fem and when i go up to the counter the person who served me was a boomer who probably didnt know trans was a thing and has likely never met a trans person ever probs not even seen one lol. I would even say he probably hasnt even seen crossdressers based on his reaction.   


he asks for my id so i show him and he clearly thinks its fake even tho its my real id and he does the most extreme checks ive ever seen for anyone checking ids. Like it took him like 2 minutes of furiously checking the id before he was like fk it (like i used to work at a bar lol so i know what he was looking for) anyway checks it over and over so many times to see if its fake or not and then after his reality sinks in that the id is real he makes the most confused face ive ever seen.    


while i know i should be annoyed at him misgendering after being misgendered literally 40 mins ago. Like the face he mad was the most hilarious thing ive ever seen it  just made me burst out into laughter when i was sitting in my car reflecting on what just happened. As I was driving away i just saw him standing at the door of the building still with that confused look as he watched me drive off.   


  


(Just imagine this outfit without the anime top (and a random white croptop instead lol)  and without the wig lol) my hair is long now xD 

[https://imgur.com/a/imXtxU3](https://imgur.com/a/imXtxU3)  
(im the one in the middle btws) this was taken when i went to a drag show when i was cosplaying with some friends from uni when i was in my little egg

  


  
so anyway thats my day a roller coaster of emotions, i just got home and took my first hormones just then :))

&#x200B;

TLDR: got my hormones from my doctor (YAAAS) then when i went to buy them i got misgendered a few times which made me annoyed/sad and depressed. then I went to buy alcohol to celebrate my hrt when the worker misgendered me  and furiously checked my id cause he thought it was fake and he made the most confused face ive ever seen it just made me laugh so much"	"Congrats on the HRT!  
I'm glad you found some amusement in the proceedings at the liquor store hehe that's generally how I react when people look at me weird or whatever...not sure what's wrong with me but if people seem confused or offended by how I look I nomnomnom that shit up and just have the biggest smirk on my face lol.  
The pharmacy part was a bit more unfortunate and I'm sorry it made you feel bad...I feel like some people just need to do shit like that as not to shatter their brittle image of the world.  
In your position I would have said ""Thank you Miss/Mister"" if I was feeling sassy üòÅ I just misgender them right back lol and see what happens, just make sure you got what you need from them first. üòÜ  
Depends on the day though sometimes I don't have the energy.  


Either way congrats again on getting your hormones!!
omg tysm :))))) thanks for the kind words   


damn thats sassy omg   


sometimes i try to see the bighter side lol"	x2z041	trans	27	0.92	2022-09-01 05:12:59
Who else had a super awkward Father's Day?	"I was having a conversation with my little nephew about genetics and evolution because he was playing a dinosaur game where you can create your own breeds and whatnot. I honestly think we might have a tiny mad scientist on our hands based on his enthusiasm for trying to mix and match different animals in the real world lol

Anyway, up pipes my dad with ""You know once upon a time you had to talk about the birds and the bees but now it's the birds and the birds, and the bees and the bees, and the birds that were bees and the bees that claim they are birds even though they still have a stinger"" and you could tell he was expecting a big laugh and I just died inside.

So, how has y'all's Father's Day been going?"	"Yikes
I might have said something like ""Yeah, people can be more open and honest about themselves these days. ISN'T it great! üíô
Sorry to hear that.

My father's day went surprisingly amazing :) I sent a message to my dad and he replied ""Merci ma ch√©rie"" (""thanks my dear"" or ""thanks sweat heart"" for women in french) And it was the first time he gendered me correctly ! :D
Of all the people that were there, I'm only out to my partners and mom, so at least it wasn't a directed jab.

But I could tell my mom felt bad for me because she has spoken up in these situations with other people, but doesn't really stick her neck out around my dad.
Way to ruin a probably inaccurate dinosaur game
Disowned, so it's just another day for me
Didn‚Äôt have that kind of conversation but my mom did kinda call me out (luckily in private) about me possibly being on HRT which I lied and said no cause they‚Äòare both not really supportive and she claims it‚Äôll mess my body up
For context I've only recently come out (at 38) but my dad made sure to let me know today  that ""this is hard for [him]"" and there weren't any signs when I was a kid.
I had like.. 3 people bring my day down in isolated situations by congratulating me today. They were only wishing me well so I'm not mad at them or anything, but it sure does suck. They were all the awkward middle ground of friendly customer where I know them super well and know their order and show off my beautiful daughter to them, but \*not well enough\* that I feel comfortable correcting them. One super nice guy said Happy Father's Day, to which I gave a little half hearted smile while also sighing, and he just goes... \*happy, right?\* and tries to make sure I'm okay a couple more times until I reassure him it's fine.
Thats rough.... I had to distance myself from my family completely because of stuff like that. I hope you are doing alright emotionally
Yes a very mix feeling day as always.Just so hard so put into words the dysphoria anxiety caused my a word. Something you are that others expect and want you to be. But something you no longer want to be. Piece and love to all the ones dealing with these same thoughts and feelings.
I feel you.  No specific negative family interaction today ‚Äî but I‚Äôm closeted and it the day was off-putting.  Wanted to cry all day.

It will be better.  Hopefully you‚Äôll help him to see the World in a better way, eventually.
Well I got to, after 3 months of giving him the cold shoulder, explain to my ignorant father that no, just because I tell you I'm trans doesn't mean you have an open invitation to tell everyone you know about me too. You took my right to choose who and when I tell from me, and I will never fully forgive you for that. I will now resume having a thin relationship with you, but you have very few mistakes left until I cut you out completely.


And I you all are wondering why this wasn't the breaking point it's because I know he didn't do UT maliciously, just out of ignorance. I'm partly to blame as this is a pattern of behavior for him that I should have expected.

"I had this interaction today on Facebook. Mom isn't ""mad"" about receiving photos of her ""son"" wearing her dress and asked for advice.. I gave it. She didn't like it. Am I wrong in what I advised? She blocked me... (I'm purple, OP in black)"		"This parent is about to lose a child.
The OP had posted pictures of her ""son"" wearing the dress and had stressed that she wasn't mad about it. But said it's out of the blue and he'd always been ""one of the boys"" ...  she was more mad about him taking her clothing (or so she says).  She IMMEDIATELY blocked me after this interaction.
Unfortunate :/ I hope they wake up before they destroy their relationship with their child..  You are a good person for trying!
This is a parent that will get cut off. Oop.
Screw her
If she throws a tantrum with you for talking truth to her then let her go
I feel sorry for her kid though
How old is the ""child"" in question?  
Maybe I am missing a part of the story. Am I the only one thinking that it makes quite a bit of a difference if the child is five years old or fifteen or twenty-five? Tbh I would never ask someone very young if they want to be addressed with a different set of pronouns than they have used before for ""cross-dressing"" once.

I think the assumption that someone (even an adult) wants a different set of pronouns or is trans based on what they wear (in this case seemingly once) is faulty to begin with. Such a thing can only be decided by the person affected and should in my opinion not be suggested by parents or other well-meaning people.
Thank you.  Me too!
Her child was about 18, so an adult.  She had posted a picture of him however to protect them I did not repost.   The mother had also mentioned in other replies that she suspected he took her panties as well.  The assumption wasn't based on a whim.  It was based on her responses to others within that post as well.   Also, my comment encouraged her to speak to her son about it because you won't know unless you ask.  The immediate defense she took also indicates that is her concern.
Thank you for the quick answer and clarification!

I agree that it is fine to ask a young adult about their preferred pronouns and it is fine to suggest to someone to do that. However, I don't feel that the mother is required to ask because she catches her so far male presenting child wearing her clothes. There are a lot of adults who cross-dress without being trans for a variety of reasons. Maybe we are truly talking about a young man who feels comfortable enough in his masculinity to wear a dress and panties.

Of course, your interpretation of the situation and the mother's opinion is likely to be correct as you know more than anyone responding here. I can very well imagine that the conflict you foresaw will ultimately happen. Yet, I would disagree with your reply ""So don't go in with that attitude..."". There is no reason for you to pick a fight.   
Transsexuality is such a sensitive topic that requires a careful approach and ultimately this is between her and her child. No matter how much we wish to protect someone seemingly vulnerable, there is the very real possibility that we are making things worse and just ""hardening the fronts"" so to speak. The fact remains that we have no clue about the opinion and wishes of the young adult on the pictures.

The mother will know (even if she doesn't ask) when her child is ready to tell her. And I honestly hope, for both their sakes, that she will then be able to accept the answer.
I think you're absolutely right that it's really important to recognise just how jarring this can be for a parent and how foreign the concepts can be for a lot of people. Family members especially can have a lot tied up in the idea of a person as a certain category - it's what they've always known and it's the future they imagine for them, so I don't begrudge them having an initial reaction that a lot of us would consider inappropriate. Being gentle, understanding and compassionate has to apply to everyone related to transition not just the person going through it."	hk4169	trans	27	0.97	2020-07-02 19:51:27
So tired with the cliques and judgment in the trans community and the lgbt community as a whole	"I‚Äôm so tired of how these communities treat each other. There is always this is how things have to be done, or if you didn‚Äôt go through what I went through then your not real, or if you don‚Äôt feel how I feel your not real. I‚Äôm so tired of hearing about this. I‚Äôm so tired of how devided these communities are. We are supposed to look out for each other no matter what because francly no one else will.

We need to stop judging everyone... hearing people say stuff like, oh they aren‚Äôt a real trans person, they like to still dress in masculine cloths, and they don‚Äôt have bottom dysphoria, there not trans, is so fucking tiring and I‚Äôm not even someone that this criticism is against, and honestly it‚Äôs just as bad as what transphobic people say. Your trying to control someone, and put them in a little box that you think they should fit in, how is that any different then what transphobic people do? Why can‚Äôt we just be excepting of a trans brothers and sisters? We should be fighting other not are selfs.

It‚Äôs so annoying hearing someone say your hurting me as a trans person because you don‚Äôt want to do xyz. Instead of actually blaming the people that are making it hard for you, they aren‚Äôt in control of how the medical system looks at you, they aren‚Äôt in control of how other people look at you, and instead of trying to combat the people actually making it hard for you, they lash out at people that are just trying to be happy and live as themselves just like you are. 

Then you have the lgbt community as a whole, trying to judge who is the most marginalized, who faces the worst oppression, what does this actually server? Why are we trying to make an olympics of surfing out of this? Instead of being mad that a group doesn‚Äôt face the same or as much mistreatment why aren‚Äôt we just looking at each other and seeing the problems as things that we should all strive to fix? Why can‚Äôt we support everyone‚Äôs problems

Anothering thing.... why is there a right way to be gay straight lesbian, bi, asexual, and anything else, people that say you can‚Äôt be a lesbian if you date a trans person because they aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal woman‚Äù, explain to me how it is any different? The trans person is presenting as a female, they look female, they have female characteristics, just like the lesbian cis female, and that‚Äôs what they are attracted to. Why is this a problem? In what way should this be a problem? 

God I just hate it.... I hate it so much, we are supposed to be a community that looks out for each other but I stead we are a splintered group with different sub factions only looking out for there own interests. It‚Äôs funny really... this kind of mind set plays perfectly into anti-lgbt people‚Äôs hands. And we just let them get away with it. They blame a small group of people and say see they do it like this so you aren‚Äôt right or real, and instead of defending that group we attack it, saying hey your not doing it right, people see us as this, blah blah blah, instead of your know telling that person that we are all different have different needs and wants, but that doesn‚Äôt mean anyone else needs are any less.

I came in to this group looking for support and a place to belong, but all I found was another war zone, another place with judgment and proceved notions of how things should be. I‚Äôm disappointed.... wholely and completely. I‚Äôm sad at how fractured we are, how much strength we loss for being like this. I‚Äôm sad that the people that should be looking out for each other the most seem all to happy to stab one group in the back as long as it helps them. I‚Äôm sad that the same things we criticize people for we do are selves. I‚Äôm sad like a broken window then a solid community. I‚Äôm sad at how we turn each other away. I‚Äôm sad that we can‚Äôt seem to see it. And lastly I‚Äôm sad at how much this puts us all back."	"Well put.
I really haven't experienced what you're talking about here to be honest.

The people who say you can't be a lesbian if you date a trans woman and things like that are part of a different group that don't support trans people, the whole ""LGB drop the T"" assholes.

Unfortunately every community has its gatekeepers, its assholes and its ignorant and extremist members, it's not the fault of the specific community but rather of humanity as a whole in groups that everyone can join.

There is no way to establish a ""no assholes"" clause to the LGBT community unfortunately.
Damn, I‚Äôm still new here but I never noticed this. It‚Äôs really disappointing that this is how it is, the only criteria for being trans is being trans, and that goes for any other sexual, gender or romantic identity. With all the gatekeeping we face in other communities, you‚Äôd hope we wouldn‚Äôt gatekeep here...
There's so many colours in a spectrum, how can one colour be the right one.
When I was a young egg, someone told me ""There's no right or wrong way to be trans"". Best advice I ever got.   Live it and spread it.
Exactly what sub did this happen on? I have not noticed it.
Exactly...
This isn‚Äôt about any specific sub, or reddit group, this is about the lgbt community as a whole. If you haven‚Äôt been able to notice this happening then I highly recommend you look around. I‚Äôve been told multiple times that I was not a lesbian because I am not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù girl. I‚Äôve heard my trans girls who talk about how they are so mad with certain groups of people because they aren‚Äôt really trans because they don‚Äôt have bottom dysphoria, or so meny say ‚ÄúOh we have it a lot worse, they need to stop complaining‚Äù. I‚Äôve also seen the constant rivalry that seems to be going on between the MtF community and the FtM community. People saying they hate the others. People saying they aren‚Äôt real. I‚Äôve seen people exclude other from there ‚Äúgroup‚Äù because they don‚Äôt act how they are supposed to. It‚Äôs all over, please look around. Feeling of hate, distain and many more are all to common. Constant policing of thing people think should be a certain way. It‚Äôs sad... truely I‚Äôm sorry that this community doesn‚Äôt seem to understand how divided they actually are. How judgmental, and how critical they are of people that don‚Äôt think or act they way they want. Please look harder.... it‚Äôs there.... it‚Äôs all over.... opening are eyes to it is the only way we can start to stop this
Well, I came out in 1970. I've been on HRT for 32yrs and a hard core activist for 31. I'm MtF and I often attend meetings of FtM trans peeps and they love having me. I have lots of gay and lesbian friends. I attend trans support groups all over this and the surrounding States. I've been a member of or ran several trans organizations. I've given trans lectures to college students for decades and I have not noticed what you are talking about. Yet I'm sitting right in the middle of it all the time. Either I'm not seeing the trees through the forest or the problem is elsewhere. I have no connection to this hate from our community members you are feeling. I will need specifics instead of anecdotes if I am to help.
Ive said that ive seen and heard these exact things. Just because you haven't experienced them yourself doesn't mean they are there. It saddens me that it is there but it is. I just hope people will realize it and we can stop it....

An example that came to life recently"	lrhv1d	trans	28	0.93	2021-02-24 17:10:43
I finally told my parents that I consider myself a trans girl, but...	"Hi there! Nice to meet you all, this is my first post on this subreddit and I wanted to ask  you about your personal experience when your relatives finally knew about you being transgender.

I ask you this because yesterday night,I finally had the guts to tell my parents about this and how I've been having this feeling all my life. The thing is that my father was shocked at the beginning, but then he became angry and started yelling at me a lot of stuff like ""you are born as a male, you get a female and then you make a family, thats the correct thing to do because its normal"".

I mean... I was so dissapointed, my dad has been always so full of knowledge, so smart, I never thought he could have this kind of opinion. ""What did you expect me to do? To accept it? This is not normal, you are just being stupid and something int your mind is wrong, go get a therapist or something"", he said.

Good news, looks like my mother knew this since some years ago, I had a diary back then and it looks like she rode it before I got rid of it. She's supporting me on this, but now I'm afraid of my dad, I dont want him to get mad at me or my mom.

I don't know, I just wanna keep up with my career, get a job, start being more and more independent and then... I'll be who I really wanna be.

I could use an advice, btw. I really want to know what are your opinions about this since many of you have passed through this before.

Thanks for reading, and also for letting me join this community.

Love you all! <3"	"""Go get a therapist or something""

Yes, do. A gender therapist.
Love you! I'm glad you were able to come out at least
My dad kind of did the same. Originally, he was like, ""Okay, whatever. That's your own business, experiment and find out who you are, but don't take it too far,"" and I was like, ""?? Do you not understand what 'I'm a woman' means?""

And then he called me up out of the blue and told me I didn't know what I was talking about, that I needed to take it back, that I was destroying my family, and that if I transitioned, we couldn't have a relationship anymore. Needless to say, that shit hurt a lot. But I recognize that he's just lashing out because he doesn't know how to handle it. Parents typically go through the stages of grief when you come out to them because they think they're losing their child, so everything including denial, bargaining, anger, and depression are all things that are to be expected. But if they really truly love you, all they want is to see you happy, so the best thing you can do is live your best life and pursue your happiness despite any pushback from them.
Just want you to know that you are loved, valid, and incredibly brave for coming out!!! 

I totally get what you might be feeling rn - came out to my mother a month ago as non binary, and she's so sure that I'm going to come out as a trans guy when I've never felt male. Ever. Period. 

So yeah.....parents can suck. 

My dad didn't really react that much, mostly bc he doesn't even know what nb is....but it was better than my mom's reaction of: I support you but . . . (insert unsupportive comment here) 

But my friends were super supportive, even bought me an nb flag! So yeah, stick with the friends who will support you, and try to check out any trans or LGBTQ+ support groups. That really helped me! (There are some online, too!)  

And trans youtubers are helpful too. . . I'd recommend Stef Sanjati, Jackson Bird, Ash Hardell, and Jaime Raines. 

And keep in mind that your dad might come around, and if he doesn't, don't let that hurt your self-love! 

Again, you're valid, loved, and incredibly brave - hope you have a smooth and euphoric transition and happy Pride month!!!
Sounds like your dad has a fear response, I know it is hard not to take it personally, but there is something therapists call the ‚Äúwall of shame‚Äù and it is rooted in what I call ‚Äúpropagation propaganda‚Äù and the ‚Äúnormalcy fallacy‚Äù; the idea that we must all conform.

To answer your question on family responses, my mother was supportive of the idea but said something to the effect of ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt need all of those body modifications, right?‚Äù, my father left many years ago so he is irrelevant, my uncle kept saying something offensive about me removing a certain something and just honed in on that, my aunt said ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs your choice‚Äù and the most pivotal and difficult, however, was my wife‚Äôs response.

I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a partner that supports your likely eventual transition, I had not known partly because of age (I am in my mid thirties) and also due to growing up in a small town where LGBTQ was almost non-existent and mostly condemned and shamed, my only window into trans ness was unfortunately erotica. And so for whatever reason I had no idea I could actually be trans, and yes economics where key‚ÄîI was afraid of how I would support myself.

And so I moved in with grandparents, suffered in silence for over 10 years and went to undergraduate and later law school. My financial independence was coincident with moving out with my wife, and I felt I could ‚Äúfix‚Äù myself by marrying a woman. A therapist had told me I was ‚Äúnot homosexual, and just needed to find a nice understanding woman‚Äù which helped drive this unrealistic expectation‚Äîhe was not a gender therapist; and yes, see a gender therapist but find one that helps you see yourself, not one that tells you what you are one way or another (at least my opinion).

I told my wife I had been sexually abused a child and was confused, but did not tell her I was trans‚Äîmostly because I felt this was simply not possible, partly due to botched and misguided therapists. And so we got married, and I eventually found a job as an attorney (I graduated after the 2008 mess and it was hard to find work) and almost right after marriage my wife became pregnant‚Äîshe really wanted it, and I was depressed and just gave in.

It is simultaneously the best and worst decision I have made; the best because I have a lovely son, but the worst because now I am stuck in a situation where my wife has made clear during a year of me dragging her to various gender and non gender therapists, that she is wholly uninterested in supporting any form of permanent transition, and even was for a while more interested in chastising me for my gender expression.

We are at a detente now, but that is because I have chosen purgatory, and I do not know where we will go from here. Our son has high needs so I prioritize that, but feel it is likely I will be in a closet until our eventual divorce. And of course a divorce and transition where my wife is (in her words) likely to fight me in court for sole custody would likely cause harm to my son.

I don‚Äôt want to villainize my wife, but I wish my situation on no one, and wish I could take a page from Cher and ‚Äúturn back time‚Äù...

A great resource I found very late was Susan‚Äôs place; it is a transgender message board, you should be able to find it on google.

Also feel free to DM me.

You are doing great and the world is becoming more open, but we are the avant garde; and it is always hardest to be at the forefront‚Äîrecognizing the tremendous sacrifices of those that came before of course, but also acknowledging how far there is to go from an acceptance of us that is it conditional or random, to one where being trans is merely another fact of life that causes consternation in no normal
Human at all.

Bless your journey, and I hope your dad comes around. Think of the stages of grief, he is ‚Äúlosing you‚Äù in his eyes, even though all that is occurring is that he is only now beginning to see his daughter blossom into the beautiful woman she was always meant to be.
I thought the same thing, actually. He thinks I'm crazy and weird. ""Not normal"".

It hurts me a lot to hear that from the man who raised me for 19 years.
And yeah, you're right. I want to do my transition as soon as I can.

Thanks for your comments, btw. <3
I love you both
Yeah, me too. I was too nervous on telling them, also because many of my friend already know this.
I was worried about what would my relatives think about me... ;-;
Thank you so much... I'll do that, I wont take back what I said, because I know I am a woman! Im happy to know that I have your support, thanks.  ;u;
 Yeah... about my dad... I've got a little update.

My mother just told me he said he's gonna leave our place, he started hating me and he doesn't want me near, but he knows my mother and my siblings are gonna support me, so he just wants to get out of here.

That hurts me a lot... he was always proud of me, he just wanted me to be a great man... I'll be a great person, a great woman, but not a man.
And Im also worried about my siblings, its not their fault, this is not fair for them.  ;-;
I'm crying right now after I finished reading your comment... first, I'm so sorry about the things you have to live, I just hope everything gets better soon.

And second, thank you for being so kind, idk what to say... I just hope you are right, I hope my father someday see me as his daughter.

I feel like Im losing him, and now that he's gonna leave our place because he doesnt want me near, even my siblings are losing him... I'm sure who I am and what I want, but I still feel guilty about this...
Can we continue our chat on dm? I would like to talk a bit more with you...
Everyone is the hero of their own story and believes they act with best intentions.

I am sure that in his mind he is helping you and that by not choosing the Cleaver life (1950‚Äôs style marriage) you are in genuine jeopardy.

But my tale might help show why for you this could be a literal living hell.

I talked to so many older trans women with unsupportive wives; it is heart breaking (Susan‚Äôs place is where I found them) and no good can come from pretending you are cisgender if you are not.

I found a great post, don‚Äôt have the link, but the gist is; 

You never have anyone say that you have to prove you are cisgender, but in the court of public option we are ‚Äúcisgender unless proven transgender‚Äù; however, if you look at scientific theory proof of something being true is not the way we do things;

We can prove things are not a duck, but ‚Äúduckness‚Äù is a construct shown by proving what is not a duck; I.e. theories are only valid until disproven‚Äîcan you disprove you are cisgender? Can you prove you are transgender?

Why is that even relevant‚Äîif you are pursuing a transgender path the odds are high that you are not cisgender and thus are in fact transgender.

And now you are simply on the path to living your life as the transgender individual that you were, are and will always be.
Yeah. I live with my best friends, my parents told me they would never see me as anything other than my birth gender, but friends ARE family for sure :)
I'm sorry you're hurting so badly right now. . . I can relate. Royally sucks, doesn't it? 

Try and stick to the people who support you. . . your mom, and your siblings, and your friends too. Remember, you don't have to be *anything* for him, except you - because that's the best you can be. 

Stay strong, and give him time - he may come around, and that's great, but if he doesn't, just remember that sometimes you've done all you can, and you need to do what's best for you. 

But I believe if he loves you - and as a parent, he definitely does - he'll want what's best for you, and he'll know that transitioning and living your life as the beautiful woman you are is what's best for you.. 

And yes, it's not your siblings' fault - but it's not *yours*, either - *capisci, amica?* 

Stay strong, girl - you can get through this. I promise you.
My wife used to say she felt like I had died, I do not know if this is what your father will go through, I hope not; it‚Äôs certainly an exercise in serious mutual empathy. Bless your heart, sorry for making you cry! I just am glad I can at least warn people now and hope they don‚Äôt make my mistakes...
Sure sorry if I am clumsy on her I am on a phone..
You girl are saying FACTS. <3
Friends are your family, and I really love them. <3
Thanks for your sweet comments ;u;
Im kinda feeling better now.
Thank you so much for your kind words... I'm actually trying to distract myself from this, its too stressful and I think I gotta relax to think things straight.

Also, thank you for reading my post and also for taking your time to cheer me up, it means so much, I would like to be your friend if you want... not just to talk about this, but also for keep in touch, maybe we could be great friends. ^^-^^
Dont worry, I'm in the same situation. Still getting used to using reddit. ^-^'
Good :3 you have us if anything <3
No problem, I enjoy helping other trans and non binary folks out! Yeah, I'd love to keep in touch on Reddit. I'm kinda new to being trans - figured it out and semi-came out a few months ago - and I'd think it be cool if we could talk, and not just about trans stuff, too.
Hi, MALG117. Jamescyrus32 here. Remember me? 
Anyway, just wanted to check in. How have things been going with your father, if you're comfortable sharing? If you're not, that's ok. If you are, keep in mind that you can talk to me.
Yeah! I remember you. :3

I've been doing well actually, I'm hiding my trans topics for now since that is an uncomfortable topic to my father. To calm him down, I had to tell him that I was gonna think about this a bit more before deciding something, he wants me to stay like this for the rest of my life.

What he doesn't know its that I'm still decided to do my transition in a few years, I just wanna keep going with my studies, get a good job and save enough money to get a house for myself, then... I gues I'll be able to do what I need to feel comfortable. It's just that it bothers me that I cant call myself a girl in front of my family, and my dad keeps trying to show me the ""good things of being a guy"".
Hi! Glad to hear that you're doing well, though not so glad to hear about what your father is saying. I know it can be tough to almost be shoved back into the closet - I was, and there's still a lot of tension between my mother and I. But I'm happy to hear that you've got a game plan for transitioning and building a life for yourself. I don't really know what I'm doing, and although I think top surgery and perhaps testosterone is in the future, the idea of surgery makes me a little bit squeamish (needless to say, I wouldn't be the best doctor). Anyway, I hope that your dad lets up a bit, and hang in there!"	h8byhq	trans	24	0.91	2020-06-13 17:41:02
True colors of your friends...	"TW: transphobia, swearing

So i wake up this morning, check my phone and see a trailer-vid abt apex legends' new season in which a new transgender legend appears. My ""friend"" texts me abt this saying ""I will never play the game again because of this"" so i called him out on his bullshit, and the guy just kept saying this shit abt how ""the gays are getting everywhere now"". I AM ALSO OUT(transfem) TO HIM, DESPITE BEING ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABT MY TRANSITION.
So now I'm real mad in the very morning and I lost a friend.
VERY COOL"	"Ugh. That‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm sorry.
I always wondered, why do people have a hard time differentiating gay people, trans people, and bi people? Even when I knew next to nothing about them, the difference was pretty obvious. Do you think it's because many of them unconciously lump all ""others"" into a monolithic group? I suppose that would just be one of several reasons.
Silver lining of the shitty situation is now you can stop wasting time on this person and find someone who is an awesome fit for your life.
I *had* a friend like that once. I dropped him. He would always say he wasn't homophobic or transphobic, ""the lie detector test determined that was a lie."" When Star Wars: The Bad Batch came out and we found out there was a girl clone he had a complete fit saying they were going to try to make her transgender, and he just went on and on about it in a completely negative way. Between that and his attitude towards me (AFAB not out yet) I was just done. I left an official looking transfer sheet for my Star Wars character and had an admin remove me as admin from the group and I blocked him. 

I had plenty of anxiety attacks taking him out of my life but it was worth it. Sometimes you have to get rid of negative people in your life.
Choose your friends wisely because today's friend may be tomorrow's enemy .
Thanks. I just need to hold on till next summer so i can get a job and start gaining my transition funds and maybe move away from my incredibly cnservative family. But i do have some good friends left, one of whom is bisexual :)
I think that they simply don't care abt the exact difference between us so they lump us together in one pile to decrease difference
True dat
I've known this guy for a WHILE, so it is kinda sad that he said all that
You got this!
Yeah, to make it simpler for them, I guess. People love simple, black and white. It's a good way to know if you're losing perspective of the real world and retreating into your own head when things begin to look black and white like that. It happens a lot with depression. If you aren't perfect, you're the worst. If someone does something bad, they're a villain. That sort of thing. It just seems to be the way the human mind wants to operate when left alone. It's a real shame."	y6zeou	trans	25	1.0	2022-10-18 06:52:32
Ally looking for guidance	"Recently found out that my younger half-sibling is FTM trans. He's 16 and both parents are religious and very unsupportive, restricting his communication with peers, access to internet, have put him into religious therapy, and get mad if anyone finds out. they live an hour away from me so I can't regularly check in. I'm trying to figure out how I can best support him without his parents catching wind and making things worse. 

If anyone has advice for things I could do to help it would be greatly appreciated. Would also appreciate if anyone had advice on good places to purchase a binder, what brands are good quality and discreet, preferably something easy to hide or pass off as a sports bra if it's found?

If y'all get posts like this a lot, sorry, but I want to make sure I'm safely doing right by my little brother. If there's an FAQ or anything I'd greatly appreciate a link to it."	"Hey this sounds really tricky! Honestly don‚Äôt know what to say except kudos to you for looking for ways to be supportive. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Make sure he knows you support him. Until he is of legal age his parents will be able to control his life too much. Depending on where you live, you might want to see if you could help him get emancipated. If he's interested in that, of course.
Only a bandaid of a fix but no one should be restricted from contacting someone they trust in a time of need, Walmart sells TracFone smart phones for 30-60 bucks,  Buy one or two for him to hide and use wifi just for ICE. Not the best advice but hopefully helpful!
gc2b has a racerback binder that could pass for a sports bra for his parents. I have only heard good things about them. 

https://www.gc2b.co/collections/racerbacks

I think that just reaching out to him and seeing if he can sometimes stay on weekends and maybe have some mens clothing at your house, so that he gets a break would be really helpful. Give him a little oasis where he can just be a man and not have the pressure of being trans on him. 

If you can't get him out, then just make sure you call him lots, maybe have once a week scheduled time so that you don't miss out on talking to him. If he can't access his friends he will need you.
if GC2B would be too conspicuous, the girlfriend collective has compression bras that act basically like binders, and are less likely to make parents suspicious

it might be a bit less dysphoria alleviating than a binder, but something that says ""girlfriend collective"" on the tag may be less likely to be confiscated"	tpw3h0	trans	25	1.0	2022-03-27 23:33:28
Hair tips for trans men, from a trans girl	"Hello trans community of reddit! I'm mtf but I feel like there could be some overlap of hairstyles for both sides of the spectrum.

For context, I found out I was trans sometime in late 2018, struggled with it internally for about a year, and came out in mid 2020. Parents were """"""""""""""""""""supportive """""""""""""""""""" and I kept my long-ish hair, I have a mental breakdown, they make me cut my hair,  and send me to Mexico with my dad for a few months. Since then I've grown my hair back to almost the length it was before. 
What I'm trying to say is that I have tried many different hairstyles over the years and I think I have enough knowledge about the topic since I had to ""boy-mode"" constantly around my parents. So here is my humble advice for trans men wanting to pass, but don't know what to do with their hair.

Obviously, the best thing you can do is cut your hair short, however a lot of trans people are under 18 and have very strict parents, you may not be able to cut your hair short. If this applies to you, I recommend that you first see how short you can get it without making your parents mad, then evaluate how long it is and we'll go from there. In the theoretical scenario of very strict, heteronormative, parents shoulder length is probably as far as you'll get, but don't worry! Nowadays men with long hair are more normalized, therefore there are options, one option is doing something like Harry Styles as in, swept back, slight pomp, and of to the side a bit. Or, nb icon, Loki (in other words slicked back). If you have the dedication, you could try to emulate Jimmy Page circa 1970 (in other words, lots of fluff, basically look up 70's men hairstyles and see what could work for you)

Now, if you have free reign to do whatever you want to with your hair, I have a few ideas that I think you should consider. For starters, even if it looks easy and short, some of the hairstyles I'm about to talk about requires long-ish hair are sorta hard to do. That being said the first one I recommend is something like Alex Turner circa 2012 (in other words, a rockabilly), or Elvis, If your feeling bold. Either way your gonna need a LOT of hair gel. If you're like me and don't like the shiny-ness that happens when you use hair gel, then I recommend something like Serj Tankian (from 2001-2017 works for super short),  or Jim Root of Slipknot, from 2008 to now, (before 2008 works for longer hair) however you may need a absurdly huge beard like Jim's to make it work, so keep that in mind. Another option is Kirk Hammett from circa 1996, granted, he has naturally curly hair, so keep that in mind. Another thing you could do is a middle part. If you have longer hair you could first sweep back your hair, then do a middle part, keep some hair dangling there on the side of your face if you want a Resident Evil Leon look, or tuck the sides behind your ear for a more ""smart"" look.

Finally, you could do what I did almost exclusively.
Sweep. Back. Your. Hair.
The simplest option out there, the easiest to do, and works for (almost) all hair types.
Granted if you have longer hair, it might look like a mullet so be wary of that.
If you're going to sweep it back, use gel or hairspray depending on how you want it to look.
As I said earlier, gel leaves your hair looking glossier, almost greasy, but it holds really well.
Hairspray on the other hand, is almost unnoticeable when not used excessively, but it can sometimes not be as good at keeping a specific shape as gel is, so there's that.

But then again what do I know? I'm just a trans girl.

Good luck and best wishes to all my trans brothers!"	"thank you for sharing.
Honestly the best thing I ever did after years of fighting with my hippy dippy long-hair parents about my hair was cutting it all off so I'd have no choice but to get it fixed at a salon.

all I wanted was a pixie cut and I would have to negotiate to get the shortest karen bob they would allow every time I got my hair cut just so they could prove they were right about how ugly I would look with short hair, but I looked amazing with a pixie cut and it pissed them off so bad.

Of course it's a lot easier for trans men to cut all their hair off than it is for trans women to grow theirs out."	th4114	trans	25	0.86	2022-03-18 15:31:54
How should I ask her out....I'm too shy, advice? (FtM & MtF)	"So I'm developing a mad ass crush on this gorgeous Transgirl, I'm a Transguy btw.

We've been out with friends together, and attended gender peer groups. After spending some more time with her and speaking on the phone for 3 hours one night...my lil heart is dead ü•∫
We both come from abusive backgrounds and very spiritually driven minds, enjoy a variety of worldwide foods! And of course geeky as hell.....also enjoy poetry.

I Was thinking of taking her out to my favorite Japanese  & Korean restaurant, it's not fancy....but the food is brilliant! And she's travelled a ton, so I feel like she'd really enjoy it. Or something more casual like going out for a hike and to a cafe? We both love hiking.


I also don't drive....she does, so I feel even more inclined to not do anything :(
How do I go about asking her out? I'm so not use to being the one to ask?! üòÖ I'm scared she'll say no and then it will remain weird between us. How do I drop hints that I like her? I believe she has dropped little hints, especially when I mentioned our small age difference and she got defensive saying it's hardly anything. (19 & 23) Plus has asked me to join her for tea countless times....and I've always fucked up by being nervous."	"Just be yourself and do it. She may be waiting on the same thing. Her asking you to tea should be the "" subtle hint"" she is sending that she would like to further the relationship.As far as the driving thing? I am pretty sure that she knows by now, you don't drive. Just relax. This is a new experience for both of youüíúüñ§üíú
You could mention the place you like and say I would love to go there with you. Take the chance you never know what tomorrow brings (that sounds cheesy I know but accurate) Also if she says no it's no big deal, still be friends and know that there will be other girls out there for you. üíì
Aww this is really cute. as For advice I‚Äôm not the best at that and I know being nervous And awkward can mess things up easily But just be yourself. Try and bring Up that there‚Äôs this Japanese place you really like whenever you‚Äôre talking about food and try and ask her then? Idk I‚Äôm not the best with dating or being social in general but I‚Äôm sure you have a good chance. She seems to like you if she‚Äôs dropping those hints. Good luck my friend.
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è it's nice to hear others opinions, she knows I do not drive due to health reasons...it's just super awkward üòÇ because I can't drive her anywhere.
Thank you üòä I will take that advice"	jeq0f9	trans	25	0.99	2020-10-20 13:59:06
My Parents	"I (Almost 14FtM)  came out a while ago to my parents, and my siblings. My siblings were awesome and using my pronouns and all that. My parents on the other hand were not good about it. They both said they accepted me but they never use my pronouns or even acknowledge the fact im trans, or they'll say some really transphobic stuff. For example, I was playing The Last Of Us Part 2 the other day and my dad was watching. One of the characters is trans FtM. His sister was talking about how she reacted when he came out to her and my dad said ""Great now they teach this stuff in video games"". Obviously, that made me mad so i packed up the game and left. And my mom has done her share of stuff too. One time, we went to the mall. We went into this store so i could buy some marble soda, and when we went to check, there was this trans guy helping us. He was really cool and we got our stuff. As my mom was paying she leaned over to me and said ""Look at how nice her hair looks"". Me and him were so confused as he had on a pin that had the trans flag and said He/Him on it. The cashier quickly corrected her and said ""Actually i use he/him pronouns"" and she gave the most hollow sorry ive ever heard. When we got to the car she was like ""Was that a lady in the store?"" and and my sister blew up. She then went on to say all this stuff how she was born a girl and we always be one. I hate them both for it."	"Enby here; I think that they need to figure out that not only is it rude to misgender people but also plain wrong and that it can and does hurt a lot of people to be misgendered and more then all I hope you start being validated in the safety of your home. I care about all people on this subreddit and many others. And I hope you get to embrace who you are. Cya dude
Yeah my parents are like that aswell, my mother disowned me and my father says me being a boy is like drying to be a green dinosaur
some people are stubborn, they‚Äôll accept it over time, in the mean time just try to talk to them about it, i‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôd be hard to keep this up if they knew how awful it is
My mom came to my hometown for thanksgiving and my sister told me that she was talking to my sisters about how you shouldn‚Äôt use she/her pronouns cuz I‚Äôm delusional and it will make my mental illness work I‚Äôve been trans since I was 10 now finally being able to do what I want with my body now that I‚Äôm 18 and she‚Äôs not taking it well
I'm an independent adult, but when I want to get a point across to my parents I start calling them by their first names. They're clearly uncomfortable, but if they try to push back I say ""calling someone what they want to be called is respectful, right? Glad we agree.""
Thanks alot

My shitty 4th of July weekend (slight RANT)	"My girlfriend and I are both MTF and she invited me to her hometown for the 4th of July weekend.  I was apprehensive about going, but we've been dating for a while and I thought it would be great to meet her parents and family.  Everything went well for the first day I was there, but it all went downhill extremely fast on the second day.  We (myself, her and her parents) went to her uncle‚Äôs house to celebrate their grandmother's birthday.  

First, my gf wanted a picture of us together and I heard her uncle say something under his breath about us but I'm not sure exactly what he said.  Then, we were all sitting at the table with the rest of their family eating ice cream, and my gf put her hand on my leg. Her uncle eventually saw it and said ""<GFsdeadname>, could you stop rubbing his (my) leg."" I felt so fucking mad I wanted to punch him in the face.  Before we sat down I was introduced to him by my girlfriend as her girlfriend. The only person in the family that knew I was trans for sure was her mom, and now this asshole calls me he in front of everyone there.  

Anyways, after he said that I just stood up and walked outside, trying to hide the tears but I couldn't stop crying.  I ended up cutting our trip short and getting the fuck out of there which may have been an overreaction on my part, but I was looking forward to meeting some of these people and we were made to feel unwelcome in his home.  That's pretty much it, but I wanted to share the story of my shitty weekend. : ("	"Hey I'm sorry you had such a shitty experience. Holidays can be so rough for trans people and the LGBT community in general because of stuff like this. It's so unfortunate that I get sick to my stomach thinking about attending a family event at my girlfriend's house. I hope you have a great rest of your week.  
I'm so sorry to hear that. I wonder if her mother may have mentioned it to the extended family to try and make sure something like this didn't happen? It sounds like her uncle is an asshole. 
It's good that you walked out and showed him that you won't just put up with his bullshit. That guy sounds like a gigantic prick and if I were you, I would avoid him like the plague the next time you go to visit your girlfriend's relatives. A person that insists on using a trans person's old name is just a bigot that will never understand what a trans person goes through. Remember that you're strong for having made it this far! I wish you a happy 4th of July!
Ugh =( 
I know it hurts. I deal with similar things with my dad. It always makes me feel better that my girlfriend uses my correct name and pronouns loudly and repeatedly when around my dad lol! She is a pronoun machine gun!

The most important thing to remember, and your greatest weapon to use against this type of adversity, is that nothing these people do can change who you are.  I like to giggle at how my dad seethes with anger while he thinks about the fact that no matter how much he wants to control me, I'm free to live my life exactly how I want.

My dad could call me ""he"" a thousand times, and I am still a ""she""."	4renl9	trans	25	0.96	2016-07-05 20:15:56

I had a person try to horribly sext chat with me on Reddit for the first time two days ago and it was FUNNY! Lol

They messaged like a goddamn bot and was upset when I called them a bot.

""Hi. Where u from? Wyd right now? What you wearing?""

They were trying **so hard** to get me to say anything sexy or clearly something that shows I'm angry or grossed out, and instead they got, ""shit I'm studying for my patho exam right now so I'm busy. Why you asking?""

Then they sent a very badly taken picture of their fully clothed legs, and got upset because I said they're a bot and just wanted to know why they ask this stuff to people. They said, ""I'm not a bot, I'm just looking for fun.""

They stopped after I explained how someone that's not a bot should be aware of tinder and pornhub then.

Am I wrong?	"(FtM,17) I try everything. I try everything for passing, and trying to smile in front of everyone so no one have to worry about me and everyone could just not be mad at me just because ""I'm crying for something useless"". I try telling my psychologist about my gender identity, but at the same time, I can't make a proper decision just because for my family. I'm scared of them, really scared. And when I try telling about my past and thoughts with specialists, they just simply say I'm a ""exagerated girl"" or ""just a girl who have envy with every male d1Ck (yes some specialist told me that)"".

I'm just tired.

I just want to give up, just because every adult/specialist around me doesn't help me, or they just give me thoughts so I can be scared.

Maybe they don't want me to transition. Maybe they just still want to keep ""that little innocent girl"" who I was.

Everytime I talk about this topic, they seem really annoyed or they just can't take me seriously by making me think I'm wrong.

I just want to be happy with myself, with my body, being able to look at the mirror and recognizing myself, looking myself and being happy and proud of my body.

All this time. I try to ignore and repress this dysphoria that is consuming and torturing my brain all the time. I can't keep doing this. But I think I have to, just because for them.

Maybe I'm wrong about me being trans."	"I wish I had time to write a longer comment right now, but I see you. I wish I could give you clarity, but your heart knows the truth about yourself.

Thank you for sharing your struggle. üíúüíú
Don't rush things.
Mental health specialists are not all the same, you have to find someone you click with.

You must focus on your path, your growth and your happiness.

Keep working on yourself, and remember that all things shall pass.

Hang in there, and love yourself.
Some professionals are really shit. And it gets worse depending on which part of the world you‚Äôre in. A lot of the times these professionals are stuck in their own beliefs and cannot see the world unbiasedly. So don‚Äôt blame yourself for their bigotry. Don‚Äôt blame yourself for the family you got. Because we don‚Äôt get to choose what family we‚Äôre born with. But we can choose our friends. 

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre wrong. But I think you may be rushing things. Don‚Äôt focus so much on transitioning your body. Focus on yourself and the journey of discovery about yourself and find contentment in the things you discover and when the time comes you‚Äôll come back to it. Right now, you know you feel like a man. Later on you may feel differently, or maybe you‚Äôll feel more gender fluid. I highly urge you to discover yourself. Life is a long journey and just gets shorter as you get older. Enjoy the journey. Relish in the exploration of who you are.
Passing? U don't need to passing. U only need Be Yourself with love about Yourself. Nothing is wrong about u.
This. I think we can get sucked into an sense of immediacy, especially when in situations that are uncomfortable, or in this case, toxic. 

I'm not going to tell you to just be thankful that you have the self awareness that you do at your age to be even asking these questions. It took me 33 years to deprogram the bigotry I was raised in enough to finally be able to see myself outside of the cis framework. I wish I could've seen myself as clearly as you do when I was younger! From what you're saying, it sounds like life is squeezing you pretty hard right now. But that squeeze is a sign that you are growing, and outgrowing the paradigms that have been forced upon you from all sides. 

You're doing great. Don't give up, life will get better in some ways, and worse in others. It's what life does.

Hope this helps."	xt7s80	trans	22	0.89	2022-10-01 22:14:32

Am I trans if i just want to be a woman?	"m, 17, bisexual here.

Basically - no BS. I just want to be a woman. I like women's clothes. I wanna have breasts. I wanna look pretty. I'd love to be treated like a woman by men, and I'd love to be pleasing men. I am not fussed with losing the junk down under, I'm cool with whatever, a vagina or a penis, might just keep it in case i need it later down the path (i.e. if i want to become a parent one day)

But *I guess* I can go the rest of my life as a man if I had to. I just would feel better and more able to live my life how i want to if i was a woman. I'm sorta getting to the point of understanding we really have no purpose in life, apart from biologically to be born, reproduce, then do whatever until we die (just my viewpoint as a nihilist) - whether or not I become trans will not matter at all in the end, because we all die one day. I just don't wanna end up in my forty's and feeling regret like: I should've transitioned when i was younger.

A quick story: I dug out the old xbox today and started up skyrim, created a new game cos its been ages since i played, and I wanted to choose to play as a woman, and spent a good 20 minutes tryna get my character looking how i wanted her (or in the games sense, myself) to look - and I usually always when I play games create or choose a character that looks the most like me ( for some sense of realism, idk? just something i do), but this time I wanted to play as a woman character.

another one: I went to some sort of a flea market / vintage market with my uncle and cousin today to pick out some vinyl records (my cousin is a pianist, my uncle is a DJ, and I'm an audiophile (music enthusiast) and am learning to DJ) - basically, I saw this vintage women's fur coat, which i thought looked really good, soft and comfy, at a different stall for pretty cheap. I was madly thinking of ways I could maybe buy it and sneak it in my bag but i didn't want to raise any eyebrows on the way back home. I think tomorrow I'm gonna catch a bus there and buy it, bring it home in a bigger bag - and wear it when I'm home alone. Only fear is my parents finding it in my room by any chance - trying to explain it to them. Also considered buying some high heel ankle boots that i found and really liked - that's gonna be 2000 times harder to explain if my parents find that.

Sorry for the long post, but if anyone can help me - you are greatly appreciated, thanks so much."	"That's pretty much the textbook definition of being Trans. Why do you think you might be cis? Really.

Trans and terrified doesn't equal cis.

Trans with doubts doesn't equal cis.

Read [The Null Hypothecis](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/) and [That Was Dysphoria?](http://freethoughtblogs.com/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) I think they'll both speak to you a lot.
You seem a likely candidate for a strong case of Being Trans. 
Yup, we got a terminal case of a trans woman here.

Jokes aside. Your case sounds exactly like mine. I started thinking about this when I was 13 or so. My case wasn't one of those intense stories we are used to read. I wanted to be a girl, but I wasn't doing anything to transition. I wasn't even informed about the issue back then (there was no internet) but I had this feeling if I had any chance to look like a girl, I'd take it.

Then internet and customizable RPGs came into existance. I was so hooked to a game called Ragnarok online... just because I could roleplay and be a girl. I even got married to a guy online. Basically my game and internet persona was screaming: I WANT TO BE A GIRL!

Then I realized. As I was growing up, I wasn't becoming as manlier as people expected. I loved to look myself into the mirror and catch a glimpse of femininity. Whenever I could, I wore girly clothes. And for the cherry on the top of the cake, I realized I was so aroused by the idea of having sex with a man AS A WOMAN, it drove me crazy. I even tried having sex with guys before transitioning just to check if I was 'only' gay, but nope. It didn't feel as good as I expected, and I realized it was because I wasn't feeling comfortable in my body.

All these things piled up until I was 32. And I realized I was living an empty life. I was pretending everything. The whole time. I stopped socializing and became a hermit and finally came out to myself.

This is my story and I think we have a lot in common. But you will have to find your answers by yourself. You are so lucky there are so many friendly online trans people, therapists and counselors out there. Dig into your soul and let it speak for itself. We'll be here for you :)

PS Here are my [pre transition](https://www.instagram.com/mamichomaru/) and [post transition](https://www.instagram.com/andrea.khuriel/) instagram accounts. Just look at my sad empty stare before transitioning.
Yeah you're probably trans. Cis people don't want to be any gender other than the one they are assigned and usually don't put as much thought into it as you have.
The best way to find out is to experiment.

If you're anything like me, what will likely happen is that as you spend more time in ""girl mode,"" the more that boy stuff starts to just... well, _bother_ you. And that uncomfortable feeling is what people are talking about when they're discussing gender dysphoria.
Great that you are that confident in yourself.  I would caution you on going fully MtF as it carries a big set of problems down the road.  If you are gender fluid or non-binary and pass as wither gender then that would be perfect.  Male privilege is a real thing and to give that up to deal with transgender prejudice your whole life because you just feel like it sounds a little too glib.

Talk it through with a therapist to be sure you are well informed of the decision you would be making.  This isn't like choosing between playing basketball or hockey for your winter sport.  There are real consequences here and you want to weigh them all before taking on a difficult path.
Yep pretty much, that is exactly it. 
It sounds pretty trans to me. We all just want to be the women we are, and be treated as such. 
You definitely sounds trans to me
Not only are you trans, but you're also a fine person with lots to offer. Thanks for existing. ‚ù§
bump
Wow that first article hit home haha. I almost transitioned a few years ago and chickened out because I thought I needed to prove it. Starting to transition here soon
That first article was right on the head, what I was looking to hear. I'm a very logical person and this really helped put my doubts at ease.
damn, you look like those beautiful Latino girls from pulp fiction (me likey)

thing is, i don't really feel this whole 'i feel trapped in my body' thing, or 'uncomfortable with my body' like many others here do. I just want to be a girl because (a) it looks like fun and (b) I want to be able to wear clothes which are considered 'girly' (dresses, skirts, boots, fur coats, women's jackets) without being judged because the gender of my clothes doesn't match me.
right, i see. so they dont just see themselves in a mirror and think fuck i hate being x gender, i am this gender instead - its more like theyve seen the other side and dont want to go back? still very confused about this.
Oh, I'm aware of the consequences, definitely. But you know as they say, no pain - no gain. I think the hardest thing altogether would be the whole coming out shit if i commit to this. Listening to the whole ""are you sure it isn't just confusion"" or ""you never acted like this when you were younger"" or ""how long have you felt like this"" generic talk blubber blubber interview - already had to deal with that when coming out bi, but this is a whole new level.

thing about the so called 'male privilege', correct me if I'm wrong or you have any useful info regarding this - the way I see it, where men are given more opportunity, there are other areas where women are given more of that - examples: in an emergency, women and children are given more priority over men. a woman can literally get paid for sex if they feel that reasonable, whereas men have to try hard to impress the ladies to get sex or pay an escort for it. Women can still rise to the ranks in the corporate world, if they try hard enough and if they don't want to work, they can just find a man who can support them - don't forget about natural western human behaviors: most men (when married) will treat their spouse like a queen, holding doors for them, pleasantly surprising them, and protecting them more than they care about their own life. Also it is illegal in most states and countries to pay a woman less than a man in the same position in a job, with workers unions which help combat the mean bosses who do such things.

I dont know if i am able to pass or not, part of wanting to be a woman - i want long hair, which I'm assuming is only possible with hormones? none of that fake shit - i want my own real long hair
Thanks aha, don't really know how to react to that, except saying thank you.
How wouldn't you be Trans? That's a better question. What parts about growing old as a man sound fantastic?
yup. i was about to start transition, still very unsecure and nervous, amd that first article nailed it for me.


the rest of her articles (both of those authors, really) are great!
Not exactly, but kind of. If you think about it, is there really a difference between the two situations you described? One is someone understanding up front that their assigned gender makes them uncomfortable, and the other is someone who has that same feeling but they didn't realize it or understand it at first until they spent time figuring themselves out.

Being trans is a spectrum. For some people, it's a source of intense despair and depression. But for others, it could be as small as an occasional, recurring little thought in the back of your mind as you look in the mirror that says ""*Sigh*, you know, I'd be happier as a girl. I just... I wish I looked cute and girly, not muscular and gross."" Both of those people are people feeling discomfort, even if that second one is only a 3 out of 100 on the severity scale.

Most of what you've probably heard before now is the very stereotypical trans narrative on the extreme end: people who've known their entire life that something is wrong, they feel ""born in the wrong body"" and dread looking in the mirror and hate their genitals, etc. While that certainly applies to some people out there, it's really just one particular set of experiences.

That's why I recommend experimenting and trying to explore yourself. For example, if you start dressing up like a girl and then realize it's fun but you like being able to go back to being a boy at the end of the day, then it's probably that you just enjoy cross-dressing. On the other hand, you might spend some time presenting as female and realize you're much happier that way, and that every time you have to go back to ""boy mode"" it actually starts to bother you more over time and, hey, yeah you're definitely trans. Or maybe you'll figure out something else entirely; perhaps your feelings vary from day to day and you're actually genderfluid.

Try not to stress out too much. You don't have to figure everything out all at once right now. Take your time. Figure things out at your own pace.
Long hair is definitely not a hormonal thing - I actually cut my hair when I realised I was trans - it was down to my mid-back, no hormones required. (I have a cute short bob now~) 
Coming out will be easier since you already went through it with the bi issue.  I'm sure the other stuff will just be annoying more than anything.  

Men will still get picked for job more often than women competing for the same thing.  I think that is why you see so many trans women un/underemployed.  A man who 'couldn't hack it' and crossed over verses a true man for the position? The choice is unproveable but I can see it happening.  Especially with transphobia rampant.

My cis wife has been successful climbing the corporate ladder but she needs to work much harder to be taken seriously.  Being salaried does not have the backing of a union so she has been under paid the whole way!  Those positions always have a range of pay and are usually men at the top of the range and women at the bottom.  In the tech sector (I'm an engineer and teacher) it is very apparent.

People expect her to roll over when engaged in a conflict.  Then fight harder when they see she won't.  Some times when their ego is hurt they go after her by undermining her authority and call her assertiveness into question.

You sound like you have made your decision so just fortify it with as much as you can.  As for hair I waited too long and am balding.  So fake shit it is for me :(  Good luck and I wish you great success.  At 17 you still have a great chance of being very passable.
thanks for your immense help. this explains a lot and I sort of understand it now. I dont really have a problem with being a guy, but its not exactly where i wanna be.

Its like me saying ""I'm alright with working at mcdonalds , but I wish i had a more enjoyable job or something catered to the way i feel"" Its sorta like saying that. (for the record i don't work at McD's, I actually run my own computer business)
It would take me years to grow my hair to a point where it would be considered long
I'll vouch for shampoo with caffeine in it. I had to stop using it because it made my hair grow so fast I'd lose my style and have to get it cut much more often. I used the dove for men stuff with caffeine and menthol. I tend to like the smells of (some) men's soaps, but I'm sure there is a more feminine alternative out there somewhere. 
That's cool, I didn't know that could work. Do you know if there's any ways to grow breasts but without having to get a prescription or take hormones? I'm thinking of gradually making the switch, and just waiting for my parents to get used to it. If they confront me, I'll just say this is the way I feel like expressing myself, until I eventually pass."	5cli1f	trans	23	1.0	2016-11-12 17:50:52

Am i transgender?	"After all this time, i'm still questioning my gender identity. I'm currently 19 years old.

The first time i started questioning myself was 5 years ago, when i was 14. I didn't knew anything about being transgender/genderqueer or anything until i was 15. But i felt like there is something wrong with me. Then i found a random video on YouTube about a transgender man who talked about his transitioning. The whole thing just blow my mind and i felt like i finally knew who i'm. I did a lot of research about trans people, different identities, surgeries, hormone therapy and name changing. After all this i felt like o know what i want & i was so happy. So i thought i should came out to my best friend.

However when i /tried to/ came out to her, she said i'm too feminie to ever pass as a guy. This made me really depressed and broken. So for a whole year i give up on this whole gender identity thing. I tried to be more feminine & just be a regular teenager and try to get a boyfriend. However i just got more & more depressed so i give up on that too.

A year later when i was 16, i become really anxious about everything and i realized i can't just let this gender thing go. I tried to become more masculine and cut my hair shorter, wore male clothes and also tried to bind my chest down with the only things i had back in the day, bandages & sport bra's.

I felt so much happier but i still felt like something is wrong. In the same year, i met with a girl who later on become my first partner and girlfriend. She was lesbian so i thought maybe i should be more feminine, for her. Later on, i realized once again i was not happy like that so i just stopped it and tried to be even more masculine than before.

And an another year passed. I was 17 and my parents slowly noticed my changing and they were really mad. Mostly because my mother really disliked the relationship between me and my girlfriend. She thought i try to be more manly for her etc. I remember i once stole an unused underwear from my father who didn't mind it, but when my mother found it she was mad and went crazy on me saying things like ""you'll never have a dick get used to it"".

My girlfriend on the other hand asked me about this 'manly style of mine', and i don't remember how but i came out to her. She cried for weeks, and asked me to never go on hormones and stuff. Hovewer, months later she accepted me and said she will love me no matter what.

An another year passed, i was still unhappy but felt better than before because i felt like i was closer to accepting myself. I was 18 when my parents disowned, and kicked me out. They had enough of me & my girlfriend. So i moved to my gf & her mother.

I felt more free than before actually. I finally got my first real chest binder, i was able to cut my hair more shorter and i could buy my own clothes from the man's section.

So.. Now i'm 19, and another year passed. I got a job, and i live in an apartment with my girlfriend. I was also able to get a packer/STP what actually helps a lot. And for the first time, i actually visited a therapist to finally start my transitioning i've been waiting for.

But after all this time, i still have some doubts. I'm afraid i'm just faking it. I'm afraid i just ""want to be transgender"" so it would be easier for me to understand myself. I'm afraid it's just a phase. My psychologist said, that transitioning might be not the best idea because after that i might still be feeling depressed and empty.

I don't really like feminine things but sometimes i wear makeup & dresses at home just for fun. Maybe it will sound strange but i still don't feel like a woman when i do that. I rather feel like a drag queen maybe..? Also i'm really attracted to guys. I've never been attracted to girls that much. I just say i'm bi/pansexual. But i don't know anymore. So i don't know what's up with me anymore.. When i was smaller i always hang out with boys & i always dreamed about growing up to be a handsome man. I thought it was weird at the time, but i always imagined myself as a man when i grow up. Also there was a time when i asked my mother if she wanted to have a boy or a girl. She said she wanted a boy. And i said, ""well you can be happy because you got one"" and laught. I don't know where did that came from.. And there were other times when my family referred to me as a girl and i said 'but i'm not a girl'. 

I feel like it's weird but still.. What if i'm right? I'm afraid i will make a really bed decision with this.."	"If you live near a informed consent clinic I'd say go there. :) They have councilors that know how to figure us out.
From what you've said here, you are *really* obviously Trans. You're textbook. I honestly have no idea why you think you might be cis.

Dysphoria doesn't necessarily mean you're miserable or you hate your body or you can't stand the idea of living as a girl. For a lot of people it's a whole lot more subtle than that. ""I wouldn't mind staying a girl, but I'd rather be a guy"" is dysphoria. ""I wish I had dysphoria because then I could transition"" is dysphoria. [Cis girls would not rather be guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4hgcp8/cisgender_people_what_happens_when_you_question/). They actively *like* being girls. They aren't just settling for it because they're stuck with it. The point isn't that we're all miserable tortured souls who hate our bodies and want to die every time we're misgendered. If something different sounds like an improvement to you, that is a manifestation of dysphoria.

Remember that ""transition is scary and seems daunting"" is not why cis people don't want to transition.

Trans with doubts doesn't equal cis.

Trans and terrified doesn't equal cis.

Read [The Null Hypothecis](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/) and [That Was Dysphoria?](http://freethoughtblogs.com/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) I think they'll both speak to you a lot.

Forget doubting whether you should transition. Doubt whether you *shouldn't* transition. What if you regret not transitioning, or not transitioning sooner? (Spoiler: that's way more likely than regretting transition.) Take every scared ""what if"" question and change ""transition"" to ""not transition"". What if, by not transitioning, you screw up the rest of your life? What if you don't transition and you're never happy later in life? What if you don't transition and you regret it? If all those fears can be used against transition, they can equally be used in favor of it.

Don't angst about being 100% sure. You do NOT have to be 100% sure to act on your feelings, and there's loads of non-permanent things you can do. I'm guessing that you think if you come out as Trans you have to do ALL THE TRANSITION THINGS and there is NO GOING BACK and you have to be VERY VERY 110% SURE or else BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN and you will be MISERABLE FOREVER. None of this is true. Transition is a process, not an event. Just do whatever you need to do to feel as comfortable as possible in your own skin and in the world as you move through it. That's the entire point; the rest is noise. Transition is not a roller coaster you strap yourself onto. *You* are in charge. Try stuff out, keep what works, chuck what doesn't. That's really all there is to it. That doesn't mean you have to have surgery or live as a guy or anything else. If you want to be seen as a guy, put yourself into social situations as a guy, whether online or offline. If you want to try binding, try binding (safely!). If you want to try packing, try packing. If you want to try wearing jeans from the men's department, go get a pair of jeans. If you want this or that surgery, go for it. If you want to take T, take T. If you want to stop taking T later, stop taking them. If you want to go back *on* T later still, do that. Etc.

Therapy would do you a world of good. To find a therapist who gets Trans issues (most don't, and are unhelpful at best and actively harmful at worst), see http://t-vox.org/medical and http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/ . For the second link, enter your location and then select Transgender from the Issues list on the left.

Come hang out on /r/ftm. It'll help. (Yes, you ""qualify"". Yes, lots of people there feel like you do. Yes, I promise.)

Come chat in [Yay for Queers](http://ftmichael.transboys.info/yayforqueers.html) too if you want. I think you'd like it there. It's mostly Transmasculine folks and questioning people. It's not a bustling hive of constant chatter, but if you talk, people will respond and be happy to chat with you. :)
Obviously, nobody here can say with absolute certainty that you are or are not transgender, but what you've laid out very much suggests you are. Your psychologist is definitely not helping you; they are supposed to help you figure out whether you are or are not trans and what the best course of action would be from that conclusion, not merely saying ""X might be a bad idea because what if bla bla bla"". So yes, maybe you are not trans, but that should be something they help you explore and think about in depth, not just write off as though it's not worth the effort.

What really strikes me though is when you say ""I'm afraid I just want to be transgender so it would be easier for me to understand myself."" Pretty much by definition, if you find is so much easier to understand yourself when you think of yourself as trans, you ARE trans. If it gives you greater understanding of who you are then, prima facie, it's accurate. Nobody 'wants' to be transgender, as you yourself know it's vastly easier to act cis so that other people leave you alone, the only reason to act on the feelings of being trans is when they are really, truly powerful ones that are very strongly linked to your sense of self.

Now that all said, of course transitioning is a big thing to do, socially, emotionally, and physically. So it's understandable and reasonable to have some doubts, especially when society works so hard to tell us that being trans is wrong; but you should be getting support from a mental health professional who properly understands trans issues and knows how to discuss them in a reasonable and helpful manner.

Anyway, I hope you can figure yourself out and move forward with whatever steps you decide are best for you!!
If what you're written here is even half true, you are almost certainly trans. Your psychologist - like most - is a quack who is *actively harming you*.

I think you're trans, and transition is the only thing shown to make trans people happier and healthier."	7n49hm	trans	22	0.94	2017-12-30 21:39:15
I'm scared but...	"They will never stop us from existing. My fiance and I are already planning our move out of a red state to Portland and we are definitely going to be moving sooner rather than later now, but i'm starting to see a lot of people talking about how blue states wont matter once the GOP has control of the government again. I'm very scared about all these prospects but they can not erase us. They will not erase us.

POSSIBLE TW: TRANSPHOBIA My sister is misgendering and deadnaming me on purpose every day	I'm so done with her. She's doing all that transphobic stuff, when I correct her, she gets mad at me and yet, she still claims she's not transphobic at all. Should I misgender and call her male name until she'll finally stop doing that?	"try giving her the silent treatment until she corrects herself and stops gaslighting you when you bring up her transphobia. the only thing she has from u is ur attention.take that away and let her sort her feelings out
My parents do that every day. Very disrespectful in my opinion
Maybe talk to her about it and tell her exactly how you feel and how harmful it is to you. If all else fails, misgender her back lol
Ooo that's a good idea. Thank you!!!
Careful though, I have seen transphobic people beat their own friends and family for supporting the LGBTQ+ community. Y'all live together, so she can get to you and your possessions very easily, I would also put a lock on your door if you don't have one already, if you can that is. I have heard about parents disowning and abusing their own kids because they are trans, siblings do the same thing. Be careful out there fellow wanderer, and let us meet again in warmer spirits!

Sow yeah, the day went well. HOWEVER, I f*cking fell while coming back home, and ripped my tights... I only had two, and I can't afford new ones. Plus, it is impossible with how cold it is outside to not wear some...

I'm just WAY too mad at myself for not being more careful, I'm almost crying..."	"Hit up a craft store or a sewing store for an iron-on applique to go over the hole. Like a pretty flower or something. Just make sure you put some paper or something inside the tights when you iron it on, so you don't accidentally also attach it to the other side of the tights!

I mean, for sure it's a bummer to rip your tights, but maybe you can make it work *for* you.
I'll be honest, it's too bad of a rip to be fixed like that... Not saying it's a bad idea, it is great, but... Yeah, nah, I don't think that'll work... But I'll be fine.

Got my first 2/5 review on my book	"I'm not mad about it though. The reason the person gave 2/5 rating was, and I quote, ""I must warn you that the book contains a high of transgender and homosexual theme."" No, I did not typo that quote what-so-ever. That is exactly what they wrote in their review.
So, considering the other about 15 reviews on that site gave me 4's and 5's, I can live with daring to be transgender and writing about LGBT characters."	"The horror! The book included content I did not like, therefore maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have purchased the book in the first place, also I have learned that I have no heart and will be killing myself shortly.

Apparently since I'm a man I'm suddenly a violent person	"I already posted something similar to this on r/ftm but this one's a bit more of a vent. 

Basically, I'm a very calm person in general. I can easily keep my cool, and I dont think I've ever intentionally harmed someone since I was a petty little six year old who wanted his turn on the xbox. I go out of my way to avoid any kind of violence other than just friends hitting each other jokingly. Recently, one of my friends (A) claimed that a lot of our friend group was calling my partner 'bossy and controlling' (most of these people they barely even know) and I found out that she was lying for the most part. We got into a small argument over text that lasted about 10 messages tops and stopped talking for a while.

 Apparently A told the situation to her friend, likely with some exaggeration, and my partner later recieved a text from the friend they told (after asking the group if they really thought they were bossy) that said, and I quote, ""Saw your message I just think you could be a little nicer. And your boyfriend saying he's going to beat someone up is wrong"" of course, my partner was confused, and asked if I really said that (I did not) to which they responded ""Someone is scared he's going to beat someone up because hes mad at the person (A)."" My partner sent me a screenshot of the text and now I'm naturally confused. I've never met this friend in my life, and I think the most rude/worst thing I said during my entire argument with A was just ""yeah sorry but I don't believe you"".

I'm just annoyed because I know for a fact that if I was a girl, this assumption would have never come up and they probably would've just not cared. But because I'm a guy, they've decided to lie to my partner's face and say that I threatened to beat someone up over an argument that lasted five minutes, despite me not even implying anything close to that. It kind of infuriates me because I'm pretty sure I could get suspended if a teacher heard the lie, but even if I said something to anyone, she would probably face zero consequences for making stuff up that could potentially get me in a whole lot of trouble. Passing as a man is truly a blessing and a curse."	"It‚Äôs always hilarious to me whenever comments on this sub about the way men are perceived get downvoted. Like you do realize this is unfair treatment right? Assuming that any time a man is wronged or gets angry he‚Äôs going to commit domestic violence is ridiculous, if not outright insulting to the majority of men who wouldn‚Äôt do that shit. Obviously, many more men do it than women. But just because you and your spouse have an argument does not give anyone the right to levy false accusations of violence or threats of violence they know will be believed based on the gender of their partner. I get being afraid of violent men, but it‚Äôs absolutely stupid that people can see a man they‚Äôve known for years or at the very least know the character of and assume that because they‚Äôre a man they‚Äôre some stupid violent ape. Fucking disgusting misandry
Yea that sadly is a thing. That is part of beeing percieved as masc. On the plus side people will take you and your words more serious. These are effects of the patriarchy.
Yeah dump these 'friends' some or all of them are deliberately bullshitting to try and start drama, maybe they want you to be unhappy, maybe they want your partner to be single, maybe they're just bored. It doesn't really matter why they're doing this just that they clearly don't give a shit about you or your partner. If they didn't view you as a guy they'd just use some other lie.
You are correct, testosterone and I have never been a good mix as I was burning up, never hitting people but objects that couldn't fight back. Saying all this I have been officially classed as Autistic so that with T made me an angry panda. Now with T levels down, I am calmer, a lot. 
For you, euphoria as a man comes with baggages, anger is one of them.  Good luck though, you just have to work out how to manage it. If you do, let me know where I went wrong. I know there are some very peaceful men out there so it's possible.

Edit: My initial sentence didn't come across as I mean it to so I do apologise and it had been deleted.
Yeah I used 'friend' because it was the simplest term but I mostly stopped talking to A a while back, and probably wont at all after this.
This probably still doesn't read the way you intend it to. 

OP is saying, ""Now that I'm perceived as a man, people assume I'm a violent person, even though I've never done anything violent. I'm afraid that I will face consequences for things I didn't even do, because people will believe the stereotype that men are violent instead of listening to or believing me."" 

I suspect that you meant, ""I really struggled to control myself until I reduced my T levels,"" but this isn't the appropriate conversation in which to share that information. The contrast between what you've said and what OP said suggests that you actually believe that men are inherently violent, so people are probably right to think that OP is violent, too. In light of that, your comment sounds more like, ""Yep! Having a lot of testosterone in your system makes you inherently more violent! It takes a lot of work for anyone with masculine levels of T to be a calm, rational human being."" 

In other words, because of when/where you said this, it sounds like you're telling OP he should just expect to be treated as a violent person, because he probably is one, anyway. 

You also might want to know: For a lot of trans men, T is a mood stabilizer. The ""ragey"" symptoms only really appear when someone is taking way too much. Honestly, that's true for most men in general: Cis men are also typically only ""ragey"" if there's something wrong (ex, trauma) or their levels are way too high (ex, bodybuilder's ""roid rage""). Violence is not an inherent part of manhood.
Ah dam. Yes now I understand. Thanks for clarifying things. I did comment that not all men have this anger and did state there are kind men in the world. What I guess I should have said was testosterone gives an energy/edge that can push a man‚Äôs tolerance over the edge if there are other factors."	121bof6	trans	20	0.86	2023-03-25 05:17:37
God of war Ragnor√∂k portrayed something all trans parents should understand...	"First off, stop reading right now if you don't want God of War Ragnorok spoilers. Granted, they're not MASSIVE spoilers but a spoiler is still a spoiler.

Throughout the game, atreus goes on a mission to find out who Loki is. Throughout multiple chapters he goes from people calling him loki, to kratos and mimir calling him atreus, and so on and so forth and one time atreus calls himself loki and kratos blows up and says ""YOU ARE ATREUS!"". This causes him to run away for a full chapter and the next chapter is him running away and kratos doing everything to find his son.

TLDR, atreus eventually comes back and while everyone is mad at him for running away and talking to people he really shouldn't, kratos walks up to his son. His heads hung down in shame and kratos says nothing to him but 5 words.

""What do I call you?""

He didn't care if he chose loki, he didn't care what name was picked, He learned his son's happiness and his life was more important than what he(kratos) wanted. Afterwards, atreus runs up to hug his father as his father hugs him back... And though this entire time, I couldn't help but think that this was put in to show that parents, it doesn't matter what you want. It doesn't matter if you like your child's decisions, at the end of the day, that's your flesh and blood, and you should support them throughout whatever they go though. 

I nearly brought a tear to my eye when this scene came up cause this had to of been a message. I don't care if I'm overthinking. This was the sweetest thing I had ever seen before.

God or war was already a great game to show the bond of a father and a son, and now that atreus is a teenager in ragnor√∂k, he and his father have much more to learn and discover."		yuqrxk	trans	20	0.89	2022-11-14 06:15:53
I CAME OUT TO MY MOM!!!IT WENT WELL!!!!	She was (somewhat) understanding!  Apparently she was mad she hadn't been born a boy for a long time and basically talked like she might've transition out had our family been more accepting and I hadn't been born and she also said she might be bisexual?My uncle apparently also dealt with this and said he felt like a woman in a man's body for years. ( I think that goes a far way to show trans is genetic and natural but that's besides the point).Basically she said she dealt with the same stuff but doesn't understand why I would choose to go through the pain and discrimination.  I am disappointed about that and the fact she doesn't want me doing estrogen or anything permanent.She told me she's more upset with me being an atheist than trans and pansexual (lol). Anyways big stuff today! Now I'm just going to work with my supportive mom to get to my end goal. She's the only family member I think will support me but she's the only one I really care about, so nothing lost!!!	Good for you. I also have trans family members, mostly 1st and 2nd cousins but I think there is something to there being a family correlation.	qae1kr	trans	18	0.92	2021-10-18 03:07:23
Employers keep misgendering me	"So I work at the college I attend. It‚Äôs a nice job, doesn‚Äôt pay much but it‚Äôs only 5 minutes from all my classes and is very flexible around my schedule. It can also potentially get me into a career with the college after I graduate - like full benefits and good pay, and full tuition coverage for my spouse when they attend college there. Just wanted to preface this post with that, to say that quitting is not on my option list right now. I‚Äôm just looking for some advice and support.

I came out as trans/nonbinary (they/he) at the beginning of the fall semester, at school and work. (Not family yet.) So it‚Äôs been a few months. I live in a suuuuper conservative area, like you have no idea. So most people here seem like they‚Äôve never met a trans person before unless they are queer too. It‚Äôs been a bumpy road, but I have a professor & advisor who are supportive, and others who are actually putting in the work to learn and be supportive. I have close friends and a partner who have been with me every step of the way. 

That is, except for my bosses and coworkers.

I have 3 bosses - direct supervisor, regular supervisor, and the director over my department.  All of my coworkers are college students. They all got my name change almost immediately - there has only been one instance of deadnaming and there was an immediate correction for it. So that‚Äôs good. The problem is with misgendering at this point. I have only been gendered correctly once, maybe twice, since coming out. I wrote a note to the office a few weeks after coming out, reminding them of pronouns, but it was to no avail. The director and my direct supervisor saw the note first and had a private talk with me, basically saying I ‚Äúneed to be patient with them because it‚Äôs a difficult transition.‚Äù They also said they‚Äôd remind everyone in the office, but also said I need to get thicker skin because they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want to see me hurt.‚Äù 

Since that talk, the director has corrected herself after messing up a few times, but that‚Äôs about it. There‚Äôs been no progress with my direct supervisor or my coworkers. Whenever I hear them discuss me, they‚Äôre using she/her pronouns. When they‚Äôre talking to students about me on the phone or in person, she/her. One coworker called me ‚Äúgirlie‚Äù and then apologized hours later (but got really emotional about it and made me uncomfortable?) My direct  supervisor refers to everyone in the office as ‚Äúladies‚Äù in our group text. Some coworkers use ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù and have not stopped using it for me.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I‚Äôve tried talking to them about it, I‚Äôve answered the questions they sometimes have about it, I even wear a pronoun pin to school every day, hoping it will help (even though I‚Äôm worried about strangers seeing it and potentially attacking me‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how conservative of an area i‚Äôm in). I‚Äôm just so uncomfortable and I don‚Äôt know how to approach the situation. Every time I correct someone, they‚Äôll spend like 5 minutes on an elaborate apology and then never actually make the change. They just keep telling me to be patient. I‚Äôm sick of being patient. They‚Äôve only known me for a year. My partner (who I‚Äôve known for eight) has never once messed up my name or pronouns. I just don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs so hard for my coworkers - it hasn‚Äôt been very hard for the people who know me the most and the longest. 

I‚Äôm not even expecting much out of my coworkers. I‚Äôve never once gotten mad at them for it, even though I feel mad now. They just don‚Äôt try. It doesn‚Äôt help that since the talk my boss had with me, I feel like everyone perceives me as angry/hostile whenever I stand up for myself. Like I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúthick skin‚Äù or I‚Äôm being ‚Äúimpatient.‚Äù And then they wonder why I don‚Äôt make an effort to be friends with any of them. 

Idk. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated. I just don‚Äôt know what to do."	"I recommend you avoid confrontation about it. Just walk away when they start the apology nonsense, don't give them any more attention than is necessary for doing your job. You don't owe them anything.

The responsibility to change is on them and if they refuse to acknowledge you there's no reason for you to acknowledge them as anything more than some people who happen to work in the same place as you.
Buy an air horn and blare it every time they misgender you.
You have two options as best I can tell: try to ignore it and try to fix it.
If you want to do the former, just keep your head down, do the bare minimum your work requires of you, and try not to dwell on it too much. It‚Äôs hard and painful, but it‚Äôs definitely doable.
If you want to try to fix it, you have a couple options. First, I‚Äôm assuming that they‚Äôre genuinely still confused/learning and not maliciously misgendering you (even my very supportive parents took months to adjust, so it‚Äôs not unreasonable). If that‚Äôs the case, the best way to fix it is to remind them. Constantly. When they misgendered you, just politely say ‚Äújust a reminder, I use he/they pronouns now‚Äù. Don‚Äôt make a big deal out of it, and if they say ‚ÄúI know, it‚Äôs hard to adjust‚Äù just reply ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs hard, I was hoping that by reminding you I could make it easier‚Äù or something along those lines. Even better, find a way to constantly remind them - a pronoun pin or the like, if it‚Äôs safe
To be extremely blunt, if they refuse to gender you correctly, the best option is to quit. 
You tried everything you could and people refuse to gender you correctly. 
It's not your fault other people refuse to make the change (of gendering you correctly) as a way of respecting you. 
So, best option is to quit.
Put your damn foot down. They're taking advantage of your politeness and desire to avoid confrontation and I see this a lot. Unfortunately the most effective solution is to confront them head on, stop being polite, cut off any elaborate apologies and tell them off. Make it clear that they have run out of excuses, they are being disrespectful by misgendering you and you expect them to use masculine pronouns for you from here on in.

You do not need a thicker skin, they need to buck up their attitude and start taking these changes more seriously.
The issue is that with any job in the area I live, there‚Äôs going to be rampant misgendering, if not worse. If I take the misgendering at this current job out of the equation, it‚Äôs really the best I can get right now. It‚Äôs a desk job, simple data entry, with opportunities for advancement
I feel this something a lot of people who don‚Äôt live deep behind enemy lines in the red states don‚Äôt fully get. There are no viable options. It‚Äôs where you are that‚Äôs the problem. I had to leave a house I own, every friend I had, my business I‚Äôd been running for years and everything that wouldn‚Äôt fit in a suitcase behind just to gamble on starting a new life somewhere safe to transition. This is not a move most people feel comfortable doing especially later in life. Got those who don‚Äôt want to risk everything on a throw of the dice ‚Äújust quit‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work.
The plan for me and my partner right now is to move after they finish their degree. So, that‚Äôs still another 5 or 6 years because I need to finish mine first. The city we‚Äôre in is borderline rural, like 80-90% republican, and it seems every city event turns into a trump parade/rally. It‚Äôs densely religious, and the majority of residents here are a part of the same far-right-wing religion. But the university is good, has a really great program for what my partner wants to study, and is so so cheap - we can‚Äôt afford anything else without going into tons of debt. Both of our families are only a 3 hour drive away and I‚Äôm not totally ready to be farther away from them yet. I wish we could move right now, but it‚Äôs just not a viable option financially. I‚Äôm kind of between a rock and a hard place, and just need a way to stay sane and get through these next few years.
I feel your pain. Honestly the only advice I can give in those areas is to always remember it‚Äôs you, and not other‚Äôs opinions of you, that determines who you are. Even here in Hawaii, where people are more accepting of trans people than anywhere I‚Äôve ever been, I get misgendered a LOT. By basically every person I know who isn‚Äôt transgender. It happens, but I know who I am and that‚Äôs what matters."	s5wamy	trans	19	0.93	2022-01-17 05:42:44
Rant: do people really think we choose to be trans because it makes life easier? (CW: transphobia, sexism)	"I know quora is a horrible source for information but seeing as how it was the second thing that came up when I searched ""why are there more MTFs than FTMs"" I thought I'd check it out to see what people were saying. Oh man do I regret that. 

The top answer on there was from some guy claiming the primary reason more amabs choose to transition is because women have it ""so much easier in life"" I'll spare you the details of his horrible argument, if you really wanna know what he said you can look it up but he spewed the usual ""men's rights"" bs about work place injuries and how women don't need to put any effort into dating etc. And used this to explain why more people are MTF.

Not only does this ignore the fact that women DO NOT have it better than men in many areas of life (career opportunities, safety, getting respect, I could go on but you get the point) but it also completely disregards how hard it is to be trans in any society. We're the constant target of hostile legislation trying to strip our rights. We have the highest suicide rate of any group. Hate crimes against us are the norm. Many of us have lost jobs, friends and families because of who we are!

The idea that I CHOOSE to be like this is INSANE. I spend nearly every day in a constant state of misery because I can't just be myself without being rejected by society. If it was a choice to be trans it would've been one of the WORST decisions I ever made. If I could be happy as a cis man I would do that in a heart beat. But I'm not. This is not a choice I or anyone else made to gain a leg up in society BECAUSE IT DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE. 

I'm so mad that people think like this. Sorry for the rant but I'm obviously pretty upset and needed a place to share my thoughts after bawling my eyes out. 

Stay strong everyone üíúüíú"	"Yeah its pretty disgusting how people view our community. They either think we are mentally ill or seeking attention. They fail to realize we just want to live our lives like the rest of the worlds people. And it never fails to amaze me that sexism is so prevalent that people think MTF people transition for an easier time in life, its like really people do you not realize the target i just painted on my forehead.
I had the same reaction when I read something similar, I still remember that fateful day where I‚Äôm like am I really going to look up ‚Äúwhat is the ration of trans mtf vs ftm‚Äù but yeah, IDK if you want to talk about it feel free to dm me other than that, I get you.
Let's just read this bunch of stupid 

>There are more MTFs than FTMs today, because women‚Äôs lives are so much better than men‚Äôs lives.

Being trans is not a choice

>Women can chose a traditional gender role or a more equal gender role but regardless, men are still expected to be the primary breadwinners.

They can't always choose the more equal gender role and also some males are still gonna act like they're superior to women.

>Women lead entited lives of priviledge and men lead lives of servitude.

Are. You. Brain-dead?!

>A female can verbally or physically assault a male with little or no consequences, legally or otherwise but the converse is not true. If a male reports that he was verbal or physical assaulted by a female, rarely if ever, will he be taken seriously by the law or by society. He will instead be told to ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù and ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù. There are very few domestic shelters for males abused by females.

His conment is just a bunch of garbage text, but I think this is actually true and thus a problem.

>When men are single, our society requires men to have to deal with rejection to ask women out, but women are not required to do the same. Men have to be charming, funny, attractive, etc. and buy women drinks and meals and compete with other men, when they want women to go out with them. Women can just sit back and pick and chose which men they want to take them out. It is like a queen picking which slave will serve her

Sorry, that's how nature works sadly. Also, why don't you just NOT date? Problem solved.

>Men have to propose, risking rejection and/or embarrassment, and buy an expensive ring (the norm being 2 months of income).

Or you just DON'T get married. You don't HAVE to get married.

>98% of military casualties are men.

98% of the Military is men so that doesn't count.

>93% of prison inmates are men.

Doesn't that mean that men commit more crimes then women?

>Men then have to revert to the single life where he has to compete with other men to win the affection of a woman.

Or not. Why does nobody understand that being single is an option?
Just a thought, but there could be more MTFs due to the way sex is assigned. Common knowledge that everyone starts in a template similar to that of a girl when growing (in the womb).

So perhaps, since a woman is more likely to produce estrogen and such, so it means MTFs are more likely to be exposed to the hormone at a level and time that changes our brain chemistry or something? 

For FTM it would just be a lower chance as women naturally don't produce as much testosterone, so there's less chance of exposure at a certain time of development?

For non-binary folk? Honestly no clue, perhaps an eldritch being opened space and time and blessed them whilst in the womb. 

Just rambling thoughts. I'm sure scientists will figure it out eventually. It could be equal, and there's something in society that prevents the results from showing clearly.
Yup because who wants to give up the happenstance jackpot of being born with cis male white privilege in the US to be one of the most stigmatized minority groups in society today. Yup gave up a winning mega millions ticket for transphobia, dysphoria, sexism, attacks on job and housing opportunities,  a 42% suicide rate due to the amount of people who's family and friends abandon you, and get to spend years fighting with a for profit medical system that cares more about whether they can make a dollar off me than if they should cover my HRT. MAKES COMPLETE SENSE.
Sorry for the rant, that's some of the same logic my family had used to discredit me and my existence and it kind of gets under my skin."	mixp4b	trans	19	0.89	2021-04-03 00:39:09
I came out to my parents	"It hurts to write about, think about, just trying to think about it hurts like getting up right now from my cozy depression den and running 20 laps. I‚Äôm shocked, sometimes hurt, sometimes apathetic and free, sometimes feel like disappearing and then sometimes grounded. I feel so fractured about it. 

I write this post in hopes it give me a little therapy sharing my story and ironing out the details of my existence. 

My parents had been questioning me, in recent FB pictures I looked too good, too feminine. It was drawing eyes and and questions, my parents began to approach me jokingly saying that I have to be a man. That I have to be strong and manly, nagging me persistently that I can‚Äôt just be a girl. They say it lightheartedly but firmly, they can‚Äôt imagine that I their 21 year old could ever be that. Could ever do something as ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù as transitioning. Something that was only spoken of on media and television to an Asian conservative family like mine.

But one thing about me is that I‚Äôm a piss poor liar, and especially when questioned about one of the cornerstones of my existence. I caved and I could not get myself to agree to be manly, to not be a girl, saying yes would deny me. Hurt myself in a way that I can‚Äôt wait to heal, make painful memories I would regret in the present and future. Every fiber of my being would not let me hide myself, shut myself off when I‚Äôd been backing my true self into a corner all my life. I felt rejection from every infinitesimals corner of my heart, and so I told her. I told my mother that I am trans, a girl and I am happy this way, that this is all I‚Äôve ever wanted and more. I told her all of this under the condition that she didn‚Äôt tell my father.

People are liars and thats the only thing thats truth. My mother watched me, confess spill and cry while vehemently denying that I am a girl. That she birthed a boy with large strong bones. That I am her boy, that I am influenced, and mentally ill. She says she loves me and says out of concern that I should‚Äôve told her when I first had thoughts ages ago. She would have sent me to conversion therapy and still wants me to go. She thinks that I‚Äôm sick and can be cured, she doesn‚Äôt believe my doctors are good since they enforce my behavior and are okay with me getting on hormones soon. 

The worst part is, that she promised she wouldn‚Äôt tell my father and then she told him while on the phone with me‚Ä¶

She told me its okay because he was already questioning me anyway, that he wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone else

*spoilers* he did and he didnt even wait 20 minutes. 

He began yelling at me telling me he‚Äôs disappointed in me, that ive disappointed him. I‚Äôm crying screaming I don‚Äôt care what he thinks, he is stressed and goes to his brothers to vent. He goes to my grandmothers the next day and does the same thing. My entire conservative family thinks I‚Äôm selfish and horrible, because my dad is bipolar and I can‚Äôt be happy or myself because of the effect it would have on his mental health. And they also no doubt imagine i‚Äôm mentally ill from being related to him and brainwashed by privilege. 

They are so quick to blame people around me, blame the fact that they helped me move out to a condo while in school and being independent ruined me.  

The story isnt even over, not by a long shot but to wrap. My dad came back from my uncles, and I had come home because I wanted to see my mom in the flesh, I saw him and he yelled at my girlfriend saying that he would pull out of the lease, that he wanted me home at his house. Then he backpedaled saying that its my life and that he doesnt want to see me and doesnt want a girl in the house. He also thinks she brainwashed me and is mad that she didnt tell him when I first transitioned. 

Its been a heartache the past few days, I went to a concert to drown it out, but it always comes back. The sadness, the shame, being misunderstood, feeling wrong and wronged, like ai shouldn‚Äôt exist and its my job to fight for my own existence to explain to every hardhead who wants to change and confront me that I am organic and natural and it is simply who I am. I‚Äôm just a beat girl though who can barely force herself to eat meals on time, to lift the heavy blankets that cover my depression. The fight is dim in me y‚Äôall. Please give me strength. I just want to scream that I exist and am more than an accident. 

My heart oozes just to write this so I certainly won‚Äôt reread it, sorry for spelling errors."	"I know it hurts love, I'm not gonna bullshit and say I understand because I don't. My parents went to shit long before I had the chance to come out. You aren't alone in this though, you have a community of people that feel and think the same way, so if that's wrong to them then let it be wrong to them cause it's right to you and yours
You know who you are, you know what you want, and anyone who wants to drag you down is just an obstacle. Don't feel shameful for who you are, don't concern yourself with your family's petty concerns about image, and dont feel guilty about their selfish feelings. I know when you're still in a situation where you have to be around them it's hard to avoid these things, but don't lose hope that soon enough you won't have to deal with this nonsense anymore and you will be able to live your life as you see fit without their negativity.

Can someone tell me if this is normal for someone transitioning	Hello my little brother is transitioning currently (13) and seems to be very mad at me all the time? I‚Äôve been calling him by his pronouns since he told me them and I‚Äôve been calling him the right name but he still seems very unhappy we‚Äôre trying to get him top surgery but we‚Äôre very poor at the time and can‚Äôt do a lot for him, my mom refuses to let him take t until he‚Äôs 18 because she thinks he‚Äôll change his mind because he identifies as gay. She said since he‚Äôs only attracted to straight men that he must just be a straight girl (not to his face but still mean). I‚Äôm also a  feminist type of girl and I love talking about things that should be normalized/talked about more and I like to talk about female bodies (I also am bi and just think female body‚Äôs are so amazing and beautiful), butt he gets really mad at me and tells me that talking about other women‚Äôs bodies and my own make him dysphoric, I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs something every trans person goes through but it makes me feel really sad because I don‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable but at the same time why do I have to stop talking about my body? I‚Äôm not talking about his, can someone let me know if this is normal and if there‚Äôs anything I can do to make him less upset about everything.	"There have been times that being trans has put me in a trance of misery. I have no advice, just a: yeah, been there.
Dysphoria can put you in a spiral of misery that's really hard to get out of, that's probably what's going on right now.

Only advice I can give you is to just be there for him and show him you have his best interests in mind.
Him taking his anger out on you isnt fair but think of it this way: If your brother was a cis boy, would you feel so free to share the details of your body with him? Cis guys generally feel uncomfortable when girls talk about their bodies, particularly when it comes to periods. 

And I know you wont understand, but a trans person being reminded of the things they cant change about themselves feels awful. Every day we have to live with a body we dislike, and even something as small as seeing a woman can remind a trans man about what he dislikes about himself and feel uncomfortable. Of course its up to the trans person to not guilt others for their bodies. But that doesnt change the discomfort.

And at this point, this is about respect. Do you respect his feelings? If you know a certain topic makes him uncomfortable, why would you continue bringing up the topic? Its no different from any other topic. If a person has a fear of say, needles, and they ask a nurse to stop telling stories that involve needles, itd be pretty rude to continue talking about it.

Also, idk how old you are, but hes 13 and 13 is a literal child. Usually at about 13 is when kids start to realise that the world sucks and theres not much they can do about it and they feel angry that they cant make their own life choices. Compound that with the fact that hes trans and you have a recipe for a hormonal teen who not only gets stuck with purberty, but the WRONG puberty. Hes likely going through a rough time right now

On another note, most doctors actually wont allow a child under the age of 18 go on hrt without the parents explicit permission. Usually they will start a child on hormone blockers, which will stop his purberty from happening so that he has some more time, instead of being forced through the wrong puberty and then trying to undo all the damage afterwards. It sounds like your mom may not be supportive of him. But if you have the chance, or the ability, bring up hormone blockers to your brother and/or mom. It could really help him out a lot
Talking about female bodies probably reminds him of his own especially if the context insinuates that his body makes him more of a woman. Check if you're accidentally misgendering him that way. Also fuck your mother because it's easier to stop testosterone should he ""change his mind"" than him dealing with the regret of not being able to have an early transition. Seriously some people shouldn't be parents
Thank you so much I‚Äôll try not to talk about that kind of stuff in front of him
Would it be okay if i asked you something, and I Mean this as a genuine question. I live in denmark where the process is really quite long and you have to get checked up by doctor and therapists because of the health risks that can possibly happen, so my question is, is it safe for a 13 year old to start hrt? I do completely understand if you wish not to answer this question tho
I'm perfectly okay with the question and since I don't have any personal experience or knowledge of friends who've started that early, I did some digging. According to [an article I found](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/when-transgender-kids-transition-medical-risks-are-both-known-and-unknown/), you're typically not put on actual hormones till you're like 16. Before that, you get puberty blockers. They're safe and will prevent your body from going in a direction you don't want it to go.

dunno how reliable that source is but simply googling will say just about the same thing, and a friend of mine who was 15 had puberty blockers instead of hormones. If anybody has corrections or additions, they're appreciated

Just got back from my doctor. dont think he's gonna be much help	"So I made a doctors appointments to try to get help transitioning (mtf just now transitioning but wanted to for while and was scared). I went in knowing that it wasn't gonna go to well just because my doctor tends to refuse to treat things ""against his religion"" but since he's the only doctor that will take me at the moment had to go see him.

to be honest the appointment wasn't too bad got a referral to psychiatry (which is good since I got a lot of anxiety too and have had second thoughts about transitioning anyway) but what go me was when he said that transitioning is ""all the rage"" , ""a trend"" and ""that most people who transition think its a cure all and end up ruining their lives"" he also claimed it was a ""social experiment"" now looking online he's not the best doctor in town and most other doctors tend to dislike him he also usually sees the elderly and not a 20yo struggling with anxiety but at the same time if he's a doctor he probably shouldn't claim being trans is just a trend. the way he spoke to me was as if he doesn't like trans people but doesn't want to upset anyone though when he found out my sister had a girlfriend he was upset so who knows. 

in the end I might of got somewhere that can help me on my journey and honestly I'm not sure what to think of what just happened like I dont know if I'm mad at him or just happy I get to go talk to someone who can help me figure out more of who I am but I still wanted to share. not the worst experience but this is Canada"	"Find a new provider, that is unprofessional and like you said he has a bad wrap. Just sounds like transphobia tbh.
Find a doc that will actually help you, not make you feel worse. That's basic doctoring 101.
Find a new provider ASAP. A new doctor should be able to help you get your medical records transferred to their office. From what it sounds like, the one you saw will more than likely do everything they can to hinder you on your journey, wherever that leads.
Try out r/drwillpowers

They do telemedicine in most states here in the US.

I am very happy with their level of care.
the only issue is most other doctors wont be able to take me because apparently according to my mom he likes to hold medical records hostage and wont give them over. on the up side I dont have to go to him often for much.
I'm gonna try. I mean he's at least gonna get me to see a psychiatrist which might help a little with this journey or at least help with anxiety plus my family is super supportive (the important ones anyway) so they might be able to help me find a new doctor. I'm kind of new to being an adult lol
Try everything in your ability. You will never find the doctor that will help you out the most until you try! I'm sorry you ended up with such a situation. I truly hope it gets better!
If you're in the US you can request all your records from him and he has to comply. That is something HIPAA explicitly states. If he refuses then nail him for a HIPAA violation and he won't be working in the medical field anymore.

Reading YouTube comments of people defending the Arkansas bill is driving me mad	Why are people like this, what compels such cruelty?	"Just don't. Youtube is an absolute cesspool.
Fear and laziness. They're scared of what they don't understand and it's easier justify your own fear with hatred than it is to try and understand someone.
Making things better is going to take awhile. In the mean time, don't read the comments, never read the comments. No good comes from the comments.
I made it a personal policy to never read the comment section. It's simply not worth my mental and emotional energy.
Because YouTube enables it.  They let a nauseating amount of hate speech and misinformation on their site.
don't read those, people are just saying these things because A) they can, B) they're uneducated and probably immature, and C) they're anonymous. I'm betting most of these people would not dare to say something like that in real life.

Fear can be made into understanding.

It's really tiring and I don't have anyone to go to.

I often think of bro and dude being gender neutral so I still use and accept them. I totally get not liking them though while also not wanting to be the ""pronoun police"". Maybe start a conversation with a preface of understanding it's hard to change a habit and appreciating their effort. Then suggest instead of dude or bro some other terms you prefer.

Yeah just be up front is a better plan than seething. I‚Äôve known these men long enough to know when dude and bro are gendered (also they don‚Äôt call the other women those)

sorry this happened, if you have any siblings hopefully they aren't the way your dad is.
If you are located in the US, tell a teacher or an adult at school what happened. They can (and must) report this for you and help you document what‚Äôs going on. If you aren‚Äôt US based, try to look up the rules about child abuse and see if there are protections for you.
 I support you  I am 15 to reading  your story reminds of someone I knew I know if you are the US there is  shelters for the  LGBTQ youth now I am not sure in other countries  but I would tell someone about this and you have support on this page I know it's not the same as family support I now this may not help right now but there is a big world full of people like you  thats far away from your family that doesn't care. I know that it is hard but it does get better I promise you that   plus you can and need to get someone to step  if he hits  again I am right here with open arms if you need to talk your safety always is first
i can't call the police, my grandmother and my mom are COMFORTING him and no one seems to be giving a shit to me right now, apparently I'm in the wrong for trying to defend my identity... they would definitely make things up and mess with what I'll say to make it seem like my dad didn't do anything

unfortunately, I have no siblings either...
You know that parents sometimes just slap their kids and that‚Äôs amongst the more harmless stuff? The police doesn‚Äôt give a fuck. Sadly.

You are a minor. Try family counseling, or you wait until you are 18. Safety first.
you are a minor and your dad hit you, that's abuse and assault. Call the police
how so?

idk i literally can't properly talk to my dad anymore...
I definitely would do so if the situations were somehow in my favor, but this is most likely to harm my relationship with my family as a whole and not only that's something I don't want to do, I also don't want to lose contact and all with my younger cousins at all, so I don't think it's an option at the moment...

Past Four Years	"It started with a gun in my mouth, as 3 decades of heartbreak torment and abuse convinced me it was time to do this world a favor, and ejected the emptiness that haunted my bones out into void. My eyes were pitch black as they‚Äôve been my whole life because I knew they were always meant to offer nothing but darkness, how else could a mother look into them and say ‚Äòmonsters go to hell‚Äô. And as I stared into my reflection almost giddy with a twisted mix of revulsion yet conviction my  lips spread clumsily to articulate the only gift a creature like me could ever hope to offer, ‚Äòone less monster in this world.‚Äô 

But out from that black that has haunted my reflection my entire life, suddenly something flickered, and before I knew it that glint turned into a tear, as a voice I had long drowned in a life time of shame and alcohol managed to whisper a single word, ‚Äòplease‚Äô. And that word repeated, as more tears formed, and I realized that voice was my own the humanity I had long forgotten, if not completely purged by promised hellfire and sin that was inflicted on me since the moment I was born. Soon it tailed out of my mouth with strings of saliva ‚Äòplease,‚Äô each reiteration gaining more weight yet never demanding, ‚Äòplease,‚Äô it was a plea for pity, it pitied the creature before it, something no one has ever done before. Collapsing under the weight I with drew the gun from my mouth and unchambered the round and spoke for the first time to eyes that suddenly seem brown, earthy with potential and growth. ‚Äòplease, don‚Äôt, you matter, your worthy of love, your worthy of a soul.‚Äô And like that I started laughing hysterically as the words ‚Äòyou matter‚Äô rocked through me, my moment of hallelujah, overcome with madness I was still crying but they‚Äôd turn to tears of joy. I mattered, my happiness mattered, so simple, so stupid, and yet it took 32 years. So much lost time but it ended that day as I wiped my face from the mix of saliva snot and tears, and I got up and left to live my life for the very first time no longer as a monster, but a human being worthy of its innate soul.

My past four years started there, and while I lost some family, some friends and a job I loved, these past four years have been the best my life could hope for, that my life was always meant for. And while I‚Äôve spent it mostly healing myself and not moving forward with my transition (no hormones, no surgery, but I did legally change my name and gender, and live my life fully as the woman I am) but fixing the emotional damages that mar my brain, I feel like I‚Äôm finally in a good enough place to take on that challenge and own it like I‚Äôve owned these past four years. 

I know I‚Äôm long winded literally, because I could only speak in written word for most my life, so I‚Äôm sorry for that, but I wanted to share my beginning to remind all of you to never lose hope and always know you matter! Own it, rock it, make it your own, and jam your honesty down this crappy worlds throat, because you don‚Äôt owe them anything other than your absolute fiercest and boldest honesty and truth."

That was harrowing, painful to read, and beautiful.

I am glad that things turned around for you and wish you the best in what's to come.
I am speechless, you wrote this beautifully and it brought me to tears, you are so strong for what you have been through and I really relate to what you were going through. Im glad you are in a better place in life now. You should consider writing literature if thats not already something you do because you have a way with words..
Thanks, me too, I‚Äôm glad I wised up and stuck around. As horrible as it sounds it does help to know I wasn‚Äôt the only one. And yay! Congrats on your four years of being you!
Thank you for reading it, it‚Äôs been on my mind the past few days since I‚Äôve been on here and I needed to share it. Things certainly have turned around and I couldn‚Äôt be happier despite my dark history. I wish I had figured out a way to combine this with my pictures üòÖ pictures got like 200 views and this only like 7, but it‚Äôs out there, and I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve overcome to get here. Thank you for your comment and support.
Thank you so much! üòä I am touched that my story moved you. I‚Äôm only getting stronger, and indeed in a much better place. I had once dreamed of being an author, but eventually it got to much to even write, but I am coming back to it slowly, so who knows what the future holds.

I feel like no one around me takes me seriously and it drives me mad	"Fyi english isnt my first language. 

Just like the title, i feel like people around me, whom i came out to, dont take me seriously at all. I asked my sister and her boyfriend to call me by my chosen name, so many times. As much as i love her and shes wonderful support at times, she still deadnames me, but i figured it may be out of habit or something... But then i saw she has me saved on her phone as my deadname still. 

My mom refuses to call me by my chosen name, and still doubts that its not just body dysmorphia. For fucks sake ive been to my therapist with her several times, asking her to respect my name and call me that, still no. She even fucking said its a stupid name. I felt so hurt. 

Even my trusted teacher whom i really like, behaves really strangely in terms of my name and such, 'correcting' me to my deadname, until i legally change it with the headmaster. 


Whenever i come out to someone i get weird looks, because i wear very feminine makeup, clothes, long hair. I hate it. It feels like people think its just a trendy new thing for me. Not a constant feeling, not a struggle with social and top dysphoria, with accepting myself. 

Thats it. I just wanted to vent to some people who i think would understand."	"Honestly it might be how your approaching them. Are you demanding? Are they supporters of trans? If they don‚Äôt support it and they are older it takes time. Just kinda live in your world and focus on what you are doing and not how they perceive you.
Im as nice and as patient as i can be. Its been more than a year with my mom and my teacher, my sister knows even longer. Its hard to not focus on how they see me, when i live with them day to day...."	tvf59m	trans	16	0.85	2022-04-03 17:50:53
How do I get my trans son to bind safely?	"Very sorry if this is the wrong subreddit! 

My son is 16 years old. He came out to me when he was 14, and since I‚Äôve done my best to be supportive. We‚Äôve completely redone his wardrobe to be more masculine, moved him to a new school, got him into therapy, he‚Äôs now on testosterone, etc.

One of the first things we did was get him a binder. This seems to have worsened his chest dysphoria. He knows what it‚Äôs like to have a flattened chest, so he despises going without. He wears it every moment that he isn‚Äôt sleeping (and sometimes while he is) or showering, he wears it in gym class and while working out, and pretty much every time that you‚Äôre advised to not wear a binder. 

How the hell do I convince him to wear it safely? He hates his chest with a pretty burning passion (he once got incredibly mad at his mother for passing on her large chest through genetics). Would making him give it to me after he‚Äôs done school be cruel? If I did do that, how would I get him to take it off for gym class?"	"Has he tried trans tape? It is a little less effective, but it is safer for longer wear when worn properly, eg not wrapped all the way around his chest.
I second the people saying he is old enough to qualify for top surgery if that‚Äôs something he wants. One thing with excessive binding is that it can actually damage your chest and make top surgery harder for the surgeon
Give him a hoodie so that when he‚Äôs not binding he can still not have to worry about them.  Also he should be old enough for top surgery just so you know
Consider switching to [**TransTape**](https://transtape.life/pages/how-to-transtape). When worn correctly it doesn't compress the ribs or lungs, so it's safe to wear for days at a time. He can work out, swim, shower, and sleep in it.

TBH if I were 16 and was told to hand over my binder at the end of the day, yes I think that would be cruel. That would have been unbearable. And the prospect of taking it off in *gym class*, having those (in my experience) horrible repulsive life-destroying deformities flopping around publicly visible to *fucking everybody*, would have been completely intolerable. I would have stopped going to school before doing that. Hell I'd intentionally injure myself to get out of gym before doing that. 

I would have been indescribably horrified, disgusted, humiliated, and furious if my family insisted I go around with those horrible deformities visible in front of them. It would have made me deeply resent them and associate being with my family with indescribable humiliation and sheer visceral horror. And I think it would have left a deep, long lasting impact on my relationship with them.

Hell, what about top surgery? At 16 he may be able to get it now. And depending on what state you're in, insurance coverage may be possible.
i think he can layer clothes instead of binding, especially those ones you wear under your clothes if your shirt is a little transparent. i think they‚Äôre called camisoles, but they work incredibly well for binding‚Äîone or two would do the job along with any kind of bra really. some jackets also help with giving the body a more masculine shape, such as broadening the shoulders. i‚Äôve seen that with leather jackets; rain jackets; suit jackets; and sometimes those ‚Äúhigh school/college‚Äù jackets. those types of jackets work so well with the camisole method, and in general, jackets do give shape to the shoulders and hide the chest. however, the jacket should preferably not be a tight one. a good jacket would be one that is a zip-up or a button-up."	ulrdal	trans	18	0.95	2022-05-09 13:33:54
My first outing as myself!	"On Saturday I decided that I was fed up with waiting for lockdown to end, so I went on Facebook and bought a pair of sandals and a purse. My plan all week was to go out in public for the first time as a girl! I did a trial run under my baggy jeans while I picked up my items to test for any ‚Äúwardrobe malfunctions‚Äù that might give away the most obvious AMAB feature. 

On Sunday morning I did my makeup, drank as little fluids as possible to keep my bladder as empty as possible for the day, and just went for it. I was so excited to get out the door I forgot my phone! After returning to grab it I headed down the backstreets to head for a quiet trail to snap some pics in nature. 

After I was done that I headed for the pot store but lost my nerve to go for the door because my voice is not at all feminine. Walking down one of the busiest streets in my city now, I began noticing men looking at me! When I looked in their direction they would look away like they weren‚Äôt checking me out, but they don‚Äôt realize how damn obvious it is. That honestly boosted my confidence to astronomical heights, knowing that I pass so convincingly that I actually had men staring at me! Being told online that I‚Äôm beautiful is one thing, but being seen and checked out by guys in real life is a whole other rush of excitement that I wasn‚Äôt expecting.

It was a hot day and I was getting very thirsty, so I went to McDonalds to grab a small drink, which I didn‚Äôt even finish because I was so scared to have to pee at any point. I took the bus downtown and would usually go right to the back of the bus, or even stand if it was half packed in case any women or elderly folks need to sit in the front, but today I was that woman so I took a seat near the front of the bus and sat pretty while I played on my phone like any other girl like me does. 

Realizing that my mask and the drink straw messed up my lipstick, I got off the bus and went straight for the nearest window at the bus depot downtown to check myself out and reapply some lip gloss. Now the part of the city I was in before has almost zero pedestrian traffic, but downtown is full of pedestrians all the time. With my rear facing out towards the sidewalk as I was looking at my reflection I noticed this man slow down and change the direction he was walking to come and tell me ‚Äúnice pants‚Äù. I just grinned and got the f*ck out of there before any more men approached me. 

On my way to the Park I got a few honks because traffic is very slow downtown. I felt like everyone was looking at me at this point! Even women were looking at me but I didn‚Äôt notice until I got closer to the park where hundreds and hundreds of people were enjoying the sunshine and warm weather. I never had women just say hi out of nowhere to me, smile at me and wave just because... well, just because I guess! 

In boy mode I would stare at women and look for outfit ideas, but never too long because I never wanted to look like a pervert. But as a girl I could stare all day and when they noticed they all smiled back at me and even checked me out too! 

Then I had to pee. After knowing how well I pass I did not hesitate to go into the ladies washroom which was, to my surprise, ABSOLUTELY PACKED! I just stayed quiet, smiled, fixed my makeup in the mirror, and waited my turn. Two cute old ladies said ‚ÄúMiss, you can go ahead now. There‚Äôs a stall open.‚Äù Not a single girl in there looked at me funny! I fit right in! 

I began walking the whole park and enjoying myself. I felt so incredibly feminine and attractive! I began REALLY paying attention to the men at this point, men with their wives and kids were checking me out and they weren‚Äôt being smooth about it either. I felt so bad because I didn‚Äôt ask for this, their poor wives...

Leaving the park I realized that I got my first taste of ‚Äúsafety in numbers‚Äù. I began feeling very nervous walking back to the bus depot knowing that any man could just rape me if he wanted to. Or that if I coughed or sneezed people downtown would hear my male voice and begin harassing me. My city is not the most inclusive in Canada. There‚Äôs a lot of crime and drugs downtown. People get assaulted and robbed all the time. I could almost hear the insults like ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù and ‚Äútranny‚Äù coming my way if I let anybody find out I‚Äôm AMAB. 

At a crosswalk two vehicles rolled town their windows and the men waved at me and watched as I waited for my crossing signal. I just shyly waved and tried not to smile. One old man in a very expensive car singled with his hands ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to turn around‚Äù. I ignored it and kept walking. He met me at the next crosswalk and introduced himself to me. I didn‚Äôt want to get him mad by ignoring him or insulting him, so when he asked for my name I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Summer.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you a man?‚Äù He asked, visibly shocked by my voice.

Without bothering to confuse the situation I just said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù in hopes that he would leave me alone and he just chuckled and drove away. At the next crosswalk he actually came back and said ‚Äúbeing with someone like you has always been a fantasy of mine, I was wondering if I could have your number?‚Äù

Before I could respond I pointed at the traffic light to show him it turned green, and just walked away glad that it was over. But further down the street I saw him pulled over waiting for me! ‚ÄúSummer! I was wondering is you could suck my c*ck.‚Äù

I have a newfound appreciation for how brave women are yesterday. Girls who are a lot more attractive than me. I could only imagine the type of things they have to put up with on a daily basis. My opinion on men has changed forever. They‚Äôre awful creatures.

I took the bus to go makeup shopping because I was excited to show the girls at the drug store what I‚Äôve been doing with all the makeup they‚Äôve been helping me pick out over the last few weeks, but none of them were on shift yesterday and I had to chat with a new girl who had so much to ask me about my makeup and style. We had a girly talk at the counter for like 10 minutes because it wasn‚Äôt very busy at all. She complimented me and kept everything very professional despite her obvious curiosity about my life. With a big bag of makeup I began heading home.

Now my high school sweetheart works at the pot shop close to my home, I wanted to surprise her with my new look but she wasn‚Äôt on shift either. There was two guys working there. One calls me ‚Äúboss‚Äù and the other calls me ‚Äúbro‚Äù on a normal day, and when they pulled up my account they were shocked that ‚ÄúCaptain Kirk‚Äù from down the road was now a girl that they were checking out as I walked up!

I walked down the trail home and took more pics until my phone died. I got in the door and messaged my dad. Coming out to him and telling him all about my story, and showing him pictures from my day in the town. He was asleep and read them this morning, and good news! He‚Äôs super supportive and happy for me. Now all I need to do is come out publicly to my friends and then I‚Äôm fully out of the closet! Yayyy!!!

This coming month it will be my 27th birthday. I knew since I was 7 years old that my future was going to lead up to today. That would mark 20 years of hiding if I don‚Äôt come out to ever this month. It‚Äôs also Pride Month! My miserable life of hiding and being afraid is coming to an end soon. I have my family and that‚Äôs all that matters. I don‚Äôt care if I lose all of my friends now, I know I will attract better friends being myself.

Thank you for reading, and I love you!"	"That sounds like an amazing day minus the few things wish I could do that I know one day I‚Äôll be able too
Yay and congrats!!!  Sounds like you had a very wonderful first time out and that you passed very well! The freedom to be able to walk out the door as your true self is mind-blowingly (yes that‚Äôs a word, I just made it up üòä) euphoric. Good on you for your courage too.

Parents smh	"  


Basically, I wasn't supposed to come out. I'm 14 and I had a plan that I was going to come out to them once I'm out. Previously my mother decided to read me an article about how depressed teens claim they are transgender in order to feel better about them selves. I protested and layed out my own arguments to which my mother said, ‚Äúso you think you're a boy‚Äù. I shook my head and I said yes. She began telling me that I'm confused and that I was a strong young woman. Everytime I hear that I get upseat. When my father found out he got pretty mad and said I was trying to ruin his life and embarrass everyone. They told me I was selfish and ungrateful for trying to just be comfortable. I steal my fathers clothes because I can‚Äôt stand wearing the clothes I have to wear in order to be perceived as a girl. I'm not trying to piss them off or ruin their lives or anything. They keep telling me and mocking me about how I'll be a man with female genitalia and so on, how all or my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù friends will cut me off and I'll be human waste. It sucks since I'm not really able to do anything but positivity from others is always something that helps."	"You will be a better man than your dad is
I feel you ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ó I have the same thing
I know this wasn't easy so here is a hug from a dad and a I am proud of you son
Dude, your parents suck.
I think your parents may be bullies. I just have this gut feeling. They may also be six-year-olds. At least, emotionally speaking. Your mom even dodged your arguments by attacking your character (from her perspective).

I'm proud of you for standing against hatred and bigotry. You stood up for what you thought was right almost reflexively, without a thought of the danger. That deserves a medal, not ridicule. There isn't much that's more positively manly than honor and integrity.

I wish I could do something to help you. The System^TM and I have never been on great terms, so I don't have any advice there. I think it's disgusting how your parents are treating you. They deserve to be visited by three ghosts. Actually, ""A Gender Carol"" would make a rad little show.

She stood beside the silent, black-cloaked figure, her hands shaking. Rather than some mist-laden field filled with lonely monoliths that slowly forgot the dead, she stood in a bland hallway under the sterile brilliance of fluorescent lights. A nearby doorway opened with a creaking yawn, and from the room beyond came a terrible voice, strained, familiar. The figure beckoned her within. The graveyard, she realized, would have been a cold mercy.

""It's my birthday! I'm your mother! You have to come! It's the law!"" the old woman nearly shouted in an awkward combination of screeching and croaking. The phone she spoke into was turned up so high, her invisible guests couldn't help but overhear.

""You know I'd love to spend an hour getting yelled at again, but you know how upset your grandson gets when you call me your daughter. He doesn't deserve that."" the voice that responded was different. It was deeper, and even through the frustration, stronger. The woman looked to her hooded guide and nearly began to beg them to tell her this was all a bad dream, but they were as unmoving as a monument still.

""You are my daughter! You are! You've been filling his head-"" the old woman declared, her threadbare chair creaking, protesting her enraged outburst.

""Goodbye, mom."" the voice interrupted flatly before hanging up. The old woman huffed and fumed in her seat for a minute before her energy was spent.

""Goodbye."" she sighed quietly, defeated.

The younger woman, unseen and unheard by her miserable future, wept in terror and mourning. She clutched at the dark, cold robes of the silent guide.

""Not like this! Please! It can't be like this! I can't lose my baby this way! Let me go back! Please!"" she begged and sobbed under the empty gaze of the thing that had led her here. It's eyes were as if carved from stone. No compassion, no pity, nothing. Eternity was in those eyes. Eternity and pride.

Sorry, got distracted and wrote a short horror story. I do that sometimes. My point is that you're a cool dude with life ahead of you, and your parents need to choose of pride and fear are worth more to them than you. You can't make that choice for them, but I know what I would choose. Hugs to you! I hope things get better.
[deleted]
For what its worth I think you are an awesome dude. Your parents should be supportive but unfortunately they arent. Im hoping maybe reality hits them and they realize the weight of things rather than just being selfish jerks because thats what they are. Its tough for sure but please don‚Äôt lose hope.
Thank you!
<3
Thank you for all the support it really means a lot!
yup
yeah...I used to get kind of bad grades but then after I started working hard in school I realized the problem wasn't necessarily me but their expectations.
Thank you I have my future laid out and I'll fight for my happiness."	np3kk4	trans	17	0.91	2021-05-31 13:36:11
Am I overreacting to what my girlfriend said?	"Hey all, I need some perspective on things here, and I don't really have anyone to help, so I am hoping that the internet could help. 

A while back I got a new crop top, and I was really excited about it, did myself up in face app and everything and everything. I am the kind of girl to get really squealy and flit around like a pixie on cocaine when I get excited, so I wanted to show it off to my cis girlfriend. She was very specific that she only wanted to see a picture of the crop top. I was a little taken aback, but sent her a picture of the model in the top. I got to thinking about it, and I had a lot of doubt and anxiety about her response, so I asked her about it. I thought maybe it was a ""you are showing too much skin and this feels too exposed  for my level of comfort,"" but then she said that she thought that I would look weird in it because I am masculine presenting. I got hurt and mad and kind of left her on read for a while, but now I don't know if I was in my right for getting angry. Am I overreacting for getting angry over this?"	"I think you have a right to get mad, it‚Äôs just a nice piece of fabric you like to wear. If it makes you happy go for it, don‚Äôt let anyone interfere with your happiness
It's a perfectly fine reaction imho sis, just let her know how you felt so she can work on that, I also don't think she meant it THAT way necessarily and instead meant like ""top vibes"", but talking is the best solution here so there won't be misunderstandings/reprises
you have the right to be mad, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you shouldn‚Äôt take the high road. If you want, try talking through it with her, explain why it hurt your feelings in a non-accusatory tone (better if in person, text always had the tendency, imo, to feel passive aggressive) I hope you two can work this out!"	mvx1ym	trans	17	0.96	2021-04-22 04:14:17

Completely backed into a corner and it's not getting better.	"[Sorry for kinda long ramble]

I currently live with my parents and will be for the next year and a half. Over the past year my mum's emotionally blackmailed me into stopping any form of transition and I now have to live as someone I hate. I think I've held up fairly well for the past year but I think now I'm really starting to crack, especially with the stress from school. 

My mental health isn't critical right now. I'm not on the edge of a cliff, more just travelling down this straight path that's tilted downwards slightly. And I really can't see it getting any better between now and me leaving home in over a year.

I'm really starting to become worried about this and I'm really concerned that I'll end up snapping one day, either hurting myself, someone else, or breaking up my family. I don't want any of these things but I'm totally backed into a corner for the next year and a half. 

I don't know what to do. I can't change my situation at home and I can't change my underlying feelings about my gender.I just have to stew here, slowly going mad. 

Do you have any advice on what I should do, or ways that you've found to cope with these kinds of situations? Things that I can do to alleviate the pain or just block it out? 

Thanks for any replies. ~ Kim xx"	"r/transdiy 

Because fuck letting anyone corner you.
If you add up the years I was in denial and the years I was explicitly in the closet, it totals up to about 30 years.  Over that time I experienced an incredible amount of violence, both at home and at school.  But I'm still here, scars and all.  So you're not doomed, you just have to keep it together for the next year and a half.  Then you can move out, transition, and finally be your own person.

In the meantime, you have a few options.  For one, you can start practicing makeup and dress even if you're not on HRT.  You might have to be careful if your family is the snooping type, but worst-case scenario you can buy a lockbox and hide things in there.  You can also participate in support groups - online and off - and/or figure out your transition path for when you're ready to get started.  By taking control of your life to the degree that you're able, you'll feel less like you're slowly going downhill and more like you're climbing uphill with a few extra burdens.  Not ideal, but better than the alternative.

Oh, and for the record?  Fuck your mom.  Once you're financially independent you should seriously consider cutting all ties, at least for a little while.  She has to learn that being in your life is a privilege, not a right.
i kinda (sadly) know how you feel.


the only thing that worked for me was to get *so* incredibly involved in what i was doing i didn't have enough time to be anything else *besides* what i was doing.


i learned programming and electronics, learned how to play guitar, how to shoot a bow, constantly read books (usually fantasy or sci-fi) when not doing the above or studying, playing chess or playing soccer. it was an extremely trying time, and the only way i made it through was to be *entirely* wrapped up so tight in what i as doing i had no room for anything else... including watching tv or having friends.


this was pre-internet, though, and we lived in the middle of the woods in a town with around 20 people. my bus ride to school was 1.5 hours each way, and my nearest neighbor was about a mile down a dirt road. i ran away, once, and it took me 2 days to hike to a friend's house.


oh, my mother was a malignant narcissist dying of cancer, and had nearly complete control over *everything* in my life, save the thoughts i could think...and while i knew *something* wasn't right, and *if* you could have gotten an honest answer from me, i'd have told you i wanted to be born a girl...but this was the late 80's and i'd never even heard the word ‚Äùtranssexual‚Äù or ‚Äùtransgender‚Äù. life wasn't much fun back then :(


mainly, my focus was on getting to college as quickly as possible, and therefore *away* from home.


once i made it to college, things got better.

Yeah, it's just trying to keep it together that might be the hard part for me as I'm completely dependent on my parents.

My parents (somewhat) disowned me because of a musical.	"I haven't been on here for a while, sooooo much has happend since my last post. So for some context, I'm an 18 year old Trans-girl, my sister is 28 and a teacher. My sister had co-directed a musical for her school. It had songs from The Prom, Everyone's talking about Jamie and Dear Evan Hanson. My brother in-law thought it would be a good idea to invite my parents to open their minds.

During the show my mom was visibly annoyed. After the first act there was a break and my sister came to talk to us, my mom said that she couldn't believe that her school allowed her to show this to people, she went on about how disgusting that they showed a boy wearing heels and having two girls in love. My sister decided to take me backstage to get away from my mom. To my surprise my sister told most of the cast that I was trans and they all came and gave me hugs and called me by me femme name ( I tried really hard not to cry). When my sister and I got back to where my parents were, they weren't there, they'd left before the second act. I saw this coming and packed clothes, school supplies and basic necessities.

Later that night my sister and I received multiple messages from my mom, the usual gas-lighting, manipulating and treat tactics. Saying they were gonna take me out their will, give my stuff to charity, etc.

A week went by and I thought that I wouldn't ever see them again. I was living with my sister, I was getting school work done and thanks to my teachers I had several job opportunities. Living with my sister I was able to become more comfortable with being trans and started being able to see what the future might hold, I had hope. A week a whole week I didn't hear anything from my parents and then all of the sudden I get a message from my dad saying; ""I'm 10 minutes away, have all your things and come up alone"". I didn't want to go, I didn't know what they'd do to me or what they had planned but my brother said that I should go and see if I could talk to them.

I got in the car and there was just complete silence. When we got home, I couldn't take it, my mom said so much to hurt me and my sister and she was just going on like nothing happend, it made me so mad so I spoke up. There was the usual Bible arguments and conspiracy theories about how my sister was only supporting me so she'd become the favorite child. I t was a long back and fourth but I asked them Should the fact that I'm no-longer suicidal be enough, yes or no is it enough? They didn't answer. That was the end of the conversation.

I'm currently with my parents It's a little hard to deal with the occasional comments and my metal health isn't as good as it was but right now I've put pressure off my sister. I just have to try hold on a little longer to finish school. We have a family psychology thing some time at the Methodist church and I'm not too sure whats gonna come from that."	"Get out. You‚Äôre not safe with these people. I strongly advise you move back in with your sister and cut ties with your parents ASAP.
Your parents are fucking nuts. You're 18 which means legally you can do what you want. Move back in with your sister if she's cool with it. She seems super nice and supportive and your parents definitely aren't.
After reading all that it seems like you were happiest away from their household. I would move out if I were you, taking in all their hatred and derision won't help you
Get out if you can love, your sister loves you. Your parents are nuts and i don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre safe there.
You said you are 18.  Get on with your life.   Maybe your parents will grow up.   Maybe not.   Do you.   It's so great your sister and teachers are supportive.   Follow the love.
After reading all that it seems like you were happiest away from their household. I would move out if I were you, taking in all their hatred and derision won't help you
Try to move with your sister, I mean, you are 18 right? So you should be legally allowed to by yourself. On the other hand, try not to provoke them or talk at all while you stay there. Good luck!
Pack what you can and get out, they're most likely going to gaslight you about leaving so if you can do it in the nighttime. Get someone to drive you, get an Uber even, and go to your sister's. Delete their contacts from your phone and don't look back. Your parents would probably do anything to keep you in their grasp, and the longer you stay the easier that becomes. Best of luck to you
I understand why you stay. I understand why you go. 

I understand if you never look back. I understand if you yoyo back in forth.

You are a warrior in all cases and I am proud of you!
This. These are the type of parents who would happily pay for their kid to be kidnapped in the night and dragged to a conversion torture camp.

OP, get your legal documents, and get the fuck out of there.

dumb question about slang when talking to trans girls	this is dumb but its been giving me a lot of trouble lately. i use 'dude' and 'guys' a Lot when I'm talking, it's kind of the only way I let people know im talking to them bc I'm uncomfortable using names and it's a really good marker that I'm jumping topics. like I'll randomly be like dude.. youll never believe what happened the other day. It just feels wrong to start talking. But I know a lot of trans girls really don't like being adressed that way, and a lot of my friends are trans girls and I keep catching myself doing it and I feel Really bad but it's such a central part of the way I communicate (I've already got Mad communication issues) so I'm trying to figure out some kinda gender nuetral or even feminine replacement. Gurl is really not great for me but if nobody can think of anything else maybe I'll try it. For the record I'm also trans I get how this stuff can be and I really try not to use them at all it's just so central for me I'm having a really hard time with it. A replacement would be better than trying to rewire how I talk	"it comes down to preference. personally im ok with it but id by lying if i said it didnt bother me a little, particularly when people are excessive with it
‚ÄúYou‚Äù ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äù ‚Äúhey‚Äù there‚Äôs so many other words that can be used. ‚ÄúDude, what‚Äôs this‚Äù / ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs this‚Äù 
‚ÄúHey dudes‚Äù / ‚Äúhey y‚Äôall‚Äù
Not a fan of ""dude"" , but also don't care enough to say anything. I just sort cringe when I hear it. 

My suggestion as an alternative is to just drop it. Or if you absolutely must use an interjection as a ""place holder"" you can just use ""hey!""

I go with y'all or fam. Fam is my favorite because of my favorite slang phrase, go ham fam.
Being ""uncomfortable using names"" is a problem worth fixing, IMO.  If I say, ""Hi, I'm X,"" I've specifically indicated what I want to be called.  Who are you to just, blanket-statement, go, ""yeah, I'm not comfortable with that"" and decide not to use my name?

Sure, you won't use it non-stop, but don't let ""dude"" or any other placeholder become an excuse to avoid actually connecting with people specifically as themselves (trans or not).

Edit: added ""avoid""
I‚Äôm a translady.. I literally use ‚Äúdude‚Äù and ‚Äúguys‚Äù nearly every second. So it‚Äôs never bothered me because of the context.. 

It‚Äôs like cuss words dude, it‚Äôs a sentence enhancer
Technically they're gender neutral terms but they do have a bit of a male overtone. It's personal preference, I personally don't mind. Personally I would just talk as you normally do and then if they don't like it quickly apologise and move on. It's pretty much the same as someone called James saying please call me Jim.
Well it depends on the person like ask your friends what they would prefer. Thatll tell you all you need to know. For me personally it used to bother me a lot like cringey bad but well after learning some shocking stuff about myself I just ended up not really caring anymore so now its just whatever.
Hey, yo, a long ""sooooooo"", the work ""like"", there are tons of different ways to really communicate the same message. It feels weird now but if you stick to it you'll break the habit and it will feel weird if you try and go back to dude.
if someone uses dude generically it doesn't bother me in the least. I call other girls dude.
To get a group or someone's attention I might just ""yo""
y'all
You all / Y'all
I'm at the stage I'm cool with it.
I honestly can't imagine that changing.
I do it too!

Imo (no matter what) if you're unsure, ask!
If you feel uncomfortable, you can form new habits!
But it's nice that you care to ask and are aware.
.someone I talks to does it to me, and I don't even notice!
In my eyes, it's as gender neutral as you, but only as slang.
""Dude, come on guys, let's gooo!""

I know at least one girl who would lose her mind if I said that to her, so I don't. Lol.
""Greetings fellow bipedal mammals, would you care to commence a human conversation using our oral cavities and our funny flap muscles?"" 

If saying ""nah dude"" or ""hey guys what's up"" offends a person, they have far more serious emotional problems than you might be bargaining for. 

Case in point being almost every language other than English is either completely or partially gendered. Hey guys is no different than saying:

 ""Salutations, gender neutral amorphous beings.""

With the exception of ""hey guys"" sounding less uh...insane.
hey doesn't quite have the same like, directness? emotional intensity? intimacy? smth. But it's a good grammatical replacement I'll try. I try to go with y'all when I'm talking to more than one person. you kinda just feels rude. a lot of the time I'll say dude just to express that I'm emotional about something like. dude.... thats crazy. it's such a specific and versatile word lmao
This.
that's a good idea, I'll ask. I feel like they might not have a suggestion either but maybe they're fine with dude, and either way good to know for sure. i think probably not though i had one friend say they didn't like it and since then I think I can see some discomfort on other people's faces when I use it so I figured I would just try and drop it for safety"	qmp2b1	trans	18	1.0	2021-11-04 16:55:35
Am I trans?	"So friends are calling me trans, I was neglecting it, but I feel like I should ask someone about it. So I was assigned male at birth, and never really go by she/her or never really felt like I'm a woman or never thinking about transition.

&#x200B;

Despite this, for a long time I was trying to look and act as feminine as possible. I would never get mad at someone for not using he/him and I would often feel an euphoria if someone called me girl or girly. Often I am wishing that I was born in the opposite gender, despite doesn't feel like changing it. I would love to look as female and I would love to be born as female, but that's all. But I don't get mad if someone isn't treating me like one and I don't want to go to any operation."	"Only you can decide if you want to call yourself trans or not. Also, man or woman are not the only options, non-binary trans people exist too.
Gender is all about what you identify as. If you want to be referred to as one or the other, or even both, that's a valid option. I don't want to stick a label on you, but just know that what really makes someone trans is identifying as something that isn't their gender assigned at birth. Transitioning from one gender, to another. Either just changing pronouns or changing everything about their presentation from clothes to their hormones. 


If I were to choose a label that best fit you, I'd say gender non conforming. 

However. Keep exploring these feelings. Take your time and be honest with yourself. A lot of what you're saying you feel is very rarely considered by cosgender folks. I was where you're at a few months ago, now I'm getting HRT next Tuesday. 

At the end of the day, remember lables work for you, you don't work for labels, not that I'm saying I think you're putting yourself in a box and trying to fill it, just keep that in mind. Labels are there to assure you that you're not alone and that other people feel the same way you do. I hope this was helpful.
There are many paths these thoughts can go down, but you are what one would call an ‚Äúegg‚Äù. A person who very well might be trans, but has not yet fully come to terms with it one way or another. Wish you luck in figuring all this out

Dad found out about me changing my gender marking at school (Gender support plan)	"So yeah as the title says. Last year I went to my counselor and did the gender support plan in my district so my name and gender on my documents have changed (transcript, school files, etc.). He knew about me changing my name on there but today he just found out about my gender (I don‚Äôt know how he found out but I am feeling too dysphoric to ask). He told my mom and they told me they‚Äôre gonna contact my counselor to change it back to female. They are saying it‚Äôs going to affect when I apply for colleges because my transcript and whatever I put on the application don‚Äôt match and they‚Äôre saying I‚Äôll go into jail for identity theft. They say they‚Äôre looking out for me but to me they just sound really mad and I can‚Äôt help but cry since the gender support plan lets me escape from the dysphoria I feel from seeing my birth name and birth sex. 

I want to ask, does the gender support plan affect anything in the future or are my parents just making up stuff again."	"Sound like bs. Ask them to help change it legally everywhere
none of that is true, the only place that ever needs to see your deadname is where you're required to use your legal name for identification purposes. You can go by a chosen name everywhere you want to outside of that
I brought it up before in the past but they said it‚Äôs going to affect my insurance they put under my birth name and it‚Äôll be hard to change to fit my chosen name which sucks 
practically they say they support me but they seem to hate whatever I‚Äôm doing and don‚Äôt want me to change anything legally and they don‚Äôt seem they want me to go on HRT either (it even took them a long while to let me even cut my hair)
I‚Äôm sorry but they don‚Äôt support you. If they really were supporting you then they would be helping you change your name legally, and helping you change it across the board. Hopefully when you turn 18 you can file the paperwork with the state so you change everything. You can apply for college and always change everything once it‚Äôs legally changed. 

They are against Hrt, cut hair and official documents because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing here‚Äù they think this is a phase or can convince you out of it so they don‚Äôt want you do do anything permanent.
Oh so they're supportive, but god forbid you do anything trans related. Fuck that. They say they're supportive because they want to look/feel like good parents.
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm planning once I turn 18 

Yes I told them and they really seem to think this is ‚Äúa phase‚Äù and it‚Äôs weird because i‚Äôve shown clear signs when I was younger
Exactly, they don‚Äôt want to even go to my cousin‚Äôs house for family gatherings because they say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a hassle to hide this from them so let‚Äôs not go‚Äù and I hate it because I have a very good relationship with my cousins and don‚Äôt want that to go away"	y2o1yg	trans	17	1.0	2022-10-13 03:23:48
i need help	i recently came out to my family. My dad doesnt really mind but thinks its a phase. But my mum was really mad and confused, i had to explain to her what is the difference between gender and sexuality. when i did-she said im not normal and i need help. she also said that she cant see me as a woman and wont use my new name or pronouns. im trying my best to stay calm but i just cant stop thinking about it. does she hate me or she just doesnt respect me? I have had bad relations with her before so she probably hates me but im not sure. what do i do to keep myself safe. i would also appreciate it if i could get some tips on how to look at least gender-neutral. ty all <3	"My mom was the same when I first came out. Didn't accept it and believed I was this very different, almost creature in her opinion. It will hopefully get easier with time. She'll warm up to the idea slightly and not be as hateful about it. I kept the conversations with my mom in regards to be trans to a minimum to begin with. Its best to not overload your parents as they are ignorant to the topic bc its just becoming a widely discussed part of lgbt life.

Keep going about your normal life, don't let this change anything for you. Of your parents aren't going to beat on you ect, then by all means, just keep going about your life. Be smarter with money and save up a little extra each month, just to be on safe side so you have a little cushion if things go south.
in regards to being gender neutral, try go for darker wardrobe colors and keep it to sweat pants/joggers/black jeans and keep it tshirts and hoodies. i hope this helps and isn't too much over an overindulge haha. stay safe and awesome manüôÇ
In the end, does it matter which one it is? If she doesn't support you and refuses to learn, my recommendation would be to cut her out of your life ASAP. You don't deserve that kind of stressor forcing itself into your life, and as soon as you are fully independent (if you aren't already) you can just stop talking to her, there's nothing she can do about it. If she can't love and respect her child for who they are on the inside, she's not good enough to deserve talking to said child, and if that's too much to ask maybe she shouldn't have had a child in the first place. Try to teach her if you want/feel safe to do so, but if you do make sure you have some resources gathered and something written out if you want, so you can more quickly and easily respond to some questions/concerns.
thank you so much for the support. sadly im not fully independent yet and i cant cut her off of my life. i used to talk to her a lot more in the past but now that i came out and she doesnt support me i will try to cut connections with her as much as possible. 

when i told her that i want to go by my new name (veronica) she said that something is wrong with me and i cant become a woman, since then i got really sad and even started writing a diary where i can share my feelings because nobody else is there to help me. i tried to get a therapist but they didnt really help. one day later, she said that when people use my new name they are just making fun of me and will make fun of her one day (it cant be true right?) and this hurt so bad and since then i\`ve had suicidal thoughts but ig i will get better one day. 

thank you so much for the response!
Yeah, that's just her being a bigot. Imagine a man named Steve doesn't like his name, so he changes it to John, continuing to call him Steve is just disrespectful and rude. People using your preferred name are 99% of the time not making fun of you, I can't think of a single reason to do that. If they wanted to make fun of you, they would use your deadname/incorrect pronouns (like your mom), and they are nothing more than the loud minority. The vast majority of people, all around the world, have no issue with LGBTQIA+ people, and would probably use whatever name and pronouns you give them.

Be the authentic you, and don't let anyone take your identity from you. Keep safe and hidden if necessary, but don't let go of your true self.
you can become a girl, because, guess what? you already are a girl. no, people who are using your name are not making fun of you (or your mom). Your mom probably thinks that was because she is embarrassed or ashamed of you being a girl, which sucks /: I promise you people using your name are not making fun of you though. Your mom will figure it out, or if she doesn‚Äôt, you can make the decision on how to treat her. Journaling is a great coping skill so I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre able to at least express your feelings.

Supporting my trans teen?	"Hi y'all, I need some help finding the best way to support my 13 yr old ftm step-kid. A couple days ago they came to us (me and their dad) and let us know they identify as male and want to use they/him pronouns. Awesome! I consider myself a huge ally and totally support them in expressing themself. Their bio-parents are a little more hesitant, mostly about how young they are and it being more of a ""phase"", but overall are happy if it makes them happy. The only real problem is that in addition to being trans, our kid is a basic obnoxious, self-centered, righteous teenager that has nothing to do with gender or sexuality, but now that they have come out, they are walking around with a giant chip on their shoulder pre-emptively expecting people to be transphobic, it seems like. We live in a super liberal area, and honestly there are plenty of LGBTQ+ kids in their middle school and its not shocking to us, their friends, or the general community. They are still dressing fairly feminine- wearing makeup, skirts, etc, but getting pissed if their teacher (who only sees them for less than an hour a day on zoom) mis-genders them only a few days after being told about their new pronouns or someone in public assumes they are a girl (which, tbh, they generally look like).  I truly think this is less about gender and more just about being a typical teen with an overinflated sense of self-importance, but I want to help them move through the world without alienating people by being mad that the world hasn't instantly adopted their new identity. I know that this is really important to them, and it can be hard to remember that we are not the center of the rest of the world all the time!  Any suggestions on how to approach this with them so that I don't come off as un-supportive or transphobic?"	"yeah, I think it would be best to teach them to be less hostile.

I get it. like, sincerely, I do. the world is viscerally against trans people, there's legislation, people supporting it, etc.

however, I do think you should teach them to loosen their guard a bit. I don't really think it's just about them ""being a teen"" (since, 99% of the time, teens are like that mostly from social factors) though. they're probably expecting the worst out of everything and are, as you said, alienating people who would've supported him.

if someone purposefully mocks and misgenders them for being trans, then yes, that's when it's fine for him to be rude back. but I think the idea of ""by expecting the worst you're going to achieve the worst"" really needs to be engrained in his head.
Let me start by saying I'm very impressed and proud that you are looking for answers from actual trans people. You could turn your kid onto some sites or books that might help them feel comfortable. Maybe ask him what's going on. It's very hard when you first come out to come to grips with the fact that he will have to come out every day, to every person he meets, possibly forever. Try and understand that for him, too. There might be something or someone making him believe he isn't supported, so he could be extra sensitive and raw for reasons he hasn't told you. I would stay away from telling him he could pass if he dressed a certain way, that could be extremely damaging to his view or himself and his view of you. Honestly, he has a right to be upset with his teacher, and sometimes people who are against trans people say they ""get really upset"" when they correct the one who misgendered them. But, what if someone kept calling YOU ""he"" even if you told them you were a woman? It just feels very personal, like someone doesn't believe you. Encourage your child to come to you to vent about their teacher and remind them you're on their side. People will never stop saying he's ""too young"" until they say he's ""too old"". Just let them know you believe them.
The area you live in is almost always irrelevant when dealing with teens. They are assholes no matter where they live. They haven‚Äôt been mis gendered a few times since they came out, they been misgendered their entire life, which hurts more after they come out and it still happened. I doubt a 13 yo is only dealing with all the adults in your area or is it from the other teens doing stuff and adults not doing anything to stop them like it typically is in all schools. Being supportive means you support them not try and blame it on teenage angst. Talk to them see what the real issues are, that ‚Äúchip‚Äù could be coming from all the parental figures in their life just dismissing their existence as a phase and the others saying it‚Äôs just them being a cranky teen. Wheres the support coming from, I say that just tolerating someone isn‚Äôt really support.
I would definitely talk to them about giving others time to adjust. Frame the conversation in a way that it is about other people‚Äôs attitudes and not their own. They are absolutely right to correct their teacher and others when they are misgendered and are entitled to whatever emotions that causes, but the truth of the matter is that we live in a cis-normative society and being misgendered, especially early in transition, is a part of the trans experience. Encourage him to be firm in his assertions that they are male, but to allow others to make honest mistakes. And always, always, always validate his feelings. If being misgendered makes him angry, it makes him angry and nothing but personal growth and time can change that.
Side note: connect with PFLAG if you haven't already, and connect your kid with a community of Trans kids around his age. Look into http://camparanutuq.org/ !

And read *The Transgender Teen* by Stephanie Brill and Lisa Kenney. Share it with your stepson, along with *Where's MY Book?* by Linda Gromko. Spend a lot of time with http://t-vox.org/resources/trans-book-list, too.
It is hard to hear you're to young to know you are who you are when most people do know who they are from a young age.  Also your stepson could be a guy that likes ""girl"" things like skirts and makeup and that is totally fine!  The most recent season of RuPaul's Drag Race had a ftm drag queen, and he came to realize he could be a guy who loves makeup and drag, and that there is nothing wrong with that (Gottmik, is also omg with fashion).  

If his bio parents are struggling, one thing I told my parents when my mom was struggling with my sister (I think she was ten or eleven and while my mom is supportive to the LGBT+ community she was scared of what my sister would have to go through in life and so she reacted badly at first), I told her that no matter what my sister would always be my sibling and my mom's child and isn't that the important thing to know?  That really was a turning point for my mom.  

Also find out if your son is interested in doing hormones blockers to halt puberty (of they haven't already started) since that helps a lot if you are able to do that before deciding on hrt, which he may already want to."	mut5jk	trans	17	0.95	2021-04-20 15:40:22
got removed from r/aita for a 'debate'	"Apparently when other people take issue with you it's your fault for encouraging debate ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I wrote an entire post about my relationship and the impact social media has in it since im transüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

There's one sentence mentioning the snapchat post my gf and I argued over (for context) - this context is likely what the mod team is freaking out over üôÑ

(I even told other people in the comments that it wasn't pertinent to the conversation, so they reprimanded me instead of the commenters)

Not even that mad, I'm just not sure why it surprised me to have the 'ongoing conversation' shut down on the basis of trans identities being political üò¨üò¨

Edit - I've been banned because I 'really want an argument'. Their decision is final and my post contains issues that cannot ever be fixed üíïüíï"	"I'm sorry that happened to you. I know how that feels.
Wait so did they ban you for not providing context to the thing that started the argument? That seems like relevant info for r/aita post.
Oh, the mods there are hot garbage. I got banned for saying that i don't care about Nazis getting punched in the face.
What was the snapchat post about? Sounds like a key element in their decision, and you might've missed a detail that got you banned because of group rules. From where I stand it seems like you're withholding info here.
Sorry you got banned, but that sub is garbage.
It's just frustrating üôÑüôÑ I'm just glad we have a safe(ish) space to communicate thru our various trans forums üíïüíï
Yeah you would think relevant info would be necessary but including it is what led to my deleted post üò∑üò∑

Mods got back to me and said I'm breaking more rules than I iniitially was and to not ask for the chance to repost or edit info - their decision is final üôÑ

2 rules were broken -

8. No debates or political opinions.
11. No issues that are only pertinent to people who you're dating.

This story could've been about my mom telling me the same thing as my gf and it wouldn't change at all (i could also remove anything they determine encourages debate)- but mods told me I can't make any edits and I don't have permission to repost in any way üíïüíï
Lmao - Nazi's deserve protections too, you know ü§îü§î /s
The first line had to do with the snapchat post (the rest of the post references the conversation of social media and the impact it plays on my safety) - it doesn't explain why they told me my post wasn't able to be edited if the first sentence was the problem üò∑

They said rule 12 first and then rule 11 after I explained that rule 12 didn't really feel accurate. Rule 11 doesn't apply because the relationship between my gf isn't the problem and it could easily have happened with anyone else in my life (person is worried about my personal safety when posting to social media, said person puts boundaries up that I'm uncomfortable with - aita for arguing with them when they're really only worried about my safety?)

The mod team was pretty aggressive ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm not purposefully withholding info I'm just upset that I was told 'their decision was final' after I explained how I felt that the book was being thrown at me

I was told to 'take my 'no' and read the rules next time I join a sub' -banned for 3 days-
Yeah it's honestly my fault for thinking it'd be a good place to go lol üôÑ
I don't believe I have enough context of your original offending post to determine if this was them banning you for being Trans, or just regular modding.
Then again, I can't judge without the specifics, but it seems to me like you broke rule 11 from what I can piece in this discussion.
They are telling me it's regular modding - they also told me their decision is final and I'll be banned if I try to post again.

They started out saying I was breaking 1 rule and added another after I explained that I felt the initial rule they said I was breaking was inaccurate. I double checked the rules to make sure but it doesn't matter because they made a 'final decision' on my post (wtf does that actually mean)

They referred me to r/FindaSub and encouraged me to 'read the rules' this time I find another sub üôÑ
For more explicit context - ive been told rules 11 and 12 are being broken (first rule 12 and then rule 11 b4 they banned me)

11. No posts regarding ending a relationship, cheating, dating someone, doing sexual acts, etc. (They argued that since my post references my gf then it's falling under this rule - this rule explicitly mentions ending or continuing a relationship which was not the point of my post. Really my gf could be swapped out for my mom or a friend and it'd be largely the same)

12. No posts encouraging a debate - if judgment relies on people agreeing with your stance on a broad issue then it's not appropriate...

So we start to see the issue here ^^^

My post -barely- had to do with me being trans and really only explicitly mentioned it once : this is what they removed my post for initially

When I told them it was inaccurate to say my post required people to agree with me on trans rights (because the post had more to do with social media and its affects on me and another person who worries for my safety) they threw rule 11 at me.

When I said rule 11 didn't apply and that it feels like they're throwing the book at me, they banned me for 3 days and said I was looking for an argument ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

'Take your 'no' and find somewhere else for your post' -banned for 3 days-
I 'broke rule 12' but then after I said it didn't feel that was accurate they said I 'broke rule 11' - final decision

12 - no debates (I wasn't offered the chance to edit my post to remove any need for debate since i wasnt there for that anyways)

11 - no posts like should I date/break up, cheating issues, doing sexual acts - the issue is specifically with posts that have an interaction that will only ever happen in the confines of an intimate relationship (if I change the story to say that my mom is upset instead of my gf nothing changes - the fact that her and I date isn't pertinent to the issue I had)

I was told I'm not allowed to modify my post to make it fit the rules - and they banned me when I questioned why that decision would be made over a post I'm trying to fix üò¨
I dont want to sound judgemental... but right now all the evidence I've been given is your testimony, one that questions the moral standings of the mods of one of the biggest subreddits on reddit. This combined with the fact you have yet to actually show me the offending post for clarification like I've asked and the fact that you would have an incentive to hide this if in fact the modding wasn't transphobic leads me to believe you are misrepresenting the evidence.

So I will repeat, I do not believe I can comment on this matter unless you can provide full context of the post, so as to be able to conclude if there is a transphobic aita mod or if you are misunderstanding a mod ruling.
I did not see this reply, this is useful
Yeah those mods sound like they should be banned from the internet permanently, final decision.

Birth name	"My birth name is Charli and I am ftm.

I associate my name with nicknames like charli kate (kate being my middle name) and charli girl both of which I hate, as well as CK which I am ehhh about - it was my favourite of the three. They where used often by my extended family due to my male cousin also being called Charlie.

It‚Äôs unisex name which was good as, before I knew I was trans it didn‚Äôt cause dysphoria (unless used with nicknames stated above). I don‚Äôt hate the name at all but I don‚Äôt want to be seen as feminine. If there is a chance people will here the name charli and think of a girl (due to it being used for girls names) idk i just don‚Äôt like the idea. 

But also because its been my name when I was a girl it is associated with that. Though I never really thought about gender enough to see myself as a girl even though I would say I was when asked because thats what I was told to do. 

Its the name I have had my whole life and I have had no problems with the name Charli when it is by itself. It would be unusual to go by another name and I dont want to have to put people through the ordeal of getting used to a new name.

Id have to come out to people that already know me if I wanted them to use a different name as the name I pick would be fully masculine (not unisex or feminine). I am only out to a few people as well as the internet. 

As well as this the people that used to bully me chanted my full birth name in a rhythm mockingly. I don‚Äôt know if this has much impact on my views towards my name but it annoyed me when it was said - I definitely don‚Äôt like the length of my name and I think it is too long. 

I am unsure on what names suit me. Idk if charli suits me for example. I think because I have been so dissociated from myself and my body most/if not all of my life. I still am the majority of the time now and it is therefore hard for me to see myself and therefore know what names suit me. 

I want to change my middle name kate to alex because I hate the name kate and always have done. I like the name alex and it is a cool middle name but I don‚Äôt think I like it enough for it to be my first name.

Like I said I think my name is too long so I think I should just go with caswell instead of caswell *duh-duh* (my second last name- dont want to say). Though, I think, if my mother knew that, she would be v mad as that is her side of the families last name.

So my name would be Charli Alex Caswell if I were not to change my first name. However, I personally like the name Josh/Joshua and it would be my first option if I do decide to change my name. If I do decide to change my first name then josh/joshua is not a definite. 

Some other names I like are Alex (if not the middle name), Elliot, Elijah, Oli, Riley, cody, kyle, callum and tommy. I dont have a strong connection to any of them - probably because of that dissociated view of my body. I think I would suit the name Josh/Joshua but i am not 100% sure. It is my favourite name that I have considered so far though. 

Joshua Alex Caswell could be the result! Idk if it suits me or even if I want to change my name. I don‚Äôt really know what to do from here and how I figure out what I want to do."	"Don't try to accommodate to the ppl you come out to, if you personally have problems with your name. They are not the ones who will carry it, you are. If you think Joshua suits you (and Joshua Alex does sound rly cool!), then you should absolutely go by it.

The ppl you come out to will have to get accustomed to seeing you in your real gender anyways, a new name isn't going to make that any worse. 
The only thing that would be in favour of keeping it would be imo, that your friends and family won't call you by any wrong name. 

Ofc you need to decide for yourself though and that's just my opinion! 

Good luck to you!
I'm a cis woman named Charlie but a lot of people call me Chuck. No one ever hears Chuck and thinks girl.
It's totally valid to change your name even if you had a masc or unisex name already. I changed my name from Alex (the most genderfluid name known to humankind) to Azael (sounds cool) when I came out as nonbinary
I'll say that names like Oli/Oliver and Elliot/Eliott are popular trans names, I go by Owen personally
How about changing for Charles, or some other variation of your name that is not associated with girls, you can keep charli as a nick name for it and still present your self as charles if you don't know how someone will se you, i made a similar thing with my name.
If you want to see what I look like (to see if I suit a specific name) go into my bio and go on my tiktok n look at how I look üòÇ
My first name was joshua (but I went by Josh) and it's technically unisex now but I changed it cuz it didn't suit me
Well, I like Charlie.

\*pouts\*

But seriously, pick a name that works for you, that's meaningful to you, not a name that you think other people would like but you don't.

It's \*your\* name.

Yh the debate for me is if the minimal discomfort i have with my name is enough to change it and deal with the response. Maybe I just change it online for now and then see how it feels! Thansk for your input!!!
My dad calls me chuck üòÇ
That name is so cool! Damn!!! Thanks üôè
The name owen is nice to be fair (also the name of my ex but‚Ä¶ ew no). Objectively the name is cool!
I like the name charles as in my bestie calles me charles which I don‚Äôt mind but personally I don‚Äôt like it enough to call myself it and I dont think it would suit me
Most names are unisex i think but i feel like charli is a much common female name then joshua is. I have never heard of a girl being called josh/joshua.
Thank you!!! I like CJ its cool! My bestie calls my charles and has done most of my life which i like but I don‚Äôt personally like the name enough to use it as my main name but i think its a really cool name!!!
oh big oof, sorry about your ex haha
Fine, hope ypu find an awesome name that suits you perfectly, have a nice day ü•∞

I‚Äôm not even openly trans is the funny part üò≠ I don‚Äôt go around telling people in trans or ever correct people on my pronouns if they misgender me (I pass it only happens if they somehow know I‚Äôm trans) I came out in 6th grade. I am in high school. I don‚Äôt understand. People from my old school still try to deadname me and out me. (My name is legally changed.) I only went by that name for half of a year over 3 years ago. I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt be left alone ever. I don‚Äôt interact will people I don‚Äôt talk I don‚Äôt even go near people. People I don‚Äôt even know hate me and talk shit about me 24/7. I don‚Äôt even know these peoples names. They somehow know mine though. It‚Äôs not fair. I try so hard but nope, I‚Äôm not a human ig I don‚Äôt deserve basic respect or even less than that. If I sit next to people (which I only do if theirs no completely empty desk blocks, they get so upset and move away from me. Not even bc they wanted to sit next to their friends they will move and sit completely alone they are just mad I had the audacity to be in their general direction. People get so mad.  I don‚Äôt understand I‚Äôve never done anything. Even my friends treat me as less Tran everyone else I‚Äôm not seen as a person it doesn‚Äôt matter how hard I try.	"They do that because they're transphobic and they know you're trans, it's nothing you did and nothing about you. I'm really sorry you have to go through that.

At least you know what they are doing is wrong and pathetic, they will never be smart or good people or if any of them will be then they will regret what they did and be ashamed of it. Hang in there. You're wonderful and amazing. You're better than them, go live your best life while they amuse themselves trying to hurt minorities and having no purpose or emotional intelligence.

I'm ftm and somehow my mom getting mad that I have hair on my cheeks makes me weirdly happy	"So like my parents don't get the whole being trans thing about me and basically will never gender me correctly but today my mom's dumb remark about my (admittedly small amount) of facial hair made me both laugh and euphoric.

Keep in mind that I'm pre-T still atm, I just happen to get more facial hair because of my PCOS.

Anyways my mom said that I shouldn't shave my face and that I look like a man. When I said that was the point she got mad and asked me if I wanna look like a monkey. Idk there's no winning here though considering I'll still have the hair if I don't shave lol. I'm just kind of happy about it and feel that might be why I'm getting gendered correctly in public more often.

Can anyone relate to me?	"I run a Fortnite photography account on instagram that's seperate from my main and I feel beautiful taking pictures of the pretty characters I use and writing captions for what I feel about them. The skins mean a lot to me. They're all I get to be who I really am inside. What angers me is accounts that are dedicated to showing how ""thicc"" they are, by taking videos of just their ass doing dances. They're taking what I feel is an extension of me and lewding it. What makes this worse is that people I talk to on there don't see it that way. They don't get why I'm so mad about it. Some of them don't even see it as sexual and think it's a joke. It really angers me. I hope some people here can relate?"	"I tend to make feminine avatars and play female characters, but you have to remember others don't think of it the same way you do.

This is the closest thing to a shitty coming out I've had	"I came out two years ago, but I did almost nothing about it. I was still living with deep internalized transphobia and fear of the transphobia of others. On Monday I had a giant realization and I finally came oUT to myself after 26 years. I'm not ""a man who looks like a woman"", I'm not ""a man but I have XX chromosomes."" There was always a ""but"", always an asterisk, always the feeling that I'm not ""really"" a man. But that's not true. Transphobes be like ""oh you're just a woman pretending to be a man"", but no, I'm a man who finally, finally stopped pretending to be a woman. Full stop.

And I've been so, so excited about it. I feel like my entire life has changed. I'm so happy. I've cried from joy so many times this past week. People have called me ""Adam"" without me asking. So I don't blame my partner in his excitement when he wanted his parents to use the right pronouns with me.

My partner accidentally outed me to his parents on the way to their house for 4th of July. He asked them to use the correct pronouns. I was so mad. His mom knows, or must know, he reasoned. She's my facebook friend where I am basically dealing with my actual coming out. He was trying to help. 

But I hate those moments where the sentence stops and jerks at the pronoun because someone is unsure or uncomfortable. Or even worse, the fact that by the end of the night, they had just rearranged their sentence structure to just refer to me by my name. I hate it. I feel like a freak. I feel like there is an elephant in the room. I feel like I should be acting more masculine. Like they look at me and they still see and girl and go ""wtf?"" 


I don't care if you call me ""she""; because you think I'm a girl. The problem isn't the word, *the problem is you think I'm a girl*. Unless/until you can accept that's not true, then just don't try. Just use feminine pronouns and I will deal with how that feels. Whatever. Because this awkwardness, this sticking out, this feeling of every eye being on you and finding you deficient as a man is not okay. If you can't do it, then don't try unless or until you can. It just hurts. I'd rather just keep pretending to be a normal girl than feel like an abomination of a boy.


Aaaaaaaaaand now I'm crying and get to feel super manly about that too.


We're at his parents' house until Sunday. Fuck. 

I could really use someone to talk to."	"Honestly, I find it better to take people at their word. Since we're not mind-readers, if they say ""He,"" even if they stumble but eventually say ""He"" you can only assume they mean it. 

It's better for your sanity to stop there, and let either that person (or your partner) deal with whether they really believe it. You'll stop worrying about ""behaving like a man"" when everyone reaffirms what you already know. You're a man. How you behave is actually how a man behaves, because you are one.
-Hugs-
Just remember, however you act IS manly, 'cause you're a man. You're acting like a man whenever you act as yourself. Hope that helps.
I know its hard to get to grips with people stumbling over the correct pronouns. But they do need to practise and they will make mistakes. Just try to let it bounce off when they do fumble. They will get there in the end. Hugs xxx"	3c4azn	trans	15	0.89	2015-07-04 17:19:21
Am I wrong?	"About a month ago, I came out as trans to my parents. They've used my proper pronouns occasionally but they mostly missgender me. Whenever I correct them they get mad and assume I'm getting mad at them and never apologize for missgendering me. I've not heard a single ""oops, I meant she, sorry"" from them it's always ""*she*"" then a repeat of what they said. I just feel like they dont truly support me because they always correct themselves, then missgender me in the next sentence and never apologize for either times. Am I wrong for getting mad about this? Aita I guess."	"Nope. Completely valid about it
Definitely NTA. I would explain to them how misgendering hurts you. Hopefully, that'll help them understand the importance. And, honestly, if they're still disrespectful after that, I would just try to distance yourself from them. You can't force people to change, but that doesn't mean you have to deal with being disrespected.
Patience is key. My parents still misgender and dead name me and I‚Äôve been out to them for 9 months. I don‚Äôt live with them though. I also understand from their perspective that they‚Äôve spent years believing me of one way and to all-of-the-sudden change that overnight is a challenge. Old habits die hard.
Would they support you talking to a therapist? Having that outlet could be helpful, especially if you can't distance yourself.
Definitely NTA
Yeah distancing myself isnt an option since I'm not old enough. But i just haven't worked up the courage to tell them to stop and I've considered not bothering because it seems like it's more effort than its worth.
Yeah, I understand things are a bit harder since then. I hope you able to find some peace. And I know one day you won't have to deal with that anymore!"	pubkpm	trans	16	1.0	2021-09-24 03:39:04

She‚Äôs ready to be arrested, she‚Äôs mad as am I.  

Just looking to see if anyone in Kansas has more info about the law and any kind of activism I can help with. I‚Äôm in Missouri."	"SB 233 is probably what they're talking about.

It enables the revocation of license for anyone who provides or enables gender affirming care for someone under 18. It passed the senate yesterday and now goes to the house, which overwhelmingly passed a trans sports ban the same day. The governor has used veto against anti trans bills in the past and we can hope that she does the same here and they don't get the votes to override.

As for what you can do, I'm not aware of any protests but supporting those as you can when they happen helps, you could also try writing to the governor to express concern as a neighboring citizen, not sure if that'll do anything but it's not nothing.

I feel really unsafe and hopeless living here and watching this happen, but can't afford to leave yet.
Just shred them before the law goes into effect
I live in Kansas. There's unfortunately quite a few anti trans bills making their way though the legislature. The only ray of hope is Governor Laura Kelly has made it clear she will veto any of these, and the legislature lacks the votes to override the veto. 
It sounds like whatever officials were visiting were putting on scare tactics. Absolutely disgraceful. If your daughter got their information, I would encourage her to call their superiors about this. I'm not an expert in medical law or anything, but this seems like a drastic overreach.

EDIT

I've done some cursory googling, and I can't find any medical records bill coming up. I work in local news, and I'm almost certain I would have heard about this. OP, I have to say again, please encourage your daughter to contact whoever came to her office and demand answers. There's no such law in the pipeline. If she's not comfortable doing so herself, DM me and I can get her in touch with someone at my work.
What happened to confidentiality?
Doesn't that violate HIPAA laws? The state should have no right to access anyone's personal medical records without the explicit consent of the patient, ESPECIALLY if no serious crime is being committed.
Wow this is unnerving. Even if the governor vetoes it, it‚Äôs scary that government officials are trying this before any law is passed. Baaaaaad vibes

It's not easy, but it is possible to not interact with your neighbors. It's harder when they used to be friends, but it's still possible.
Lol same discussion with family members.  They admit they misgender me when I‚Äôm not there but really make no commitment to get it right, but then also expect me to still want to visit regularly in spite of the constant ‚Äú*He‚Ä¶ I MEAN SHE, SORRY*‚Äù every other sentence (if they catch it at all).

She also told me that after like 2 years she will call me by my name. Not sooner and I can't ""force"" her.

First of all, yes your mum is transphobic. There is no other way to describe this dismissive and deeply disrespectful reaction.

Basically, you are free to make visual changes that you like. Changing hair and dress style is definitely a start. A binder would certainly also be interesting, but please educate yourself about sizes and wearing times here - permanent wearing, especially a binder that is too small, is unhealthy.

Regarding your mother, it will be difficult and depends on your relationship and her person. Showing her that her behavior is a betrayal of trust, but doesn't stop you from being yourself, is an fair option. She's the one making the mistake, not you. If she does open up at some point, it's your decision to go along with it or not, but you don't owe her anything.
Try to talk to her about how important tightening your chest is, and how you may harm yourself if she doesn't get you a binder

Would someone be mad if I told them I wanted to change my new name?	"I came out to an old friend a few years ago and she was really supportive, initially I was thinking about changing my name to Andrea and that is what I asked them to call me. Then a while ago I was going through some old game saves and noticed how often I use the name Noelle and how much I like being called it. I talked to people before online about it and they said Noelle sounded much more natural and I do agree Andrea is a little forced since it's just the feminine version of mine. 

Anyway I wanted to talk to them about it but I really don't want to be a pain... Do you think it'd be a problem? Or am I just making too big a deal over it?"	"if they're truly supportive then no they won't be mad
Your name is your name. If that friend is unhappy for some reason about you changing your name, is that the friend that you deserve?
You could always pick one of them as a middle name, maybe use one with friends and another formally, or online. Andrea Noelle is nice.
It shouldn't be a problem at all! Anyone who supports you will just be happy to be calling you the name that makes you feel the best. Noelle is such a beautiful name!
We think coming out means ""I am this and I always was this and I will be this forever."" I came out as agender, voidgender, trans boy, and demigirl to a close friend before I got to genderfluid. And now it's transmasc genderfluid. People change and we all need time to explore in our transitions. And a lot of trans people go through multiple names, it's not just you.

Has anyone else been on r/honesttransgender lately?	"Triggers: discussions of transmedicalism, enby-phobia, and brief mention of biphobia.

&#x200B;

There is a large thread growing full of people denying the transness and even the entire legitimacy of nonbinary identities. I never knew how many transpeople felt that enbies weren't actually trans and its a bit shocking tbh. Theres also a lot of transmedicalism going on in the subreddit and its incredibly worrying to me. 

Like, I am mad knowing that when we should be standing together more than ever there are idiots still bickering about whether nonbinary identities are real and ignorantly acting as if they're a new phenomenon started by tumblr. A lot of the same talking points they use to de-legitimize my identity are the exact same one used by conservatives to say transpeople in general aren't real.

While I understand some enbies don't identify as trans, which is fine -as its ultimately up to the individual as to how they wish to label themselves-,  it seems cruel and gatekeep-y to say that they shouldn't.

 Like yeah, the experience of someone experiencing dysphoria throughout their life and then transitioning in their 30s from a man to a women via hormones + surgeries probably isn't the same as a  non-dysphoric tiktok teen using xer pronouns , but having a different experience doesnt mean that someone is wrong or doesnt belong somewhere. Not all cis people experience their gender the same, neither do transpeople- no surprises there.

It just feels like I have no community or support sometimes. Mainstream society doesn't accept or want me yet the Queer Community doesn't seem particularly welcoming or eager to accept me either. A similar thing happened back when I still identified as a cis bi - I was viewed as a spicy straight or some quirky white girl wanting to score some oppression points and I felt like I constantly had to prove myself... don't even get me started on the whole 'straight passing' shit.

Life is hard enough, can't we just stop with this weird 'I have more rough than you do therefore your identity isn't as valid' type non sense? I've never felt welcomed by the Queer community and like, it would be nice to feel accepted somewhere -anywhere- at this point."	"Toxic garbage fire of truscum villainy.
it‚Äôs a toxic dump, no one should go there
Non bianary people are valid.  Honestly I don‚Äôt understand it but why hate on it.  I‚Äôve meet many of this people in my life.  They are usually not happy people and try to justify why they are better than others.   In my day it was if your trans you have to be offended by these words or your not really a woman until you had your surgery or your not a man unless you had a phaloplasty or any number of things.   Hell I‚Äôve been accused of not really being trans.  They went to the police and told them I was a serial killer from california trying to escape a murder rap and when joining the military didn‚Äôt make it go away I changed my gender to escape.  


Don‚Äôt let them bother you.  I can‚Äôt imagine that these people are anything but miserable.  Every enby I‚Äôve met has been awesome so far and if it makes you happy you have my support.   I may not understand it but that doesn‚Äôt matter.  Also enby sounds like an amazing name.
I can't help but agree. It's unfortunate because there were some controversial topic essays I was wanting to chat about but like- most of the controversial stuff they discuss just seems to be about dunking on other queer folk...
Yeah Im thinking of just leaving it - the mods there wont even let you say the words truscum/transmed, much less call people out as such even if its true."	10ggn12	trans	15	0.8	2023-01-19 23:24:59
My husband finally saw transphobia/homophobia happen in real time last night. (Looking for advice)	"For context: I‚Äôm Vincenzo (24 trans masc)
Chris (26m bisexual) is my husband 

We announced our pregnancy last night, and it was how you‚Äôd expect any couple too. 

‚ÄúChris and Vincenzo are expecting Baby due in December 2021!‚Äù And a cute picture of a onesie. It‚Äôs pretty normal as far as announcements go, his sister did one, and we‚Äôve received them from his relatives before. 

But when we asked Chriss mom for the addresses of the relatives who have sent them to us, he was met with backlash. From someone he considered a major part in his support system. 

Moms asking him questions like ‚Äúit looks like your adopting a baby‚Äù (we asked her how that‚Äôs a bad thing and she couldn‚Äôt answer) 
‚ÄúDoes Vinny know they have to be on T for 5 years before they get any surgery?‚Äù (We explained to her that‚Äôs not true in the slightest, she didn‚Äôt believe us.) 
‚ÄúIt feels like the whole pregnancy is gonna be about Vincenzo and how they‚Äôre pregnant!‚Äù (We tell her that I am the one who‚Äôs pregnant, so the pregnancy is gonna be about me and my baby, she‚Äôs the only one making it about reproductive organs.)
‚ÄúAre you gonna leave Vinny after the baby? Because your not gay?‚Äù <<<and this question is where things got bad. My husband says he‚Äôs bisexual, my gender makes no difference to him. She replies ‚Äúbut if they‚Äôre a man, your gay? Your not gay right?‚Äù To which he says, ‚Äúif it‚Äôs either straight or gay to you, I‚Äôm gay.‚Äù We didn‚Äôt think anything of it, because her sister is gay, my husbands cousin is gay, and there are several other lgbt members of the family. 

But it‚Äôs a problem.

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want you to be embarrassed when our relatives know.‚Äù By this time, I‚Äôm on Tiktok, I have mentally left the conversation, I‚Äôve used all my emotional energy explaining my genitals to a woman who will never see them. But my husband was fucking devastated. 

Of course. Mom still makes it about her, SHE doesn‚Äôt want Chris to be mad at HER. SHES just looking out for his interests. SHE cares about how people see him. 

Well he hung up the phone, and genuinely had a conversation with me about ghosting his family if he needs too. He was angry, and tired, and nauseous. Mans never experienced any of this first hand before. 

I told him transphobia happens everyday and to combat it with his mom, he needs to explain to her how he feels, and that this isn‚Äôt about her and her out of pocket questions. 

I think I‚Äôm really just looking for advice; how can I support him now that he‚Äôs realizing his family doesn‚Äôt except him?"	I'd say talk to the gay relatives you mentioned and see if there are more people in the family he should cut out now before they become problematic too. Also I know for you the trans one this is just same shit different day, but this is the first time your husband is seeing this I'd say just be on his level and greave with him.	o6c9b4	trans	15	0.89	2021-06-23 12:56:23
In a long term relationship with a transman and my family wont accept us. Any advice?	"Hi! I'm new here in reddit but I badly need some advice. I already talked to few friends but they have different opinions on my issue and I was hoping to hear more from you guys. Even if we don't know each other personally, I am very much willing to listen.

So here goes.. 

I'm a 26 y/o female from the Philippines who is in a 5 yr (turning 6 on Feb) relationship with a transman   who is also from the Philippines. I came from a quite religious old traditioned  and conservative family because my parents grew up in the province. When I was in my teenage years, I started dating boys but my parents were against it. In the Philippines, parents can be very strict. When I was in my last year in college i met a lesbian who is now my boyfriend (currently transitioning to transman) To be honest I never imagined myself being in a same sex relationship. I was all about boys then. I didn't enter this relationship because I got my heart broken with by guy, no. It just felt right. My parents knew about it and they got mad with the cursing and all and it just hurts so bad that they judge the person just because he's a transman. They are so disgusted they have so many comments about it! They are really against this whole same sex relationship because they say nothing good comes out of it. That I am destroying my future because I am inlove with him. (For the record they don't know the different between lesbians and trans) That God didn't make gays and lesbians only man and woman and all that shit that homophobic people say. So from then on I just told them we broke up just to shut them up, so no more issues. Then I moved out of the country with my boyfriend. 

Fast forward to 5 yrs, we are happily living together BUT still without the knowledge of my parents. I have been keeping it from them for years because I wanted to protect him from all the hurtful words my parents will say to him. My relationship with my boyfriend has matured that now we are thinking of a future, our own family together. It has been bothering me for days if now is the right time to tell them everything. Of course I am so scared of what might happen after. And i am pretty much sure they would want me to choose: them or my boyfriend. I never wanted that to happen because he is my family now, 

What do I have to do for them to accept me? Us? I wanted to prove to them that he has never put me in any danger and that my future with him is as bright as sunshine. Because i think for them having my own children and having their own grand children is like the greatest achievement. Ok I want that too but with him, and when I am totally ready. I have found my soulmate, the love of my life but why do i feel like my own parents want me to be unhappy and be with someone that I don't love. I don't know anymore. I badly need advice üíî"	"this will be hard advice to hear, but you may have to choose between your spouse and your family. your family will be the ones to put you in that position, unfortunately.

if you want to try to get your family to undersrand, you are welcome to try. you could try to explain the difference between being trans and being a lesbian (since your boyfriend isnt a lesbian, he's a straight man) and they could perhaps be more accepting about that. however these kinds of views arent really something that can be changed just by a discussion. unreasonable ideas are hard to change.

if having kids is important to you and your parents, perhaps you could look into invitro or adoption to talk with them about it.

it is grim, but you should be prepared for the worst. if your family is full of hate and unwilling to change to see you happy, then you are better off without them. im sorry you're in this position, i truly hope everything I've said is wrong and your family can come around!
Hey, you aren't the one ""choosing"" your boyfriend over your family. Your family is choosing their transphobic, sexist and homophobic ideas over *you*. You could try reasoning with them some more, if you have the energy to go through that again, but it's unlikely to work.

They have to know that your love for your boyfriend is non-negotiable, and they have to respect it, whether they agree or not, if they're going to stay close with their daughter. It's scary and it hurts, but it sounds like you already know you don't want to twist your life into something that would make them happy (and that's assuming they'll ever be fully satisfied). But whatever happens, you need to keep in mind that they're the ones who have to choose to either hurt or love, not you.

Good luck <3
It sounds like you've found someone you love and have a healthy relationship with, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that and anyone that says otherwise frankly is outright wrong and doesn't understand it.

The best advice I can give is to lay out all the facts and have the courage to give them an ultimatum. You are not choosing between your family and your partner, THEY ARE. You could have a full rich life with your partner AND your family and you're clearly willing to put the past aside for that, but that's not the issue, the issue clearly is will they do the same for you.

Whatever you do, be safe, be calm, and remind them that you've done nothing wrong and neither has he. If they refuse and remain stubborn that's on them and you will have to choose to leave them behind.

One thing I will say is, don't walk away angry. You have every right to do so, but leave the conversation telling them that when they're ready to accept him and apologise they're welcome to do so. Being the mature and levelheaded person in the room will speak louder in a situation like this.

I'm sorry you have to go through something like this, wish you the best of luck <3 x"	7abnal	trans	15	1.0	2017-11-02 13:55:27
My dad won‚Äôt use my pronouns and it hurts	"TW: Transphobia


So I went to dinner with my dad last night bc 1) I hadn‚Äôt seen him in a long time and 2) I wanted to come out to him as trans. Thankfully I had my partner there for support, but what followed was a 2.5 hour long dinner in which I tried to explain what being trans meant to me and how I wanted to be referred to from here on out. I told him how being referred to as ‚Äúhe/him‚Äù and as his ‚Äúson‚Äù made me uncomfortable and that I‚Äôd like to be referred to as ‚Äúshe/her‚Äù or ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù in the future. He basically said that he accepts who I am and still loves and respects me and will have my back no matter what, but he‚Äôs still going to continue calling me by masculine pronouns and that ‚Äúit shouldn‚Äôt matter what people call you‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not saying this to call him out or to make him feel bad by shaming him on a public forum, because that‚Äôs not how society should work. I‚Äôm saying this so hopefully it will help him or someone else reading this realize that misgendering someone, especially someone who is trans, can be harmful. You can say you love and respect someone all you want, but if you go against a simple thing like their pronouns because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù, how much do you really?

I know that someone asking for you to change the pronouns you use for them is hard. It definitely takes time, especially if it‚Äôs someone you‚Äôve known for a while, or even all their life. I can‚Äôt speak for all trans people, but I know I would never get mad at someone for misgendering or deadnaming me if I had JUST told them my new name and pronouns. I know it takes time, and all I ask for is a conscious effort to try and change, even if it takes you months or even years to fully make the switch.

My dad misgendering me throughout dinner wasn‚Äôt what made me upset enough to write this post. It was when he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be blunt for a second, but I want to be honest with you. I‚Äôm still going to keep calling you by he and him because that‚Äôs how I know you as and you can‚Äôt change how I see you.‚Äù That stung and it stuck with me. You can‚Äôt say you accept me for who I am and then in the very next sentence say you‚Äôre not going to respect how I want to be called because it‚Äôs not convenient for you. Last time we had a big argument about how he treated me, it took me threatening to cut him out of my life to make him change his ways. I really hope it doesn‚Äôt come to that again.


To all of you out there that do respect my pronouns, thank you. I love and appreciate each and every one of you. üíôüíñü§çüíñüíô"	"""You can‚Äôt say you accept me for who I am and then in the very next sentence say you‚Äôre not going to respect how I want to be called because it‚Äôs not convenient for you.""

This is absolutely true. He does seem like he loves you and is open minded though, perhaps he just needs some time, exposure and education. I hope it doesn't come to you having the threaten to cut him out either. Best of luck to you, dear : )
Maybe it‚Äôll be easier as your appearance evolves.
my dad had, while not as bad, a similar reaction when i first told him. stuff like ""i see you as my son and that's it"" i also heard from him and i was just having lunch with him alone (happy you didn't make that mistake). It hurt me pretty badly and as I was questioning then, i spent 2 days doubting myself again without getting much sleep.

But he just needed time. By now (1 year later) he uses the correct pronouns mostly and calls me his daughter. As you're dad seems supportive like mine i am sure some time and education will help.
Thank you!
Hopefully, I already dress pretty femme."	s0nymf	trans	15	0.89	2022-01-10 16:28:30
So, umm, I‚Äôm in a bit of a pickle here with a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù	"I have a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that I recently told him I didn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore. I told him some reasons about how I actually felt that would also let him not question it. I told him a week or two ago that I was Pansexual. He said he supported me, but since he was religious, he kept telling me that it was against the Bible as it said that it was sin and whatnot. He knows I‚Äôm atheist too, so I don‚Äôt know why he was showing me that when I clearly didn‚Äôt believe that stuff. He tried to make me read where it said that this was a sin, but I didn‚Äôt and faked reading it because he was already confusing me whether he truly supported me or not. Last week or so too, he up front told me he‚Äôs not into that transgender stuff. Like, WTF

This happened at school lunch too. I sat down with him and he was holding onto someone‚Äôs stuff while they went to the bathroom. I asked who‚Äôs they were‚Äôs and he said [deadname]‚Äôs. I was confused and when they came to get their stuff I corrected Noah with their preferred name. Noah got agitated and argued with me then explained his transphobic thoughts to me. He said that because he never thought that one of his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù would actually be transgender. (I‚Äôm MTF)

This made me not want to be friends anymore, and led to us not being friends now. So, now he sent a text saying that we‚Äôve become distant and notices I‚Äôm no talking to him anymore, and said he thinks I‚Äôm acting mad/sad near him. Like what do you expect? Us to not be friends and still laugh and talk with each other? He‚Äôs also never had to deal with losing a friend because he told me. He also asked in the text if I could tell him why I‚Äôm acting weird around him and not in front of everyone i talk to. I was thinking about telling him that it was because he acted sort of homophobic and was clearly transphobic. I‚Äôm also worried he‚Äôd catch on that and suspect I‚Äôm transgender after I tell him why I‚Äôm actually doing this. He also told all of his friends we weren‚Äôt friends anymore so I‚Äôm also worried he would tell others of his suspicion. 

Sorry for the long post. Any advice or help is appreciated. Thanks. Have a lovely day (everyone) edit"	"‚ÄúBrother and sisters‚Äù, friendly reminder that a good chunk of us here aren‚Äôt men or women.

Anyways, you have no obligation to continue to interact with him, especially considering how shitty he‚Äôs acted so far. You don‚Äôt even have to tell him that you‚Äôre trans or anything more. Just let him know that stuff he‚Äôs done has continually made you uncomfortable, which is why you‚Äôre no longer talking to him. Good luck!
Hmm. If I were in your position, I'd figure his parents or some other boomer got to him and told him all kinds of trash.
It's not his fault; not yet, anyway.
He's lost because the way some folks treat us? That's how they'll start treating him if he stays friends with you.
Now, back in ""my day"" (I'm 41)this could be a real problem. Folks like us were actually killed over this stuff.
But now? Like I said; I'm 41 so I don't know what ""kids today"" are thinking about and going through. Oh, sure; some of it - the basic stuff. But as for the specific picture of your world today? I literally cannot imagine.
But if you value your friendship, try to see that he is lost, too. It seems to me you are not quite ready to call this friendship quits, and neither is he.
In short, I think you both ought to tell the adults in his life to sit tf down and be quiet.
But then again, I was expelled from many schools and I did time in prison over my lack of willingness to conform to anyone's expectations of me.
If you chose my way, there are few more difficult roads to take.
I don't really know what to say about this but he's a Bible banger. tell him that he has no reason to be transphobic besides personal beliefs. trans people are not mentioned in the bible at all, only crossdressers.
Sorry, I edited the post.

Thanks. This helps a lot and I think I‚Äôm going to do this
""A woman shall not wear a man's garment, nor shall a man put on a woman's cloak"" is the verse I am talking about by the way.
Yeah. You could say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt associate with bigots or with homophobes. I know many lgbtq+ people and I won‚Äôt associate with any hateful person who wishes ill to them. Also you‚Äôve tried to shove your religion down my throat not understanding that I don‚Äôt believe in your invisible man in the sky.‚Äù"	yaw8pj	trans	15	1.0	2022-10-22 19:23:46
How do I help him?(long post)	"My husband is trans(ftm) and his family is a nightmare. He came out when he was 19 and his family was horrified, like he had said he killed the neighbors dog. He has come out 3 times since then and is now 30. They still call him by his dead name and use she/her pronouns. 
We have been together 5 years and in those 5 years I have heard it all. ""Why can't you just be a lesbian?"" ""You are a girl, it's the way God made you."" ""I'm sorry but you will always be a girl to me."" ""It's a shame you turned into a lesbian, now you say something like this."" ""Maybe you should pray on it, God can help you not feel like this."" I'm honestly sick of it and I know he is as well. His mom's husband even went as far to say... In front of me, ""it's not to late to find yourself the right man and settle down. Don't you want to be happy and  normal?"" 
Now flash forward to when we got married last year in Florida. it was just our mom's with us and my mom is very very supportive of my husband. She will correct people and go out of her way to compliment him. With it just being the 4 of us I think my husbands mother saw this and being the sheep she is, started calling him his male name and using he/him pronouns. She even said she was the mother of the groom. He was over joyed and thought finally. He had the chance and took many of them to tell her how he felt. She seemed to listen and realize that he had felt this way even at a very young age. When he told her everything, she cried. She called his grandma and said how bad she felt that she never saw it. They talked about it and we thought omg finally!!! 
But as soon as we went back home.... It was right back to his dead name and she/her. 
His mother said it was because ""nobody knew him that way, and it's just going to be easier to not have to explain"". It's honestly sad because in a way his family has pushed him back into the closet. It's was like that week in Florida never even happened. 
He is forced to use his dead name and pronouns around his family and others. I just don't understand and I'm trying really hard not to get mad at this. I try to be very supportive and I would do anything to make him happy. But at some point you just kinda gotta ask why. Sometimes I feel like they do it just to spite him. I well say he and in the same breath they say she/her......
What do I do? What do I say? Can I do anything? Or is it up to him? Help me!"	Really just being supportive helps but I think he is going to have to realize he needs to cut contact with his family. It sounds like they are a bunch of bigots who will never give him the respect he deserves. There‚Äôs really no point in wasting any more time on them. Although I do understand its really hard to go through with it but isn‚Äôt him sparing himself all that pain worth it? He deserves to be respected as the man he is.	vnamz8	trans	14	0.94	2022-06-29 08:17:22
