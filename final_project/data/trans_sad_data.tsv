My 103 year old great grandma corrected my transphobic cousin on my pronouns!!	"My great grandma (I call her baba) referred to me using they/them pronouns and when my cousin said ""you mean she"" baba just replied ""no, I meant they"". My cousin was a bit unnerved because she is 103 and accepted me so easily. Words cannot say how happy I am.

Update: Sadly baba passed away about a week ago and I'm not on speaking terms with my extended family."	"Transphob: bUt ThEy/ThEm Is CoNfUsInG fOr *OLD PEOPLE*

In this house we love baba
Wish I had a Baba in my life 💜💜💜
When you get to that age you just give zero shits about what society thinks and just love your family. Well at least I think so. What a badass.
Based grandma 💜✌🏼😊
Oh, I was feeling a tad empty and this just filled me back up!
We love you baba
Because age is no excuse I hate people who say oh you can't expect grandma to respect your pronouns she's from a different time my 85 year old grandfather has a trans son and he fully accepted him from the start
I’ll always remember my conservative, kinda racist grandpa using my name and pronouns years before my own parents did.  He even sat down and had a heart to heart with me about how he didn’t feel that they were treating me well through this.  Sadly he’s no longer with us but those words from the least expected source really stuck with me and made an impact in my life bigger than he knew.
If someone born 100 years ago can do it what’s everyone else’s excuse
My heart! It's so warmed! She really is great!
I love baba, give them a hug for me <3
please hug your baba from all of us. family like that seems to be a rarity in the community and i know i would(ve) love(d) someone like that <3
Omg yay! My 103 grandma (oma) also gets my they/them pronouns right! We absolutely stan
wow that's just amazing. you have the best grandma.
Please tell Baba that this internet stranger hopes to be as amazing as she is some day!
That's cuz Grandma's know, Grandma's are incredible. At least mine was and she lived to 103 and I miss her dearly... If you have a connection with your grandma your great grandma and it's a good one they'll always be there by your side, forever even when they're gone to leave little signs that they're still around watching over, some people might not believe this for me I do and I'm so glad and so happy for you that your grandma gets it she's an incredible woman and you're an incredible person.
Huggz Becky 🇨🇦
Yes!!!!!
Saving this and showing it to anyone who comes out with “they’re a product of their time”
My Baba is 82 and says her generation doesn't understand this stuff 😥
Baba is queen, we stan an ally
This reminds me of my brother's ex's grandmother.

(For the sake of the story we'll call my brother B and his ex E)

E's grandmother sees me immediately has her arms out to hug me and says, ""you must be one of B's brothers!"" (I'm a demi-boy and use both terms brother and sibling)

E's parents ""correct"" her saying ""sister"". I immediately say ""sibling"" as I don't want to be misgendered and I didn't want to say brother after they just ""corrected"" that.

E's grandmother without hesitation goes, ""Sibling!"" And hugs me. E might have been a mess and her parents might have misgendered me a lot but her grandmother was *chefs kisses*
that's awesome!!!!! your great grandma is based
Grandma probably would have slapped the shit iut of your cousin if her hand qouldnt fall off. You should get her a sword
**When Babushka has had enough of the cousin's shit**
Based grandma lmao
Grandma giving quite the W vibes
My great grandma was very similar. I came out to her via letter. As soon as she'd read it she called me and said how it must have been so difficult to tell her and that she accepted me. She got to 108 years old before she passed. I've had way more crap from people in their 40-50s than with actually old people.
A saint
Based!
What a legend.
Times are changing.  My family is doing our best to remember to use ""he/him"" for my sister's offspring.  I even got him a necklace from Spencer's that says ""He/Him"" and he loved it.
your great grandma sounds amazing
Damn.... I wish my siblings will accept me since one is 5 and the other is 9
Baba deserves every bit of respect
Based baba
Yea..it’s only really boomers that have an issue with us, silent gen couldn’t care less. You gotta love em
AWWWW THAT IS SO SWEET!
Protect Grandma at all costs
Old people are either the best or the worst, there's no in between, you won the lottery
Based baba (give her a hug from me pls)
Jesus, I cry for the littlest things. This is so sweet and gives me hope for the world. Go grandma!
My grandma is the same way and 🥲 happy crying
great example on why age is not an excuse to be a bigot
She sounds like a wonderful woman ❤️
Best grandma. My parents tried for a second and gave up. My dad texting me ""hey they"" was hilarious though.
Hi OP, thank you for posting this as this warms my heart! Both of my Babas (grandmas) on my mom and dad’s side recently learned that I identify as a trans girl and my pronouns are she/her and they accept me, love me, and want me to be happy and proud who I am. Sometimes the older generations can be more tolerable than our parents. They been on this Earth for longer you are their baby’s baby (or in OPs case add a baby lol) after all. 

Lets not mention how inherently toxic Eastern European culture can be towards us, so its powerful to see them choose love ❤️
For my final paper for my bachelor's degree I focused on the pride celebrations, from the original protest in Stonewall to protests, marches and parades all over the world now.  When watching footage from the late seventies pride marches (in response to the save the children crap that was being pushed at the time) I was actually happy to see how many people actually told the interviewer that they were there to support everyone.  My favorite interview was an old grandmother there with white hair and she told the interviewer that parents should love their children for all that they are and that she did not understand how a mother could turn her child away.  There were tons of families and relatives and friends all there to help everyone LGBTQ+ show pride.

The one mistake so many old people make is they stop learning new things. I'm glad baba hasn't fallen into that trap! Tell her people on the internet are proud of her!
Based baba
A friend's grandma interrupted a transphobic discussion at last Christmas eve, remembering some friends' daughter and said : "" I don't know, maybe she has become a man now cause she sure felt like one"" She was so casual about it that it shut the idiots mouths. This was old news to her, that some people were transgender. Old people can be far more progressive than their entitled boomer kids.
Grandmas are just 🤌🏻
baba is the most epic grandma
your great grandma is a gem
Blessed be baba!! This made me smile.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ok your baba babushka is amazing
Based baba based baba
Astounding. That sounds so validating. I hope baba is well, she is quite old.
W Baba
I keep getting told that old people wont ""get me"" and my grandma can't know because it'd ""kill her""... yet, all the older people I've met, in their 70s, 80s and 90s (I'm a caregiver) have had no issue gendering me correctly and just plain ol' accepting me and them finding out didn't kill any of 'em.
It's so cool to see the older gen accepting us. It's admirable because they were raised differently from us in a conforming society. It amazes me how she slid with it so easily. I was struggling with internalized transphobia for years and I've finally overcome it.
congrats pal :)
The greatest grandma

Grandma has accended beyond mortal worries. She shall accept all for who or what they are.
Damn, she old af. Also fuckin nice
THAT is fucking awesome. that woman was born before the great depression, and now she’s a trans ally. that’s just so cool
Aw that's wonderful! Based baba
Your baba knows what’s really important in life
I fucking love it
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GO BABA

How come it's always all or nothing with grandma's, like half of them are like this and half of them are saying there is mics from the government in the Mcdonalds toys
This is beautiful.
Baba sounds fucking awesome
Tell your baba I love her. She sounds like such a kind lady.
Babas are just the best. ❤️

People forget that aging doesn’t negate the time spent as a teen , a 20something  or any other age in between . Your Grams ❤️
What is her daily routine HOW DO YOU LIVE THAT LONG
Sweet baba :)
Get this woman a medal
Unfathomably based
Giga chad baba
So happy for you and your baba!
Your great grandma is peeeeak, no one has an excuse to misgender anymore. If your centennial grandma can show basic respect for pronouns then everyone can
I'm glad your Baba kept up with the times. Especially since she was born right after/during WW1
Holy Fuck!!! What a Gem!!!!
Fellow Bulgarian yeah?
Now this is something. 

I already like your grandma

All of my great grandparents died before I was born I had a great auntie who passed away from leukemia about 3 years ago
Why wait till that age to have that kind of energy. I'm trying to get that shit going asap lol!
Babadass
Op should tell baba that the Internet now thinks she's awesome
I may be stupid but, what's baba?
100 years.

How insane is that.

She has seen so much.
Baba deserves a zweihander.
Yeah it’s funny to see how easy it is for elderly people to understand that pronouns are vital to someone’s being, when slugs like you still don’t see it yourself.
Why are you here man
I can’t tell whether you’re transphobic or not. But if you are. Please find a different subreddit. You have a choice to not cause trouble

Judging by your other content. You might be. But I shouldn’t make that generalization
""I just call THEM"" dude... you played yourself.
“Funny… I just call **them** “it”.

****them****
Evidently you do not
Yup.  My Granpa is in his 90s and extremely religious, and even he gets most of it and accommodates my needs accordingly.

Turns out, if your family truly loves you, they will respect who you say you are.

Same with my great grandmother. It's just I was about 5 and don't remember her. She also died of cancer, damn that fucking disease. The sad thing is, I only met her when she was just 25 hours away from passing. At least she's not in pain. My great grandfather had died sooner also from cancer.
Rest in peace ❤️
Effen A right! TBH it took me almost 30 years to adopt that mindset but, it was worth the wait. Eff judgmental dbags.
It's what they call their great grandma
What is this, ‘respect’ from family
Respect? From family? Preposterous, that can't be something that exists. /s
Turns out if your family loves them, they will respect who them say them are

It took 38 years for me to figure out when you don't care what people think it becomes increasingly easy to be truly happy.  All of a sudden, many cares in life fade away. I'm not saying if you have money issues, they suddenly will disappear.  But it does mean that you are free to do what you want and not what anyone else says you should do.
22 years so far of setting no boundaries really so I feel you! Really trying to get on that dgaf imma be me and f everyone else vibe.
Thanks for info miss

Might I say you look fabulous, and the hair looks beautiful
Gorgeous
You pass already
Cut the..  For why?!
Goth gf 🤍🤍
I also had to cut my hair, my case was for my new job. It's been a few months since and take it from me, it does not make you any less valid. You are still you, and it'll grow back when things get better.

I'm sorry that you were forced to cut your hair, but lucky for you you have a gorgeous face so could pull off anything. Keep positive, not long now till you can be in charge.
the shorter hair looks so cute and doesnt make you look any less feminine
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL ✨

You're lovely! Shine bright you(:

If you have pierced ears, dangle earrings look great with short hair.
Who forced you to cut that gorgeous hair? :(
Making the airplane bathroom look glamourous
I think you are pretty. Why forced?
hair still looks good - is that an airplane bathroom pic?
The hair will grow back. You look amazing though hun!
Wowza!
You're so cute it's a damn shame you had to cut your hair :( it will grow back at least. Hope you find a situation where you can be yourself.
Your hair is still beautiful
Pretty!
Damn you're gorgeous
Pretty cute 🥰
Whoa!!!
Imagine looking this radiant !🥺💕😖 Your rock this
u definetly look gorgeous
whoever made you cut your hair will be cut by me tonight.
SO PRETTYYYYYYYYYYY
Looks amazing
Girl are you on a plane??

That’s awful about the hair, it’s so nice.  I think about my own head just reaching the awkward “baby bird feathers” length and how long it’s taken to get here, how long it will take for it to be as long as I was when I was a teen...

Still, at least you have something to look forward to when it grows out again!
Very pretty
You got a side part? How the fuck do you keep it out of your face
You look really cute!
Wunderschön 🧡
why'd you get forced to cut it its very nice hair?.
You look great, sorry about the hair, same thing happened to me
Hair looks hot on you
wow
Si cute
Far as I can tell, you're just a beautiful lady. If I saw you on the street, wouldn't even cross my mind you were trans. I really don't like whoever made you cut your hair... it's absolutely gorgeous; I'm literally envious. If you really want it, find a way to get out from underneath those that can do that kind of thing... I did - it just hurt a bit... or a lot, I guess. And yea, a few bridges were burned. But for me, that was fine. You're killing it, girl.
Looks great!
Pain why did the hair have to go
Enjoy all the karma dear, you look amazing🤭
Wow you look amazing.
You present heccin femme.
Is that a seal of orichalcos?
Would you go on a date with me?

What do I think? I think you’re going to very very happy with your results when you start girlie. You are sooo cute ❤️❤️❤️
Daaaaaayum girl. Lookin cute 🥰
Sadly not. That's pre. i loved that hair
T'T thank you
Both and thanks
Where do you find a unicursal that big though like???
I don't know how you look like. (I am lucky to have  incredibly skinny and feminine body form) but other than that. Shaving, make up to contour and make the face look more feminine, breast forms and a bra (not to big!) And some nice fitting colors depending on your body type to look more feminine but still me. (Black can hide a big crotch better than normal jeans with other colors)
Finally someone who got it. Thanks
It actually is considered harassment in my country. But it is my father so
Because it looks to girly for my father
Sure can
I am 19 and my father doesn't know that I'm trans and meant my hair is to long and that it doesn't suit a men so... cut
It is illegal
I am very comfortable with wording. Thx
Nonsense. You are frickin pretty as well. I love your hair sweetie and thank you
Thank you i know just gonna take some time
I hope so, (am still scared of it)
Utaxo UT-BH001 actually and thank you
Im sure you can
How what?
Or does the WatchDogs logo look like my Necklace charm?
I'm Mtf
I actually don't do much, i shower every third day of the week, use shampoo and then body wash for the rest of my body. My hair gets oily very fast, i always just style with my hands and it makes that wave all on its own. (The lighting in a picture often helps when it comes from up down on the hair in a picture.)
Make up
Thank you, you too
Thanks for the advice
My dad
Because my dad thought that long hair looks to feminine
It is an Train bathroom actually.
It's a train. And yee at least something
O don't. It is growing around my eye that's frickin creepty but it barely falls in my face. Except in sports
It's to girly for my father i should have a short hair cut like a manly man
🥺 thx love
I know, right?!!
Sorry sweetie not interested rn.
I'm amab and didn't got hormones or any operation so just me.
not all trans people take meds or even dress like their preferred gender, and it doesn’t make them any less trans. so no it doesn’t mean they’re cis
Excuse me? You need to be a bit clearer
This is a troll account so OP don't be offended
We're gonna need a big F in the chat folks.
Oh nooo! Rip. Thankfully hair grows back. 

Speaking of hair... I might have to cut mine again soon. It’s getting kinda long and idk how to feel about it. Maybe I’ll cut it mostly just in the back, cause it has a bit of a wolf cut situation going on rn, and not really in a cute way lol
Sorry you were made to cut it. 😢
Oooo right that sucks :( i hope you can finaly be yourself soon after you have moved out sorry idk how old you are but i asume your 17 or 18?
Maybe she’s just tiny
Killstar is the brand. It's called hexagramm choker on their site.
Oh also longer hair
93 93/93 :)
But... But... You are the cute. Why does father not see the cute?
You live in a civilized country. Report him. REFUSE. Do not go along with it. Do you have the option to move into subsidized housing if you need to get out of an abusive situation?

You got the looks girl!
My beard hairs wont let that work... even if i do 30 mi utes a day shave its not smoove
I am sorry. I would have taken you shopping and brought you to Macy's to have the whole makeover done at one of the counters. 

Someday you will be able to say you are a woman and I will do what I want
How's that his choice then?.
I'm AMAB myself. It's a compliment. If I met you IRL I'd think you were cis, no doubt. Oh and by the looks of the toilet you're standing inside I'd assume you're living in Germany.
I know and thats not what my comment is about. OP looks like a cis girl/woman to me, thats it. Emphasis on looks. You get it now? A compliment, although hidden, but it's there.
Is ok, np

Shaving with the growing direction and then against a couple of times should help getting somewhat smooth. Then make up to get away with the beard shadow.

Sounds like hes real serious about haircuts.
And there the troll goes. And thanks for the back up but i can't quite agree. I'm always open for *constructive* criticism if it's explained why. (And sometimes i couldn't give more shits about it, but that's probably the diva in me.)
Obey father for now and then big spinny fun later
About not being a man. I should be the kind of person to wear a nice shirt and leather boots with short hair and cut nails. Like a gentleman. It would be a disgrace if I’d get any piercings or dye my hair in another color. Or being gay or trans. Especially being trans
I agree but just calling you ugly wasn't constructive at all. They just came here to insult.
I look forward the sister I will get to know. 💙

A really pretty sad raccoon lol
Well jokes on them, Sad Racoons are cute 😊
Your makeup looks amazing! It really suits you. It's really doll/alternative like.
You're absolutely ^(where's the lie tho) beautiful! ❤️

You remind me of Wednesday Adams.
You absolutely look amazing 🤩 
NGL, I totally love the smoky effect 💘
Have a beautiful and fantabulous day 😊
Fun fact, sad raccoons are cute
you look stunning omg
I've never seen a raccoon smoulder
Parents are stupid. My dad said my sister looked like a stripper when she was wearing a 4inch suede heal. Try to ignore them. You look great! Cute goth doll vibes.
I'd say more of a calculating raccoon, if even a raccoon. Also, you look great.
sad raccoon in a good way
an elegant and glamorous raccoon with a story behind her eyes...I love the make up!
You look amazing!

Your parents still need a while to deal with their emotions.
You look like a model <3
You look fantastic
you look great, you really remind me of the woman from Trans Voice Lessons!
Trash panda are awesome.
You are eye ridges and the way you do your makeup just makes it look sad. However I don't think I've ever seen anybody pull off the look as well as you do. Like it just really looks good on you it matches your face really well and everything's working together. But because of the outward points of your eyes being down it does make it a look a little sad. Hey you are so pretty and you're still giving gender envy
I think it looks cute on you tbh. Don't listen to them they're being dumb.
You look beautiful  your makeup look amazing.
This may be true, but if so - sad raccoon is SO my type!
You've done a fantastic job 🤩
Reminds me of 60s make up
I see it, but racoons are adorable just like you :)
With eye makeup, less is more.
Damn, are you M2F? You look stunning!
Your so beautiful I love it
It’s the lighting of the photo.  Makeup looks nice.  Not over done.  I always think subtle and “less is more”  is the best way to go with makeup but that’s a preference.
Beautiful

I think you look aggressive

You look beautifully ominous

I genuinely wouldn’t have ever thought you were trans if you weren’t posting this pic in this subreddit. Was scrolling past this and thought you were a cis woman asking!

very jealous of your skills but also you just have a nice face 🥰
Your parents are right. But sad racoons cool.
You look fabulous 👌
Reminds me of early 2000s scene kid makeup. It suits you though
You look gorgeous, sweetie. Verging on Goth, is that your intent?
had to check which sub i was on, youre so pretty!! your makeup reminds me more of like a tired opossum rather than a sad raccoon tho lol, but i think you look really great :D /gen
You look great
A very cute sad racoon, but they aren't wrong...
How about mysterious n smokey?
That is so cool, very elegant noir! I love it
You are a very beautyful raccoon!
This makeup look suits you so well!! You look INCREDIBLE!!
Roxie Raccoon, you just made me swoon! You're gorgeous. Wear that look with swagger.
Stunning
also that top is hella cute
Cute racoons girl
you look like a cute sad racoon
You got the genetic lottery, and the makeup skills! I’m jealous!
They're not wrong, but they're missing the point that you're literally the most beautiful person in the world in this picture.
You look like a raccon having an emo stage, and it's a great look!
I think you look magnificent and a little intimidating.  It’s like saying, “I’m empowered to be myself now, so get on board or get out of my way!”
A little heavy on the under lid, but looking bloody hot. Also, you have an amazing chin.
maybe you should smile more ... :D

looks goth imho
U look really good and the outfit too
Looks cute! Just a tip, be light with the crooks of the eye, your tears can smudge it and run, also little crusties can form. 

But i love the overall ascetic
Your makeup is astounding. I'm super jelly about it.
if we have to make the comparison to racoon, you look like a badass racoon !

it's definitely a bit unusual, but it fits your pretty face very well.
Yeah, the eyeliner is pulling your face down. Something that takes practice is where to actually put makeup, and it always feels like it's going on higher than it ought to, but that's part of the illusion makeup is intended to create -- it lifts your face. When you put it too low, it pulls everything down and creates a droopy sad effect. If that's the goal, then you do you. It's applied flawlessly, just sort in the wrong spot.  Flip the wings to be above the eye instead of below, and it'll look a lot better
You should definitely smile but far from a sad animal.   You’re very attractive.
Your parents have no taste, it looks good
Mommy- Sorry- Mommy- Sorry- Mommy- Sorry-
You look gorgeous Pissman
You look like a gorgeous porcelain doll ❤️
omg I love it and I wanna do that make up now, but that feels totally my style so I am biased
Maybe it's true but still, hottest sad raccoon i've seen
It’s giving sad Victorian goth young adult, but in a good way.
ADORABLE I LOVE IT!!! ❤️🤲
Ur makeup looks great. My makeup makes me look like a clown lol :3
A cute sad raccoon👆👉
Your parents are so wrong you look stunning ♥️
I don't see raccoon, you're pretty af
But a very cute raccoon, make all the boy raccoon go BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
You have a very natural beauty about yourself. I like this picture...
My friends are always telling that i should smile more...
You don't necessarily have to smile to feel good...
Cute goth gf
They aren't wrong

Super cute tho :3
It looks great, dear. 💕
It's a roundish shape with dark makeup, probably where that comment is coming from. Personally I think it looks good, but an upward wing at the edge might stop any raccoon related comments.
It's probably the downward wings that make it look a little bit sad, but it's very well done! You look amazing!
Not everyone has to smile to be pretty. I think you're gorgeous in a very mysterious way. Do you and don't let comments like that get to you
Looks cute, I think the comment comes from that your outer wings aim down rather than up. 

If you're looking for constructive criticism, and have a shot without any filters (phone cameras usually default to skin smoothing) you should post to r/makeupaddiction .
I can kinda see their point but you do look like a very cute, sad racoon. 🤣🏳️‍⚧️🥰
to be fair to yokr parrents you draw the lined on the outside of the eye more downward which isnt the normal makeup style on the other hand it looks amazingly well done and i would love to see the trans racon makup trend go live now
I love it, you kinda look like Twiggy :)
You look like a Tim burton character! You so pretty!!
You look awesome!!! But seriously, raccoons are cute <3
Not wrong, but youre a pretty sad raccoon
Is that a top or dress? Really love the look! <3
You look like a young Myrna Loy. Look her up and then show her to your parents. Makeup goes through trends all the time. You do what makes you feel good about yourself.
Sad raccoon (appreciative)
A sad, powerful, and very cute raccoon.
I think part of it is that your eye makeup curves downward. Gives kind of a “dark tired circles” look.
Makeup’s hard and I’m still learning it too
You looking like a sad raccoon has nothing to do with the quality of your makeup. Its good, I can't notice anything wrong, although that depends on if you meant to cover up the eyebags completely or not.
I love it. 10/10
It looks great!! It’s cute like a raccoon /pos
Good but you do look like a sad raccoon
It’s so good! I wish I had your makeup skills!!!
Jokes on them. You are super cute!
I think it looks great!
Girl u should be a modele
😍😍
Yo, sad raccoon is a vibe.
I don’t know what a sad raccoon looks like, but if this is the look then I love the look of a sad raccoon!  You are gorgeous!
Oof parents sure can unintentionally say some really inappropriate things.

The only question that matters; how do you like your look?

(Also; v. cute)
I think it looks sad because it’s downturned. The makeup is well done. I bet if you did a reverse cat eye with it following your lower lash line then you’d look like a cute raccoon.
Sad but a cute one.
Nah girl you’re pretty!
sad raccoon is a good look on you. you look amazing
You do. A female racoon, but a sad one.
I'm a fan of raccoons
I mean you do but it’s a vibe
Smile, to be the happy racoon you are meant to be
Yeah... it's kinda true, but it's cute tho
For looks like this, you wanna angle the wings a so they're pointing towards the ends of your eyebrows.
I think you look absolutely amazing! 😃
Good job 😁
You look gorgeous dear🏳️‍⚧️❤️
You look like everything I want to be and more
Sad racoon is a very mainstream (and very pretty) makeup pattern. You look nice!
More like melancholy Victorian royalty 🔥 it looks good
I like it. Remember parents are often out of step with what’s up with fashion. I think you look more borderline goth, and soft enough for a modeling ad.
Nah, love it. You have the bone structure
OMG, CUTE!! Whatta hottie!! 😍😍
I think you look pretty
so pretty<3333
Your makeup is lovely.
Circa 1930’s cool
i think the ‘sad eye’ look is fairly new, so ur parents might not get it but my gen z sensibilities say you look amazinggggg
it's definitely giving a little bit of sad racoon. needs a little bit less eye shadow and some concealer under the eyes
Yes but a very cute sad raccoon
I love it!!
I'm getting more emo/goth vibes than sad-raccoon vibes.
Yes looks like raccoon but in like the cutest way possible /p and also raccoons are just adorable, anyways I love you're makeup!
It looks very nice ^^
Cutest raccoon I’ve ever seen
You look fabulous
Perfect 😍
first of all, raccoons are aDORABLE, so that's a compliment, secondly, you look very cute!!!
This style of eyeliner always makes people look very doll-like to me. It's a super good look on you
You look like a porcelain doll that my emo ass would adore.
what’s wrong with that 🖤
sanpaku eyes go hard 😩
u look gorgeous girl tf
I think it looks incredible.

Very creative, pretty, and captivating
Beautiful sad raccoon*
Your very beautiful
A pretty gore sad raccoon
Cute!! i wish I had makeup
You look like a movie star ✨ from the thirty's .. Gorgeous girl ❤️
yo that's an unusual and great eyeshadow look

\*looks again\* that's great! I'd love to see a detail pic of like one eye because that bottom outside edge action is intriguing

\*remembers the raccoon thing, hits edit\*

oh and objectively speaking, your parents aren't being genuine and the people on this page saw it because you groomed us to see it - except me because I used to be in marketing, so yeah I can tell you the sad raccoon thing? no it's not, you don't, they didn't, this is not that, you just look like you got something on your mind that nobody's ready to hear - a classic impression that only eyeshadow can deliver
More like Clara Bow

ETA: Or Anna Nocon!
You are beautiful and you’re makeup looks amazing. 😍🥰
That would make a great B&W photo! Very classic 30’s/40’s….🥰
ur so freaking prettyyyy i cant even but yea you do look like a sad raccoon because sad raccoons are adorable
To bad for them raccoons are unbearably cute
Getting more of a ""smoky goddess"" vibe.
I can see it lol. But I also see a pretty lady sooo
Cute cat vibes
You do look like a sad raccoon but it's a good look on you
You kind of do, but in a good way (raccoons are so cute ☺️)
Teach meeee aaaaaaaaaaaaa
You look fineeeee
Edit: fine as in Fine 🥵
im so gay
U r quite pretty but a smile would help
Yes, but a very cute racoon. The one that makes all the boy racoons go awoo awoo...

Lorelai Gilmore
I had the same reaction lol. Parents aren't wrong, but that's not a bad thing
Yeah when I read the title and saw the picture I was like, ""They aren't wrong, but it still looks good
Goth racoon.
Agreed, plus I love eye bags because of Shouko Ieiri and Okkotsu Yuuta
Make all the boi sad raccoons go WAAAA!
Yes ! Totally !!
Love it !!!  My little flapper !

A Google Chrome extension which marks transphobic links with red and pro-trans links with green.
No idea, I'm non binary and frequently post in these communities. Maybe a comment got misinterpreted as anti trans? It's weird cause I get messages every few months with similar questions about anti trans stuff and I never know what the hell they are talking about.
I cleared it for you for now, I suppose we'll see what happens from now on, perhaps some troll misused the extension against us.
Yeah just check my profile, most of my comments regarding trans stuff are compliments or encouragement in transpassing. Kinda frustrating someone would do that"	yvqjeq	trans	3568	0.96	2022-11-15 08:00:13
In-laws showed up to our door unannounced after learning I am trans (MtF)	"Some background before I begin, my wife and I have been together for 8 years and married for 3. Her parents are incredibly conservative, outwardly racist and clearly homophobic. They do not know we are married; it was a courthouse marriage done for paperwork reasons, and we plan to have our 'real' wedding later. Her parents do not know this, as my wife assumed they would not take it well. For the last few years I have been on a bit of a process of self discovery, which led to the realization that I am trans, and I began HRT about 7-8 months ago. My wife and I have talked a lot about our relationship and the challenges and changes that transitioning can bring about, and we are happier now than ever, and plan to stay together.

&#x200B;

This past Sunday, my wife decided (after months of planning) to finally tell her mom about me transitioning on her weekly phone call. We expected this to go poorly, and our expectations were met. Basically, they don't view trans people as people, and don't believe that it would be possible for us to ever be happy together. Her mom was convinced that I would leave her for a man, highly unlikely given that I'm a lesbian (and we're married). Her mom cut her out of the family, saying anyone who wants to be with a trans person can't be a part of her family. Obviously this was sad and disappointing, but not unexpected.

&#x200B;

Monday (the next day) was my wife's birthday, so I made her meals and gave her gifts when she wrapped up working from home that day, a little before 5. We had just finished unwrapping when there was a knock at the door, and I saw her mom's frizzled hair from the window. I was in running shorts and a t-shirt with no bra, no makeup, and no shower after working out, so in no way fit to talk to people who have never seen me as a woman. Mind you, they also live 60-90 minutes away, so this was clearly a planned trip. When my wife answered the door, they walked right into the house and demanded to speak with both of us immediately. I was hiding in our laundry so as not to be seen, and begged my wife to make them wait outside or in their car for 10-15 minutes while I got ready. Eventually they moved to our front porch, where they stood staring into the windows.

&#x200B;

I went upstairs, tried to calm myself and change clothes, then went down to deal with them. They were waiting on the front porch, and when I opened the door to walk out, they refused to back up or give any room, so we were extremely close to each other. Now, I will tell you, I had kinda always expected something like this. I have never shared that I am very progressive in my politics, but over the years I have known them, they have always worked to push my buttons. I typically don't speak when we are all together, and they have never seen me actually behaving like myself. Tbh, they have no clue who I really am, and never cared to know. I figured one day they would push me over the edge, but I always thought I would be able to control myself and my emotions. Please know, dear reader, that when I tell you what happened next, that I have no hate for people who alter their appearance for happiness. Clearly, I am willing to do the same, given the amount of HRT, hair removal, and makeup I go through on the reg. But when I opened that door and stepped outside, the first words out of my MIL's mouth were, ""Nice breasts"". Almost immediately and without thinking, I scoffed and said, ""Well, at least mine are real.""

&#x200B;

So that's how the conversation started. Everyone gasped and took a step back (except me, since my back was already on the door). I think she was extremely taken aback, as she has never known me to talk back, nor do I think she was aware that I knew she had a boob job (they're not big). But I think it surprisingly made everyone calm down a bit, as she realized she wasn't ready for an insult fight. For the next 5-10 minutes, she talked about how we are terrible, lying children, and could never understand the pain we were causing her as a mother. They said that there was no way my wife could make the decision to stay with me, as she couldn't view it objectively since she was in a relationship with me. They tried to convince us not to get married (bit late on that one, lol) because, as they put it, ""it's only a 50-50 shot this even works out"", and that I couldn't decide until I'd ""finished all that transition stuff"". They said it was fine for me to decide to live a perverted lifestyle myself, but immoral to bring their daughter into it, and that my wife's mother had the right to tell her what to do. My wife was amazingly calm, and made it clear that she could make her own independent choices as an adult, and that we were very happy together. All the calm logic in the world wouldn't help, though, as my MiL is nuts.

&#x200B;

Then came the real anger. My MiL said that her sister was threatening to strangle me with her bare hands, and to 'just wait and see what happens when I tell the rest of the family'. She then took out some cheap-ass dishware that I assume she was going to give as a gift, and started throwing it on our porch to break, screaming that this is what I was doing to her family and her mind. She said that her mind was broken, and that she couldn't control what came out of it, and that I should be worried for what that might mean for me. After breaking all the dishes (or trying, she isn't very strong so some of the dishes survived), she said ""clean up your mess"". I responded that it wasn't my mess, it was hers, but that since I was a reasonable adult that I would clean it up for her, and not call the cops if she left. That really got her going, as she started screaming that she was not afraid to go to jail, that I should call the cops and see what happens. At this point, her husband, who had remained relatively calm, began to physically drag her away to their car whilst saying, ""you promised not to go crazy... You promised not to lose your mind!"" She was raving the whole way to the car, foaming at the mouth and all. Not a pretty sight.

&#x200B;

We cleaned up the dishes and tried to decompress after. In hindsight, I'm super glad we made her leave the house before talking to her, as she clearly had planned this to happen in our home. I think she probably would have broken our own possessions as well, given the lack of control she had. I was extremely proud of my wife for handling herself so well, and surprised at my own lack of control in the moment. Guess the lesson is that it's really hard to control 8 years of pent up anger, harder than I would've thought. Luckily, I only responded in kind, and never even thought of getting physical or yelling. We haven't heard much else from them, other than one ""damn her"" text from the MiL on the way home (which, honestly, props for using the correct pronouns, I wasn't expecting that). We have been cut out of any wills, family events (thank god, they sucked), or contact, but since we never relied on them for money or anything else, there's no real effect here. Now I won't have to plan and pay for their funerals when they die.

&#x200B;

PS- I have nothing against anyone getting a boob job. If I weren't happy with mine, I'd totally consider it, but for some reason my mouth managed its own response in this situation.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Angry parents ambushed us at our house, screamed and broke things until they were dragged away. They ended up looking like fools, and we're still a happily married couple.

&#x200B;

Edit: My wife filed a police report yesterday, we may pursue a no contact order or something similar, but we have put up a security camera and arranged some pepper spray around the house for quick and easy access. Naturally, if I ever hear from her again, I will update all of you accordingly!"	"Proud of both of you for handling yourselves the way you did. It's very brave to stand your ground especially around parents. So I commend you on your strength. I'm also happy to see your positive takes from this experience. Though I am sad that this is something you two had to deal with. Thank you sis for sharing this. I think it speaks volumes to those that are looking for the courage to be their authentic selves. Hugs and kisses. All the best on your ""wedding day"". My wife are in a similar boat on that front. We married in the courthouse for papers and our love as we couldn't wait, and have our 'wedding' planned for this September. No more taking off my wedding band. It hurts so bad to hide that.
Whoa, that's literally the craziest thing that I've read in a while!

You should think about posting this to r/insaneparents.
Omfg ""at least mine are real"" best response lol
Yeah the MiL needs… something… probably a psychiatric hospital stay if I’m honest. Yikes.

So glad you two are okay! 💙
> “*props for using the correct pronouns*”

I lol’d

These guys are nuts, hope you and your wife are okay OP.
Honestly fuck your FIL for driving your MIL all the way there with plates to smash and then trying to say ""you promised not to go crazy"" like he didn't know exactly what she was going to do. He just wants someone else to blame when he dies alone in a cut-rate retirement home
As someone about to get top augmentation surgery, I personally gotta say I nearly pissed myself laughing imagining your quick and witty response, don't feel one bit bad about it.
I would have lost my shit when she stormed into the house. 

I used to be incredibly patient. This story only validates why we shouldn’t tolerate anything. Long before she appeared on your doorstep unannounced she made it clear she doesn’t respect either of you. 

I would call the police, and at least file a report. It would be nice to have that on record in case it happens again. Tho I would imagine when her local police knock on her door, and explain what she did wrong, it will most likely stop her from doing this ever again. If you don’t, she will most likely come back and do it again. Maybe even behave worse.
You're calmer and you're wife is calmer than I'd ever be if someone insulted my fiancée for being trans. Time for a restraining order! I doubt this is the last time MIL will go bonkers on your doorstep. Expect more. What a nut job. Sounds like my fiancees birth mom! We cut contact with her.
Good for you and your wife!  You are both so lucky to have each other.  

TBH you should probably report her uttering threats to the police anyways.  At the least they will go over to her house and put a little fear into her rage driven brain, and create a paper trail if anyone does ever try physical violence.  Don't underestimate crazy, it's always worse than you think.

My wife and I are in a similar position.  I haven't come out to anyone but my wife, and both our parents are religious.  My dad is fairly progressive but her parents are openly racist, sexist, homophobic, hateful people who only like people who are exactly like them.
[deleted]
Doubt I would have been able to remain calm in a situation like that, super impressive. May you and your wife's relationship only get stronger through this.
Wow. That's incredible, but sadly too believable. The nerve of them to do this on her birthday. Y'all handled it awesomely. I sincerely hope to demonstrate the same strength if ever forced to deal with something similar. Good for the both of you, stay strong and solidarity!
Proud of you and your wife standing up for yourselves

They can suck an ass for the way they treat you but you are valid no matter what :) 🏳️‍⚧️
Honestly this is pretty comedic, makes it clear who’s really the problem. Sorry you’re having to go through all this though ! Glad you have such a sweet supportive wife 💖
And transphobes will say trans people are mentally ill


Sheeeeesh 🙄



In all seriousness I’m so sorry you had to go through something like that, at least the trash took itself out though.
Proud of your wife and you for not putting up with the MIL's bull, and your initial comeback had me cackling. It's hard to stand up to family sometimes, but it seems like your wife and you are a great support to each other, so I guess it's easier that way.
Stay safe, OP, and congrats on the two of you getting that kind of toxicity out of your life. Much love to you both!
“At least mine are real”
*GREAT ENEMY FELLED*
About the boob job comment… I’m enby and took HRT briefly. A relative told me changing how I looked was not god’s plan. She had a breast reduction surgery the previous month since it was causing her back pain. And I looked at her and said “well god didn’t plan for you to have smaller breasts but that didn’t seem to stop you”
You get all the hugs OP. Way to stick it out. And a little bit of sass looks good on you girly
I think you handled it nicely. I want to encourage you to stay nice towards them. They can treat you like shit but they can‘t force you to dirty your hands as well.
I'd get a restraining order against them lol.
I kept expecting a ""and that's when [you/your wife] punched the bitch in the mouth,"" turns out you're more composed than me!
She sounds like a  grandiose narcissist, I love the dish she brought to demonstrate what you are doing to her. She says you are doing this to her family but she really means herself and her idea of what a family is. 

You handled yourselves perfectly, that one smart retort about her fake breasts put her back on her heels, she was not expecting that at all.. why ? Because she felt so %100  confident in her moral highgound she was thrown by your calling her on her imperfect world
I hope you both have endless happiness out of spite for such lowly creatures that shouldn’t even be compared to human.
This makes me so angry. Hopefully you can go no contact.
""At least mine are real""  
GOD THAT'S AMAZING

you go girl, don't feel bad about it, i probably would have said something worse
Ummm… If I ever become so narcissistic and bigoted that I hop in a car, ambush my daughter and try to destroy her relationship ON HER *FUCKING* BIRTHDAY, please dump me into a pool of lava. The sheer audacity of this woman, good grief.
You promised not to go crazy! You promised not to lose your mind!

🤣 Poor guy he probably just wanted to stay home and watch some sport ball too
that was really great and satisfying to read.
well done
Whoa. Great job keeping yourself together. I don’t know how I would react in that sort of situation. Also, nice burn!
You need to get no contact orders of protection against the entire family asap. They will try this again. They will step it up. They are insane, violent, and very dangerous.
Wow that's fucking insane!

Side note: I enjoy the way you wrote everything down. You reminded me of a character in a book , in a good way.
1. Proud of you for responding this way!! As calm as I am generally, if my MiL (or my own mother) acted liked that, I’d be hysterical.

2. I don’t think a response to “nice boobs” (I rolled my eyes so hard when I read that) required anything more polite that how you put it. 
Don’t dish it out if you can’t take it!
Honestly this was kind of nice to hear for a vent. I mean that experience probably was anything but pleasant and your wife maybe doesn't feel too good about her relationship with her parents, but other than that it sounds pretty positive with you two continuing your loving marriage and them straight up making fools of themselves. 
That boob line may be a bit harsh for anyone not deserving of it and I get the feeling of regretting not being able to hold your tongue but in that situation it kinda was a killer comeback. (And as you said it even took the wind out of her sails for a bit.)

Can only wish you two the best ❤✌
So sorry you had to deal with this but it sounds like you both handled it amazingly well. Your MIL is a not a healthy human and, honestly, I just feel bad for her that she can be so corrupted and disconnected from reality. 

I was in a similar situation where my partner's parents were not kind. My recommendation is to support your partner as much as possible and keep communicating. This is likely a very hard time for them. 

I love your boob comment and good on you. With irrationality, sometimes dishing some creative language is the only way to defend yourself and stifle a dangerous situation. 

I'm sending you and your partner all the best, and please be safe!
Funny thing is i had this happen but with my own parents they drove 6 hours to my place while my wife was home and i was at work so when i got home they tried to get me to move back and talk to a pastor lmao
Please take care of yourselves. I can’t believe people still behave like this. It’s 2022 ffs 😢 

Why can’t people let other be who they want and live who they want. X
It’s really nice to see that your spouse continues to support you in the face of their family. That is an incredibly challenging thing for someone to do. Even when their family comprises of psychotic cunts.
As someone who cut their parents out of their lives 7 years ago I would advise your wife to do the same. You can love your parents with all their faults and also have zero relationship with them. It’s not worth either of your mental health to have to deal with people like that. Just because someone is family doesn’t give them the right to treat you poorly. It’s truly liberating once you do it and realize how much stress is reduced in your life. If family truly loved you they would disagree with your choices but at the same time respect them and not act like this. I hope both of you have a great life together.
How did you manage to not burst out laughing when they said not to get married?
That is unfortunately - there is an increase of fascism, racist and cynicism growing in out country - glad you still together and let us hope progressive thinking wins this what I see war
Holy woah. Those are some wild in laws. I’m so sorry that happened to you - but major kudos to you and your wife for taking it so well!
Also your MIL sounds totally batshit MY GOD 😅
It's these kinds of stories that make me terrified to come out, and have no idea how to get HRT and not be homeless. You are amazing to have been able to put up with that crazy bitch, and I hope you never have to experience this again
op that was the best clap back.
While there’s nothing wrong with the boob job, the comment was certainly well placed. Seems to have shaken up her own confidence a bit, and told her that this wasn’t going to be a situation where she’d just be able to say or do anything she wanted. Shifted the power to you. So I think it was a good thing to have said anyway.
This is obviously a horrible thing to deal with but my takeaways from this are all positive. You sound like you are happy in your journey of self discovery and your identity and relationship and you have great support from your wife. That is the most important and is inspiring to read and makes me happy. Second you stood your ground without getting too aggressive or physical. It sounds like the incident could’ve gone way worse and you handled it great. So did your wife. Plus now you have all these pent up feelings getting a bit of release, they saw the real you and you don’t have to pretend any more. Also you seem to have cut ties with a toxic relationship for your wife and yourself. Just be sure your wife gets whatever support she needs cause it’s her family, but I’m confident you are already doing that. I hope you feel all the positives from this and take pride in your strength and your marriage and your future. A lot of times I read stories on here that make me worried or sad for the person and this just made me happy and inspired and optimistic for your future! I wish you and your wife all the best for your lives together though I don’t even think you really need any help, you seem to be doing great.
Sorry you had to go through this. On the bright side, your wife sounds awesome!
>""at least mine are real""

OP you are my new hero
Maybe I'm so used to managing other people's feelings but if I was in your shoes my first priority would be to make sure my wife is okay.

I am estranged from toxic family that gets explosive like this and it takes years and years to process the trauma. Their transphobia is in no way excusable and I think you did a fantastic job of showing that you won't be pushed around for their stupid ideals. 

Take care of yourself, then take care of your wife. She lost her parents today. Even if she felt like she lost them a long time ago, the day I made my estrangement official changed how I felt quite dramatically, even though I already wasn't talking to them or sharing anything. 

I'm glad you're okay and the MIL stopped when she did. Monsters.
And they call us dramatic 😭
Is it really loading control when you planned to do it hours in advance?

I mean, it sounds like the FiL believed she wasn't gonna, but she knew she was gonna have a fit when she bought those plates.
Personally not bodyshaming is only for people, and bigots aren’t people
Love the ""atleast mine are real"" comment, best I've gotten to use is "" atleast mine are fresh and perky, untouched by the hands of dozens""
""Nice boob job"" I just love that special brand of misogyny cis women reserve for trans women.
Your wife is an absolute boss!!  Wow

Also unbelievable catty instincts 🔥

The boob zing was sooooo solid
well. congrats on both of you for staying reasonably calm and mature in that situation, im glad neither of you were injured and that you dont rely on them for anything at all.

i hope your wife had a nice enough birthday despite that, and hope that she isnt too emotionally hurt by her family xx
Wooow. You're a hero, OP!
Honestly you should notify the police about this and get some kind of incident report just so you have a paper trail started in case she decides to do something even more unhinged.
Doesn’t sound like you lost control. Sounded like you honestly and clearly stated your boundaries.
Oh goodness sending hugs and astral projected tacos!  I am sorry you had to go through this
That’s awesome that you and your wife stick by each other like that. I don’t think I could have been this calm if someone insulted my fiancé. We are both mtf, and I know my parents are very conservative, so I have not even told them about our relationship yet. Much love sis.
Yall handled it perfectly! 

I would get done house cameras. We have blink from Amazon after my brother went off the deep end. It’s reasonably affordable compared to what’s on the market and motion activated, hooked to WiFi and you use an app on your phone. 

Unfortunately there is no reasoning with these people and your safety (and your wife’s) is paramount.  It wouldn’t surprise me if she comes back and does property damage.
Amazing story. Good luck with the rest of your transition
I would also add that the one thing I hate about this which in fact may hurt your wife but does makes your decision easier is that your MIL is putting her moral values and judgments above her daughter, they are more important then her daughter. They never got to know you at all before they found out. And they just bring the hammer down on both of you with no attempt at trying to understand who you are and what you are doing. It's all very impersonal to you and it's all about her.
Good for both of you! You each stood up and didn’t tolerate what was being thrown your way! Now if I could do the same and stand my ground with my in laws…le sigh. I’m FtM and yeah…they don’t approve of it. I met my wife before I started transitioning too, took them awhile to get used to their daughter being with a woman! Anyway!

Proud of you! Keep it up and don’t take anyones crap! 🧡
Holy fuck, that’s awful of them. Absolute Trash Bags™️, full stop. Kudos to you and your wife, the strength and perseverance you two have is a testament to real love. 🏳️‍⚧️😎
I just wanna say congratulations on standing your ground. Screw that crazy lady.
Oh. My. God.

I absolutely lost it at your father in law saying *""You promised not to go crazy"".*
And this is exactly what I'd be afraid of my parents doing if they ever found out. We certainly can't choose our family, but you'd think our family would choose us over their ignorant bigotry. I'm sorry you had to go through that, but it seems like you and your wife are handling it just fine so far. 💜
Kinda sounds worth getting a restraining order against the people who might be physically dangerous to you. I wouldn't expect police to take action for a ""family member showing up to your house"" unless you can also say they're not allowed to by law. You could diffuse the threat by telling those people that the restraining order is just for your safety, and if they want to bridge the gap, you can talk about it over text.

It is better to be safe than sorry
So sorry you had to deal with that. 

Honestly it sounds like you handled it incredibly well. Props. Not sure I would be able to remain that calm and reasonable.
Wow!!  That woman is a serious nut job.  Credit to you for standing your ground and refusing to be bullied.
I'd look into an order of protection. This doesn't sound like it will de-escalate. Sounds like she's rallying the troops for round 2.
I was literally talking to my therapist about my birth family today, and how I would probably never be able to come out to them, as they attacked and still don't respect my ex, who came out as a trans man at the time. While I know for a fact that I would only be making things bad by telling them, it still hurts a little to think that I can't tell them and have supportive, loving, non-hateful family members to talk with, go shopping with and invite over to see thier new gorgeous (IMO) daughter and maybe help her find her new style.
did i miss the part where you “lost control”? as far as you’ve written you said a single thing to the MIL. you were as cool as a cucumber from what i read!
am so, so sorry you had to go through this nightmare. you are so incredibly resilient in the way you handled the situation, though! hoping for the best for you and your wife! 💜
Congrats on getting married! And honestly your clapbacks were great. ""At least mine are real"" is a banger.

On a scale from 1 to ""hackles raised,"" what's the likelihood of them following through on whatever threats your mil made in her meltdown? They sound like empty threats from a madwoman, but I want to be sure you two are proper safe.
Don't deploy pepper spray indoors, pro tip from a seasoned security guard, just taze them
Uhhhh i read some real threats of physical violence in there. If you're willing, able and can afford it... if it were me... id get a g*n and make a safety plan for who to call and where to go in case shit pops off
First co grats on coming out and I hope you have a good transition. Second atleast mine are real made me fucking laugh so hard
Fuck your parents. I laughed at ""Well at least mine are real"".
I mean your a woman soooo *swing her by the roots of her hair 😈*
I feel like these are the kind of people who actually need “conversion therapy” and by that i really just mean a proper education on why all of those assumptions are baseless and misunderstandings of who trans people are.
Well they seem to be threatening your well being so I would consider making preparations to defend yourself. It almost sounds like she is threatening to like get her family to attack you. If you live in a place where you can get learn firearm safety and your right about defending yourself and get a gun. If you can't get a gun maybe a knife or really anything. Cause they do seem to want you hurt.
Honestly this is why I'm not that into the whole family thing. My brother is an ass and if he shows up at my house I'm calling the cops. 

So disappointing. I'm glad you guys were prepared but I'm still sorry you had to go through that.
Shoulda called the cops
Thank you for sharing, it was educational!
That's awful! I can't understand how some people can be like that. Props to you two for staying strong during it all and let Love win! Also props to your writing skills. This was surprisingly easy to imagine. Ever considered writing as a profession?
I’m sorry you had to go through that. Also I’m oddly pleasantly surprised the dad was basically there to manage the mom and didn’t say much?
Hugs to you both!
Good response, 10/10 meow. Making us proud OP.
Woah sounds like something straight from a horror movie! Sorry you had to deal with that!
I am littrally going through the exact same thing now apart they found out off other people and now I’m the worlds worst and my gf is making the worst decision of her life blah blah blah
Tbh while my parents are homophobic for the most part  cus some people in my family are gay and I myself is Trans but hiding it. If someone did this to me I'd be the person saying they need to leave or I get the sniper to take the shot. Kinda like a way to avoid being followed
Wow. I'm impressed with how you handled the whole thing. I would have probably lost it. Lots of love and happiness to the both of you
Time to file a restraining order against them.
Just to let you know I'm happy for you both. And don't let people like your wife's mom and dad Get you down.
My goodness what a read! You handled that better than I would of (I only just came to the conclusion I am Trans, lots of things to think about) but your wife is amazing too! She handled that so well. It is never easy when family are not open-minded. My father (if he was still in the picture) would have lashed out badly. I commend you both on how that was addressed and wish you both a happy future together. Your comeback to her was sublime and by all means justified.
>She said that her mind was broken

She was not wrong. But it wasn't broken for the reasons she implied.
Word of advice: call the cops early.

It takes a minute for then to get to you and if things go south it’s better for them to already be on their way.

Cops would much, MUCH, rather deal with cases where they can intervene early and prevent paperwork from needing to be filed than fallout after-the-fact.

Stay safe
I am so sorry you both went through this. I think if this is really what her parents are like she could consider going no contact. That was straight-up narcissistic rage.
Yup, this is the craziest shit I've heard in a hot minute. Damn, girl. I'm so sorry. I hope y'all are hanging in there 💕
I’m not sure what country/area you’re from, but if it’s the US, please consider getting a gun. 

This woman is clearly planning on hurting you herself or pushing another family to do it for her.

A police order and pepper spray won’t do much if somebody shows up armed at your home looking to harm you and your wife.
This is more or less my biggest fear about being out to my extended family… I have a lunatic grandmother who has done things, including, but not limited to: kidnapping the bride at a wedding that she apposed, trying to get my parents to divorce (twice), and screaming at everyone in the household over me saying one swear word (damn) and leaving in a rush. I’m terrified that she would haul her ass up from the south just to try and stop me from being me.

I’m glad you made it out of this situation. I hope I don’t have to go through something similar.
Thank you for the kind words! Idk if this post will help anyone else, but it was nice to at least vent a bit. Moving forward, the best thing is we no longer have to hide who we are from anyone, and no more awful family gatherings! Last one I went to I lost like 5 pounds from anxiety induced nausea, which isn't something I've ever had before. I hope your wedding goes really well, and you get to wear whatever you want walking down the aisle!
Yeah, it probably does belong there, but I feel like this community might be able to relate to it as well. I don't think I've ever had someone hate me as vehemently as this woman does, so that's a new experience! We're locking our doors a lot more these days
Thanks for the award, btw! I don't think I've ever gotten one before, at least not one I know about, so that's pretty cool
Posting this to a non-trans sub will draw in the transphobes like vultures to a fresh carcass.
That is the harshest thing I've heard in a while but kinda deserved ngl.
Yeah, a psychiatrist said it sounds like she has some undiagnosed and untreated mental illness, but it's never good to diagnose second hand. Maybe this will cause her to get the help she needs, but probably not. That's her problem now, though!
I figure it'll be a few weeks/months before my heart rate stops skyrocketing every time there's someone walking past our house, but the relief from not having to deal with them will last forever!
Lol- kinda my thoughts as well, my wife had a point when she said that at least he was largely in control of his conduct and emotions, but I pointed out how low the bar is if being a slightly quieter bigot is all it takes to get praise.
My wife filed a police report yesterday, to basically do what you said and establish a record of her behavior. If something else does happen, hopefully that record will make any future legal actions easier. I don't plan on pursuing anything as long as she never comes back, but I'll still prepare!
My wife filed a report yesterday after we cooled off which was probably a good idea. I hope if/when you do end up having that conversation, they at least don't act violently!

One of my favorite parts of the conversation was when I described how the first time I met them, they were talking about how bs it was that the Confederate flag couldn't be flown above state capitol buildings, and her dad's response was that he didn't recall that event, but ""yeah, obviously we support it, we are conservatives"". I was like, yeah, so maybe you can see why we were hesitant to tell you guys at first?
One juicy bit I forgot to add, but you may appreciate. At one point, she gestured around us (to our house, flowers, plant stand, front yard, pride flag, etc) and asked, ""Does this look like happiness to you?"" My wife and I just laughed and were like, you mean living our lives in peace with friendly neighbors? Yeah, this definitely looks like happiness to us. She goes, ""well, it may look like that now, but give it time. Things can change!"" And I said, yes, HRT has been a lot of changes, and they've all been really positive! I've definitely become way happier, so I hope that change keeps on coming!
You're definitely right, it took some effort to not write a snarky text to her, but it's not worth stooping to her level.
That's the hope! Unfortunately that seems to be largely up to her, and she has nothing to do all day other than stew in her own anger, so idk what to expect. I know they own a gun, so I've got pepper spray strategically located throughout the house. Plus some fire extinguishers in case arson is afoot...
I was thinking this too, like how was mil able to text on the way home? Block block block
Oh, it was tough! Especially once I realized their main goal was to stop the wedding from happening, it just became so clear how impotent their rage was. Like, I couldn't help you if I wanted, it's too late. We already did the big gay
I agree, I am more shaken up by it than I thought I'd be, but it's definitely even more personal and tougher to process for my wife. It took my mom a while to come around, but her reaction was nothing like this, so I can only imagine how it feels when your own blood is saying things like that to you. We are helping each other as best we can, plus therapy, so I think we'll get through it!
I'm kinda wondering if I'll find some fresh paint on our house or cars. I'm pretty handy, so hopefully I can deal with any damage she tries to cause, but we did also set up a camera and we're locking the doors all the time now, and the dogs are on high alert!
Yeah, I've certainly considered it, but honestly idk if I can justify the cost at the moment. I did put pepper spray all over the house, plus our dogs are kinda scary, so I'm hoping that plus home field advantage will play in our favor. Plus she's got bad joints, so I think I've got her beat 100% if we take it to the ground
[deleted]
That was my wife's reaction as well, he definitely had some opinions of his own but managed to keep his cool. If he hadn't been there, I doubt she would have left so soon or so easily, so probably good that he was!
Wow, yeah, that's very intense! Honestly I just don't see where they get the energy to be so damn angry. Not caring is the easiest thing to do! I hope you don't have to deal with her, she sounds like a menace
You’re probably right tbh. I wouldn’t venture too far out of trans spaces with trans stories. Because there are a lot of people on Reddit who want to make our lives permanently miserable or worse.
Yeah unfortunately I've already seen that sub in particular side with bigoted parents of trans kids/adults and giving them all the unwarranted uwus of ""ooohh but it's a big change for them give them time,"" so I would definitely stear clear of posting this to other subs. Alas. It does have very r/justnomil vibes too tho lol. 

Anyways, proud of both you and your wife, OP. You did good.
If you don't have security cameras, now might be a good opportunity to install some and a setup to store footage so you can keep an eye on things both remotely and to have a paper trail in case the MIL escalates things or contacts some irrational male relatives to harass y'all.
NP, yinz earned that:)

Stay safe!
Too true! Can’t help people who don’t want to be helped.
Maybe some outdoor cameras would be a good measure? Then if they ever show back up again, just immediately call the cops. :( I’m sorry you’re in this hypervigilant state because of her craziness. That shit is the worst…
Yeah it really is a low bar. Though if nothing else, at least them each reacting in that way led to the conversation ending before it went further. Your FIL being quiet and perhaps a bit embarrassed probably saved you a lot of headache.

If they both flipped out things could get scary, and if they both tried to be quiet but condemning, you could be dealing with passive aggressive bs for weeks on end before it reached a boiling point.

Wish you guys luck and mad respect to your wife for standing up for herself, her decisions and for you. It's horrible what her parents are doing to her by making this an issue at all and it takes a good backbone to recognize it's them, not her, not you, in the wrong here.

Side note, I'd be super tempted to use the shards of those plates to make some cool artsy thing after painting them with trans colors just to spite your MIL. xP
Sounds like you handled everything the best way possible. Hopefully you’re done with that bs.
💖
Thats incredibly scary jesus christ. Id suggest buying a gun if you think they are that serious about harming u lile thay
“We already did *the big gay*”

My favourite Reddit quote to ever exist
Did you get to rub that in their faces?!? Oh I wish you had recorded their faces if so!! 

I'm so sorry lovely that this is happening. But you and your wife sound awesome and wonderfully supportive of each other. 💜
I would get a couple more cameras. The proof will help should anything happen.  Please stay safe!
You could install dummy cameras and motion sensor lights, those are cheap and can be enough to make someone think twice. Maybe reinforce the doors with a second deadbolt

Whoa! A yinzer! Have an Imp n Arn on me! 😁
I think it's a possibility, unlikely but plausible. I plan to tell the neighbors as well so they know what to look out for.
How did you make it MORE american
Yup. I’ve seen a lot of users experience that. I knew my my home state and town’s subs would be a toxic cesspit. So I don’t even bother. 

Too bad too. I’m sure I could meet a lot of wonderful queer people on there.

It's also a bad idea to frequent your home town subs on your main account (especially if you're queer) so that bigots can't pinpoint where you live

Saw this on Facebook. I'm not crying YOU'RE crying. 🏳️‍⚧️		"Exceptionally cute. Kudos to these loving parents.
I feel like artistic storytelling is one of the few cases where you can make an argument for changing pronouns based on time period. It helps convey the feeling of change. ofc if the story is about a real person you have to ask them if they are ok with it
the choice to change pronouns reads, to me, as artistic and representative. I can understand why some people would be put off by the wording but this poem spoke to me so much <3 I WAS ""she/her/daughter"" to my family for a long time. I don't have a need to erase that piece of me, and I like the idea that people can change even before fully understanding all the technical terms
Okay, I'm crying now.
The way they use “she” throughout the entire poem until the end is definitely controversial, but from a poetic perspective I like that they didn’t say “he” until in the poem they knew their son was in fact trans.
I love this 😭😭

Edit: tho I hope they asked him if it was ok to refer to the past one as a she, I mean I refer to pre-trans me as a he… so I didn’t think of that till I saw the comments lol
I know it's supposed to be supportive and stuff but I just don't like that they call their son ""she"" throughout the whole thing and calling him their daughter. Personally if my parents wrote something like this about me, I'd be more hurt by the fact that they'd keep calling me their daughter and stuff.
Hearts in the right place, but the words hit their mark.

 If you were gonna play the role of going through discovery, you should have changed daughter to son after he said he came out as a boy.
I thought this was transfem and I got extremely dysphoric, for some reason this was very difficult to wrap my head around. But it’s transmasc and ok
Whyyy!?!? Omfg, yall I JUST did my makeup. Why would you do this to me!? 😭😭
I'll accept that I'm crying but what kind of monster are you for not crying! 😭
Oh no! You're right I am crying 😭
BASED
I wish my parents were that supportive when they found out 😔
What a wonderful way of telling the story from the perspective of the parent while showing support. I love this!
I am. I am literally crying right now. Too much wholesome.
Oh Honey, That has brought tears to my eyes.  I wish my parents had loved me like that. I'm M2F. Thank You For Your Love....

Hugs and Kisses,

Michele
Absolutely beautiful and a true depiction of what parenting is supposed to be.
This is precious 💗 

I know everyone has different preferences when it comes to past referral of pronouns, but I am choosing to give this author the benefit of the doubt because the work is so enthusiastically supportive of their son. I don’t think it does us any favors to discourage this type of artistic expression. Happy for the parent that wrote this and the trans son they clearly love very much 🏳️‍⚧️
The parents are doing their best but their best is still sort of crappy.
I wish i had a female version to send to my mom
How is this good that person is a boy why they say girl this is disgusting
[removed]
I wish my family felt like this about me “becoming a boy” :(
Yes. I’m crying.
Fuck you I AM TOTALLY CRYING
I read through the whole thing before I realized it's a poem lmao.

This is very sweet and I love it!!!!
god, my mom when?
Great. Thanks. Now I’m crying 😭
SHUT UP NOW IM CRYING 😭😭
I’m gonna send this to my parents. Wish me luck😬
W parents
One of my aunts constantly says like my beautiful niece, and like every single time it like, almost makes me cry. I’ve been very lucky that I pass as cis One of my aunts constantly says like my beautiful niece, and like every single time it like, almost makes me cry. I’ve been very lucky that I pass as Cis but still when she says it still makes me almost cry because I still don’t 100% believe that I do pass she was like you look exactly like a woman
I'm crying.
yes I'm literally crying
Why am I crying
I sent this to my mom/the suportive parent and she cryed
my childhood and teen years in a nutshell
i dont cry much; i cried.
That is the cutest and wholesome thing I’ve seen today 🥰
My aunt is a man now...
I was reading along just kinda ""okay, okay, yeah"" and then the sudden and casual ""his"" made me immediately start crying.

Im at work, so rip, but yeah I think it was well done. I hope they asked their son if this was okay though
Yeah, this is exactly what I was thinking too
Oh me too. *passes the tissue box*
I wish I could cry...
It shouldn't be controversial. If I change my pronouns now, it doesn't retroactively change what my pronouns were then. People are just desperate to hate on wholesome shit
We have politicians calling for our literal genocide. I'm not going to split hairs over a cute poem in which these loving parents express both their lived experience of their son's transition before he came out *and* end it with their acknowledgement and acceptance of him.

For X amount of years they thought they had a daughter. I see nothing wrong with them symbolically (and very cutely) expressing that understanding and acceptance of their new reality in a poem that explicitly states their understanding of their son's transition, especially when we have people on this very sub who don't even get that much from the people in their lives.
My parents do it but only because I do it myself too. Before I came out, I refer to my “past self” as “she” because I was content as a girl then. People have different levels of comfort and tolerance about these things.
You have a point but 
A. It is a poem so it used to make it more story like
B. There are some trans people who when refering to them selves before any form of trans experience or realisation as their AGAB 
It all depends on perspective and the person 
~ apologies if this came as rude I am sure you are a great person I had no intention of being condescending just bring up something that I thought you may have skipped over
ok but tbf everyone’s comfort level is different, some people don’t mind being referred to with their AGAB pronouns for past tense
I felt htat way at first, but the more I think about it the more it reads as a changing of understanding.  The narrator gains in understanding over time until the end.
the last two lines properly gender him though, so I guess it was intentional?
If I use he/him for the first 20 years of my life, and start using she/her, then that doesn't retroactively make my pronouns always she/her. That isn't how time works
This also really bugged me, along with the 'our daughter' shit.

&#x200B;

Also feels very much like they are outting their kid ? does their son even know? :O  


I guess they are at least trying to be supportive though
The poem wouldn’t have the same impact if they referenced him correctly the entire time. Writing 101 lmfao. Time is conveyed.
its a way to show the change in their view for their son. viewing it from the perspective youre viewing it from is not the intended way to see it. though under conventional circumstance, using incorrect pronouns is awful, if you were to replace every she with a he or daughter with a son this card no longer makes any sense to the layman. it no longer presents as a pro trans card.
agreed, it just feels weird :(
Well luckily this isn’t about you
I think that's supposed to be a part of the experience of reading this poem. It's a bit of a bait and switch and has divided the room on its format and word choice (pronouns mainly) being acceptable.

imo this is creative and wholesome. I love it.
Yeah join the club
I give them a pass to use this kind of language in this artistic way. It's a poem not a bio. This like that convey an emotion from the parent's point of view. The kid might feel they were always a particular gender but this isn't their story. This is the parent experiencing a really intense transition of their own, and the pronoun usage captures it beautifully.

imo.
It's an artistic poem about a person's transformation and how their parents experienced it. It's not disrespectful.
Why?
It’s… uhhh… supposed to be touching that they misgender their trans son for the whole thing besides the end? But they support him so it’s okay! 🤮
Ah thats fair enough, I guess I wanted to play to both parties in the comments lol
I don't think people being a little bit triggered by something about a trans man that heavily uses she her is being desperate to hate on things.
What possessed you to start the comment with ""We have politicians calling for our literal genocide""? Like yes thats true but Jesus Christ. I was just expressing that *I* personally would be very hurt by this. Also *my* parents don't really understand or accept me transitioning, since that apparently matters in the context of me being uncomfortable with this and hurt if my parents were to do the same.
YOU have politicians calling for our literal genocide, but dont assume everyone is from where you are or if thats even related to this
It is intentional to show the parent’s changing understanding of their child over time
Yeah, let's assume the absolute worst out of this cute facebook poem.

Maybe they also beat their child with a hammer whilst writing the poem :O
Worst faith reading damn
The impact it has on me is that I am deeply uncomfortable
Yeah I’d maybe change the title to “our son was a girl” or something since it feels like they’re still trying to hold onto the idea of him being their daughter
This shouldn’t be triggering…
Which is why you shouldn't project yourself and your emotions onto situations that aren't yours. This particular poem is from the parents perspective thinking their child was one gender and then their child comes out. Once the child does come out they use he/him pronouns. The poem would have not read the same if they used he/him throughout, it wouldn't have been clear that the child is trans
I'd like to point out that you can shut up with that dumb comment. There's not likely many places in the world that won't try and genocide us right now. Don't try and act like wherever you are is so great. Mo ey says I can find a hate crime from the past year in your country.
Lol good luck finding one country that doesn’t hate our existence
My comment was about the writing..? The poem wouldn’t have the same meaning nor focus on time, change, and acceptance. I didn’t say it didn’t have an impact on you, but if you’re seriously upset over a wholesome poem then that’s a YOU issue and you need to grow some skin. (Clarification: If the POEM referred to him as he the whole time, it would be pointless and not make any sense)
Eh. Different strokes I guess. I'm biased. 

My 7yo daughter still calls me dad/daddy. It's been almost 2 years since I started properly trying to present differently. Only been using my name consistently for about a year. I'm the only one in the world that gets to call me something special that represents the bond we have. I tell her all the time that I totes feel mother-like so that's how I feel and identify. But idk I just can't not let her stick with saying dad. It's fucking weird to process but she's happy for me and actually really fucking digs me being trans. ""My daddy is the prettiest girl"" just melts my heart with how confident and proud she is to say it to people. And I'm somehow immune to literally anyone's outside opinions on the matter because hers is the only one I care about.
[deleted]
I doubt that there are any places that are perfect, but rn not sure there are too many non-third world places that are as fucked up as the USA right now
So I'm not allowed to have feelings and express them? Also your comment wasn't really that clear so I responded to it with how I interpreted the comment. People are allowed to have different experiences and feelings, to me this just is not a wholesome poem. I'm not gonna start hiding my feelings just cause some random person on reddit thought I was too sensitive.
Yeah I guess so. I’d still refer to myself pre-egg cracking as a boy, and I think it adds extra comedy to “when I was a boy”.
Doable sure, but a completely different poem. Other trans people have other experiences and some do refer to themselves with old pronouns when talking about before they came out/before they knew they were trans/etc. Like all I'm saying is that this is a poem and a story not a real life account
Literally grow up mate. You’re twisting my words to fit a personal mindset of “everything sucks and everyone is against me.”
Excuse you? Weren't you the one telling me to ""grow some skin"", stop projecting dude.
Define projecting because?? I’m not the one crying over people being accepting here. We’re facing genocide and you’re upset over a poem. Grow. Up. This is why we’re called snowflakes.. some of y’all here are upset over being ACCEPTED!"	1216x6e	trans	2424	0.99	2023-03-25 02:00:04
trans rage	"i don't think we talk about this enough, if at all. it's almost like trans people aren't allowed to be angry, yet a significant part of my experience has been characterized by anger. facing transphobia has almost never made me ""sad"" in the way society likes to portray queer people to be - i am not going to cry if you misgender me, i will rip you to shreds, or at least wish i could. 

i have developed a pretty thick skin after being out for years in a still very transphobic country, honestly, but having to face the same shit over and over and over again, nearly every single day, i honestly don't have the words to describe how infuriating it is.

and at the end of the day? i'm still expected to be the one educating people and ""being patient and understanding"" if they don't get it. fuck that, and fuck you. i should not have to explain my identity to every single person that interacts with me. i should not have to put up with being misgendered and outed because ""you just can't understand the concept"". living in a cis society is so. fucking. exhausting."	"I feel the same. I don’t want people to use my anger to think that trans men are violent, as those who stand against us think our “evil testosterone” makes us bad people or something.
I definitely feel like if I get angry, people are going to tell me, “how very like a MAN of you!”
Fuck being sad, we should be full of rage.
Yes. rage has characterized my experience far more than sadness post-transition. I got sir'd by a huge group, ignored them, then they all kept shouting sir at me, trying to get my attention. My tits are so obvious, def presenting femme, and there they are just sirring their hearts out. I cursed their entire family line. Sorry / not sorry.
Feel the same way with my parents my parents are openly transphobic and I bought a dress and they both yelled at me called me spiteful and disrespectful and they took my phone luckily I was able to get it back to see this lol
I've got anger issues so its even worse when people make me feel like the stereotypical trans woman
I get pissed off but I never let em know that. I just give em the “are we really doing this right now?” Look cuz that’s all the space in my mind I’ll give em
Doesn't help that I'm autistic and have meltdowns. Thankfully I've never been around a non-accepting person when they happened
This is it my queers the post i have been searching for years. I'm an anarchist queer trans woman and i have always said i dont need to pass for no mother fucking body nor do i need to fit the status quo of what you think us trans women should be. I pass as myself and i will be respected or your ass cussed the fuck out. i have called people whiny bitches who don't like the fact i am defiantly me and will remain the woman i know i am. I don't put up with misgendering or being fetished or only like cause cis men see me as an experiment no honey bunny dummy i am a whole as experience and a beautiful one. the woman i am you can never find because you can't search for this monument.

Bless you for this real post we have needed. I love you for being you i know you are exhausted but please rest and don't let the bastards get you down. much love and shalom always.
We won't be ""allowed"" to be angry until we're considered equals. As of current, the underlying idea is still that cishets *allow* us to exist in public and *grant us* respect/basic human decency, but have the power to retract that at any point.

It's the same as with gay people, with black people, with women, and will be the same with disabled people once trans people have some basic rights established and that'll be the ""new"" big social topic - not in the sense of ""we move from one thing to the next"", but as in ""the next thing white cishet progressives decide to grant a voice"".

The idea that we're lesser is what allows them to do the tone policing - if we were the ""higher""/more socially accepted party, we'd be the one able to tone police transphobes while them not being anything but kind to us in public would lead to public outcry.

That being said, not to incite anything, but it's not like the marginalised groups i mentioned above got their rights by being peaceful and not getting in their oppressors' way, so...
I am incredibly angry all the time about this exact same shit.
You know there is a statistical tendency where ppl with lower income tend to be more social

And ppl with more money just tend to go the opposite way

Bc they have the option to not deal with ppl when they dont want to

We seem to generally avoid ppl when we have the option

Like ppl are building guarded societies and stuff to keep all those idiots out and not having to deal with them

Like we have the social value of


Everyone matters and is valuable


But it seems a lot of ppl seem to be not as striking to ppl when they have the option, and they still do fine without them


Like thats a statistical generalisation, still

I remember some rapper beeing like

""i really want to support the ppl in my old shit neighbourhood, but they just keep stealing my shit""


Same as area for me as

""Democracy assumes a informed population ""


Like we are not gonna say anything explisit

But like ppl seem st be sht
That's a pretty good observation. I can't say what the FtM experience of that would be, but as an MtF person, I definitely feel what you're saying.

It's like on the one hand women are socially conditioned not to show anger. And growing up as a closeted trans person, nevertheless I subconsciously absorbed and tried to follow a *lot* of female-coded social conditioning.

But on the other hand, testosterone. And anybody who says T doesn't shorten your fuse and put your anger on a touchier trigger, well, they don't know what the F they're talking about.

And on the third hand, the constant paradoxes that being trans subjects you to are genuinely infuriating, so there's a lot of anger to be had. As much as you want, and none of which you feel you're allowed to express. Even if you wanted to, which you probably don't, but it's there anyway.

And it's going to come out one way or the other. You can't keep it all bottled up forever. 

In this bind of having rage that I was not permitted to show, I had to let it out in private. I punched a lot of walls when nobody was around. And, here's your PSA for the day, I don't recommend it. I went through years in college where my right hand pretty much always hurt. I'm certain that I fractured and hairline cracked several bones in that hand, which never really got the chance to heal before the next wall-punch came along.

Don't be like me. Don't punch walls. I'm way older now, and I can tell you, you don't want to get to my age regretting the arthritis and chronic pain you're going to have to endure for the rest of your life in your punching hand, even though you kicked the wall-punching habit years and years ago, knowing that it's your own damn fault for doing that damage in the first place.

But if you're here reading this, you're already ahead of that game. The rage didn't start to go away until I figured out I'm trans and could start processing these feelings in an accurate context for once. If you're here then you know you're trans, so you can go down a better path than I did.
YES. The one that super gets me is that sometimes the CIS will come and comment or post in a queer space like this and if anyone says ANYTHING other than ""ooohhh poor baby! Let me teach you you perfect star child, thank you for just being here!"" Then it's the queer folk who get dogpiled for not coddling. I'm all for education and for not being cruel, but holy shit sometimes people need to be told that they just need to do better and that anger doesn't seem to be allowed.

Here’s an essay about Trans rage I think y’all might communicate with, if meant a lot to me
I like this energy of yours, which I share myself. Being a femme trans girl, is not going to stop me from cursing the sh\*t out of myself, if I come across a degenerate bigot.
I get what you mean. Then we are told ""just go somewhere more accepting"". Like do they realize that they are defending bigotry? I hate society
I just get cold and calculating anymore.  I don't get sad or mad, I think ""what's the quickest way to get me away from this person that would cause the least drama?""  They don't deserve my anger or sadness.  I just want them to leave me alone.
I have spent so much time being angry (or in fight or flight) since coming out. I discovered my family members, who said they would support me no matter what are actually incredibly transphobic/homophobic, and I’m afraid of being a hate crime stat. anytime I am out in public when I dress or present how I feel most comfortable and my authentic self. I am tired of it. I hear you, and I’m so sorry. I am of the mindset that rage is part of the “experience”. It helps me remember there’s something we’re fighting for, and that the world is changing. It gets exhausting not yelling at or swinging at transphobic people, though.
This is true words. I haven't been trans long but the entire time its been nothing but anger.
I completely agree. Dealing with ignorance and bigoted people on a daily basis is so tiring and it makes me so annoying, angry and disappointed. I hate it so much, but I can’t do anything because no one likes to take trans people (and queer people in general) seriously.
My least favourite thing of all is when you express the anger/frustration and Cis friends say something along the lines of “nobody’s going to listen if you’re angry” - if your being an ally has conditions, then you’re not an ally. I am not about to reject the identity that society assigned me against my will only to “fit” into THEIR comfortable narrative of what a “good trans” is. 

This is MY life, MY existence, MY experience, and I’m not about to abandon my identity that I worked so hard to be able to have in order to appeal for a superficial “ally” if you’re an ally you’re an ally, no strings attached, no conditions, no expectations for us to adhere someone else’s narrative.
I think our brutal and unrelenting rage needs to be shown. I mean I've literally used Commander Erwin's charge speech when expressing my rage and talking with other trans folk.
while education is important, NO ONE should be *expected* to educate people and feel like they need to justify their existance to people, and that they need to be patient and understand. fuck that. 

personally, sometimes I feel like I'm in a good enough place to try and help people understand, and sometimes its too much for me to even try when I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking at the seams and I want to just be myself. My experience has been largely sadness but a good ammount of anger too. dunno what else to say but yeah.
There need to be safe and understanding places to just VENT OUT ALL THE FRUSTRATION WITH EVERYONE AROUND YOU.

Be patient and understanding, everyone's patience has its limits, nobody has infinite patience and you are expecting too much from trans people. Nobody's a f\*\*\*\*\*\* saint. And when trans people get tired and overwhelmed (like normal humans) people make it a much bigger deal.

This honestly also goes for sexual minorities, racial minorities, disabled people, any type of minority. There should be spaces where you're just allowed to scream and vent without being judged for it.

Or how people don't understand the difference between venting and actual hate. Sometimes you just want to scream how cis people are unbearable, but you do it after an awful interaction and you need to get it out of your system. That's not hate, that's actually necessary for a healthy mind. Vomiting the anger out of you is healthier than keeping it inside.

Mental health is stigmatized and misunderstood. Add transphobia on top of that and it's a mess. I'm really glad the trans subreddit has a ""vent"" tag because that is so very needed in this environment.
It’s unfortunately the price we have to pay for doing nothing other than be our authentic selves
I mean, those are the kind of emotions that start protests, and protests get us rights, so no complaints here.
I feel the same way makes me want to commit arson on their st**id ass
I’ve gotten pretty vengeful towards the right wingers since coming out as MTF. I never realized how hard they try to actually stop us from existing
I feel the same way. I live in the states; Texas specifically. I am misgendered every day by my own mother and some of my own friends. I infuriates me and yet I have to be patient. I am lucky enough to be in a very tolerant high school with a lot of fellow trans/queer teens. But I'm still in the southern U.S we're I can be discriminated against just be cause I want to be a girl, or because I like guys and girls. I still have to be patient, I still have to be educating, and I still have to keep a lid on my temper. Because I know that is even one trans kid blows up at a transphobic cis person than the entire trans community could be cracked down on, and it could give the GOP the ammunition they need to start hunting us down like animals.
I agree, if someone doesn't understand than whatever, how hard is it to understand I'm a person with a gender. Treat me like a person, if it confuses you that's because you're overthinking it or looking at it wrong. I don't need a whole interaction explaining why I exist.
100% agree I can’t stand it either
I completely agree, I'm non-binary and pan, I live in the Netherlands and it's not that transphobic or homophobic around me but still having to even explain that there's more then 2 genders is indeed exhausting. One of my previously friends couldn't understand aroace boyfriend - boyfriend relationships and it's so aggravating that some people don't even try to understand like it's a puzzle they can't solve but disrespecting all of us affected, we're not the ones that should educate us, people assigned to should so frig those extra math exercises and teach people about us.
I feel this so much my community is so toxic about anything around gender identity and sexualities to the point that me coming out has cause me to be unable to get a job where I live and has made life a living hell, I’m only 18 and recently decided to tell everyone who picks on my for my large breasts that I identify as male and they can leave me alone or face the consequences but now because I stood up for myself I can’t make money to fucking survive!!
I totally feel this way. Take my upvote
“have a thicker skin!” 
*does that*
“you should feel more like a normal person!”
:/
i have like almost no emotions anymore because ive learned to accept like everything to the point the only emotion i really feel is happiness and stress
Hugs!!
Exactly, and I’m not allowed to be angry or they call me a man or something of that nature. Hell, I have it so beat into my brain that if I get angry and dare show it, I feel bad because I feel like I’m not giving off feminine vibes or something. I completely agree, I’m so sick of living amongst so many cis people who expect so much out of me and us as a group of people
i am thankful that my BPD rage and trans rage haven't decided to hold hands. i fear what i would do if they did.
A great essay at least tangentially connected to this is Susan Stryker’s “My Words to Victor Frankenstein above the Village of Chamounix: Performing Transgender Rage”
When I came out to my parents as a trans man, my mom tried to blame it on period hormones. It should be socially acceptable to beat the shit out of transphobes.
One thing that really makes my blood boil is how cis people justify their tranphobia and shitty behaviour with “I don’t understand these things” AS IF it were a valid excuse, as if they couldn’t just respect someone regardless of their understanding. And then when you give them attitude, suddenly you’re the one who’s not cooperating, they go “I’m trying SO hard how dare you be so mean to me” fuck that. Parents misgendering and deadnaming their trans children because “it will take some time to get used to it” fuck that, it’s a fucking pronoun you dumbass bitch, get over it.
We always have to be the ones to have patience, understanding, stay calm, give people time to “settle” while they treat us like fucking garbage, fuck that, I’m so over it
I remember when I was still entertaining the idea of having my highly religious cishet grandparents in my life, I'd told them in 2019 and progress was incredibly incredibly slow and could be taken away in an instance; the final nail in the coffin for me was them telling me I ""can't wear a dress or be called Rae or she/her/they/themed"" at my great grandmothers funeral, apparently it was because ""there will be people who don't understand there and we don't you to be upset"" because apparently being furious at how both she and my grandfather tried to manipulate the family into ""getting along"" when one side was abusers and the other victims and being angry at being misgendered by them both constantly was me being ""sensitive""; despite all this I went in a dress like top and leggings, but found out I could've wore a dress because my Gran straight up said ""I really don't care"" about the whole situation she'd invented up for me and then tried her best to ignore for a solid two weeks. I tried one more time after that to get them on the same page, but was told (as I always seemed to be by them) that ""We're not from your generation and God said there is only men and women"" and that I should ""understand"" and ""respect"" their position in all this despite only one of us having actual mental harm from the treatment of the other.  


Anyway the long winded moral of this story is cishet people can thrive up their own arse all day and the instant we even show a slight grimace at their treatment they can jump out of their arses to bellow about how we're being rude for not ""respecting"" them; hopefully one day none of us will have to deal with their shit.
I’m reminded of Shovda, a trans Mario streamers. They are *extremely angry* when a level is pissing them off.

“I’m not good at maker anymore, but I will be good for five minutes to spite your ass. That’s what’s you’re getting (Carl), spite-fuelled fuckin’ trans rage.”
I had to stop E because of financial problems and when all the T came back, I did and still do get angry about stuff. My family are “supportive” but think I need to see a “real” doctor about my emotions.
""If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry."" — Satoshi Nakamoto
These transphobes are a bunch of whiny bitches who cry at the notion that someone has pronouns. It's time to grow the fuck up and stop digging your nose into how someone else lives their life. They need to live as they preach and stop getting offended over my existence, you don't see me obsessing over what the fuck is in your pants.
Wait, who says we can't be mad. Im mad all the time. Anger is one of the only feeling i have left!
Whoa, this is SUPER topical! Just this morning I heard a [story on NPR](https://www.wesa.fm/arts-sports-culture/2022-05-09/scholar-says-many-trans-people-are-discouraged-from-publicly-expressing-a-full-range-of-emotions) about a Sal Malatino's new book *Side Affects: On Being Trans and Feeling Bad*. From the story:

>But like anyone else, trans people experience a range of emotions, including negative feelings from fatigue and anger to envy and burnout. It’s just that, as Malatino argues in a new book, most are discouraged from expressing them publicly.
I'm usually okay with questions but have 'Im not a tutorial' days
I just want to be happy I want to get gender affirming surgeries yet I have to go through a shit ton of things to be happy it's seriously not fair
Exactly. Every time I get misgendered the people who know it look at me like ""oh nooo, Im so sorry for u"" 
No. Fuck that. I'm not about to cry, I'm about to make them cry.

The only simple thing people need to understand about trans people is that we are human beings. What do human beings need? To take your rights/genders/kids away? No. We just fucking want respect. If someone doesn't respect me, Im gonna get angry. I hate people that say shit like ""if you want me to respect you you have to earn it"" like fuck no. Respect is a human right you absolute fuck. Admiration is earned. 
I am angry, I am mad, and I am very, very upset.
FtM (23) and still not on hormones yet. This was a year ago when I finally started learning how to be assertive and advocate for myself. I don't remember what exactly I said, but I stood my ground against my mom and her reaction was to ask me if I had started taking testosterone without telling her. Like for starters, it's none of her f*cking business. And no, as it turns out I'm perfecting capable of metaphorically growing a pair without the help of hormones. 
But yeah, not even anger or agression. Just an ounce of assertiveness and people want to start demonizing trans people and hrt.
cis ally here to tell you that you're just as human as everyone else, and I don't expect you to hide your emotions. i hope i didn't say anything offensive.
Can the revolution start already?
Here's what one African-American writer said about the burden of ""explaining"" racism to white people.  By no means am I equating racism and transphobia; nevertheless, I think the sentiment applies to trans people, too.

>Day after day, year after year, one swallows the   
taste of bile over seemingly minor incidents that cannot be discussed   
lest one be regarded as rude. Then suddenly there is a need to talk, to   
know how one feels and have things explained? No can do.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/08/black-friends-educate-racism/
this really hits home bc like fr? and there aren’t any gsa at my school or anything so i gotta stay quietly angry while being misgendered and having intense dysphoria
Wanna create a country called The Kingdom of Trans? Cause same
Black Dresses, if you want some banger trans rage
I had an experience with someone I was going to work with that wanted to make sure I wouldn’t get super angry and defensive if being misgendered. Like what?  You cannot police my emotions! And do cis people not understand that the anger comes from PAIN!? Pain from dysphoria, a strict gender roled society, transphobia, etc. so of course I’ll emote! I was so shocked.
Me too, I'm stealth in my every day life but I'm so outspokenly trans online and angry. I feel like my strength all these years come from hatred and anger. I hate most cis people I interact with because they have no clue what it's like, and if they guess that I'm trans or knew that I am they're always ignorant and inconsiderate. My ex that I was with for three years would constantly bring up sex even though he knew it made me uncomfortable. Tried to justify it because he's horny 🥴 and he hasn't had sex blah blah blah, I'm poly for a reason I don't want to do anything until I'm fully transitioned and in debt. It's so aggravating to simply exist sometimes.
I read somewhere once, when I started to recognize my anger, that being angry was a good thing because it meant that I expected better. It's so much easier to wrap my head around being angry at a specific person, making amends or finding closure with one person seems relatively attainable. Being angry at transphobia on the whole is so much harder.

I don't want to ""pass"", I've never felt joy in ""passing"". But 2 years into my transition, I recognize that it makes it a little more bearable to live in tiny ways. I hate that it gives me the privilege of invisibility.

A lot of the things I want to see for trans people everywhere may not come in my lifetime. I don't know what to do with my rage on the days when I've already done all that I can to explain or argue or fight.
It's the ""expected to be patient and understanding"" bit that pisses me off the most. 

It makes me so angry because I could literally show the TINIEST SHRED of very mild annoyance about, say, a parent continually misgendering me and suddenly every person under the fucking sun has to tell me to show them grace and kindness and support. Like I FUCKING AM YOU DICKHEAD. God forbid I complain just a TINY BIT outside of ear shot from my parents anyway!!! 

You get so much shit for expecting the basic human respect all cis people get handed automically. It's ridiculous. I don't even show outward anger but I sure as fuck feel it a lot of the time. I hate it because I DO show UNBELIEVABLE patience and understanding to people who 100% do not deserve it but the second I step a tiny bit out of line it's ""why are you so angry!! They're TRYING!!!"" fuck off. Seriously, fuck off. I'm so sick of it.
""Have you ever thought about how YOUR transition would make US feel?""

First of all, mum, do you really think I haven't thought about it? Do you really see me as such a selfish person that I wouldn't even CONSIDER your point of view? I have kept in mind the consequences of my identity for way longer than you could ever imagine. The fact that I decided to take action and actually do something should make you proud of how BRAVE I am, not make you think that I do it to piss you off.

And, secondly, I shouldn't. I shouldn't have to think of your pain about this because you shouldn't EVEN feel it. You shouldn't see me as ""your lost daughter"", or as the source of your suffering, because I am not causing it to you. I haven't done a single thing to hurt you, I have just been myself and I am so, SO TIRED of having to justify it.
Cis people: misgenders, berates, in some cases, physically engages us, pass laws to keep us down, and generally are dicks to us

Us: hey you're kind of an asshole

Cis people: Woah there, calm down, don't attack me you violent [slur]. It's obviously all that testosterone in your system
I called out my friend, pissed but not sad, when he said some really inappropriate transphobic things as a joke (I don't fault him, he genuinely didn't understand the significance of what he was saying and I've since helped him to understand) and instead of acknowledging that what he did was wrong or that my feelings were valid he just kinda awkwardly was like ""it's okay if you don't wanna be friends anymore"". Which idk how to explain it but that was him avoiding the topic, not acknowledging it
This anger has only been building since I came out to myself and a few friends. And now I’m like, fuck this I’m going to start E even if only out of spite alone.

And then I go introvert mode and can’t assert myself for shit. Just ahhhhhh.
UGH I feel this. With stuff like having to be Google for people, I try to approach it all with grace and be like ""well, public education fails to teach this stuff, I'll give this person benefit of the doubt and appreciate their asking"" but it definitely uses mental energy especially since I know that if I did blow up, all of a sudden this person's singular interaction with a trans person is a negative one.

For me the worst holding back is getting misgendered and wanting to correct people. That ""it's maam"" video always pops up in my brain and stops me from speaking up, even if the person isn't trying to be mean.

It's hard to explain the feeling of being misgendered, because --at least for me-- it's not quite sad or angry or anything. Mostly it's exhaustion. ""what more do I have to do??""
One book that did this really well was Dreadnought by April Daniels. The main character, Danielle, is an angry person. Not in that she's constantly violent, or wrathful, but in that there's this constant, pervasive feeling of anger that just seems to simmer under her skin. She's sick and tired of everyone else's bullshit, and when the opportunity to be herself comes along, she takes it for all it's worth and basically dares everyone else to come and take it from her.
Yeah, we are treated like second class citizens but have no outlets to express the rage. The result is just going around feeling terrible all the time. I honestly don't know what to do about this. Sending strongly worded tweets feels inadequate, and we don't really have a militant organization. We only have underfunded non-profits that don't take a hard line against transphobia.
There's a huge stigma towards many groups of marginalized people, that they aren't allowed to be outspoken, aren't allowed to be angry, etc. and if they are, they're heavily looked down upon

It's the condescension of the majority
i think of myself as a trans person who's full of roiling rage. Im full of vicious, searing anger and fury for myself and for my trans siblings. Calling out transphobes aint enough i want them dead. I want them to suffer. I want transphobes to feel the pain they cause us ten times over. I want them to beg and plead for their miserable lives at the feet of every murdered trans person. I see stories of trans women being murdered and i want the killers to suffer the most agonizing of deaths and to experience what they give out. I want to tear down transphobic and hateful laws and all the other bullshit that society enforces to try and eradicate us. I want transphobes to see me and feel fear, i want them to know if they dare try and do anything to me that i will fucking break their bones for their choice of being transphobic. I want conservative/hateful right wing people to be intimidated by me. I want to protect and defend all trans people with the righteous fury of the gods. I wanna be that obviously queer guy at pride whose presence comforts the marginalized, and scares the bigots off from trying anything hateful. And i wanna have the physical strength and weaponry to defend anyone who needs it. I want to utterly destroy the colonizer transphobic society that would gladly see us all dead. I want to raze it to shreds and eradicate it and make a better world for everyone.
Don't forget the ""it's MA'AM!!"" jokes you fucking hear every single time you stand up for yourself.

Fucking disgusting.
Fuck yes. Fight.
You can't be patient and understanding with everyone you encounter who doesn't believe that you are who you are. That who you are isn't real, that it is made up. 

I am not trans, I can only know how frustrating it is having your existence minimised from my experience with autism, through the less common people thinking I am not because I can hold a conversation, or through the minimisation of sensory issues. 

I can also very much understand the difference in the levels between these things. If I was trans I would not be able to deal with people. I already struggle with the comparatively pervasive in our society, but much less of a danger to my being, and much less of an affront to who I am. Having my sensory issues not considered ruins my day, fighting back against transphobia can run a great risk, being autistic doesn't put me at an increased risk for violence or sexual assault. 

People who say openly bigotted things, and then ask you to act with decorum, as if politely saying that you should be arrested for using the bathroom in accordance to the fact you identify as a woman, or saying that teaching kids of trans people's existence is predetory, or actively misgendering someone don't waive the expected decorum of a conversation the moment that the statements come out of their mouths.

They breach the social contract in almost every way but because they fulfilled one clause, acting polite despite their vitreol, they think that you as a trans person should be forced to act polite as well, and to uphold everything they disregarded.
As a kid I always internalized this one anime villain's thing about him not showing anger and just being cold so I don't think I've ever got this problem, people just act intimidated by me lol

But it really is odd how online people misgender me on purpose and act like I'm going to have a meltdown while in reality I care more about the speck of dirt outside
my thoughts go something like this.

""it's not my fault you're stupid, and if you've got questions that don't concern you, then it's not my problem.

If you want to be an ally just change the pronouns, don't judge for being a klutz, and just stay out of the way unless you're going to actually help.""

Usually I just keep my mouth shut, but I just wish others could do the same...
100% feel the same and yeah, a lot of us are just...very mad. And why wouldn't we be? This is totally reasonable. It's exhausting to live in a cissexist, traumatizing society where cis ppl can't even google. When I came out as transmasc, then the questions started. And they basically never stopped. Slap on the transphobia and seeing my peers in pain, scared, it's just a lot?

Of course a lot of us are angry.
I feel this today. Yesterday I came out as a trans man to my parents.
They both refuse to use the right pronouns and my dad told me to ""Never talk to me about this shit again. Do whatever you want with your life, but don't bring me into that stuff.""

Ok dad, one day you and my mom won't be in my life at all.
My two brothers who accepted me and my sister in law will because they aren't transphobic assholes.

I left for work in the morning and when I corrected my mom she said ""Don't say that"" and ""You'll always be my daughter""

I'm so glad I came out because I know that their fucking priorities aren't to love me. There is no unconditional love. I'm so mad and I'm so angry right now.

I honestly feel like crying too though even though part of me knew they wouldn't love the real me.
C’est la vie what can you do
Not having the space to feel frustrated or angry without people blaming hormones or some other important aspect of the trans journey has made me feel like the most crazy individual. Never been gaslighted so hard. 

Before T, if I argued with my mum I was seen as too sensitive and easily shut down. Now (after T) she throws words out like hostile, mansplainer, mental, and has threatened to call the cops because T makes me out of control. (What am I the fucking Hulk?) 

The amount of times I’ve picked up on how wording pre-T and now has changed whenever I show any ounce of frustration is insane. I’m one of the most emotional hate conflict people I know and testosterone hasn’t changed that.
absolutely, it does make me sad, but much much more it makes me want to break every object in sight
FUCK YEAH, LET'S START A *FIRE*

(in a legally allocated place, around which we civilly discuss our frustrations, perhaps raising our voices and using expletives to enhance the mood :3 )
Imagine living in a genderless world?
You'll be treated like if you weren't female or male. Just nothing and everyone is like that... except you.

I'm not trying to shoot you, maybe this day I'm not so patient and have NO FILTERS, because in a sense, I feel like you. I hate to explain even to other trans folks what the F am I.

Many assume I'm like them (i.e., drags, transvestites) l and I'm mistreated by those who claim all the time to be the only ones to be prosecuted marginalized and pissed off.

I'm effing tired of them also. You see, not only you is pissed off today.

Just fuck this world and everyone assuming being trans is a *sexual thing*.

PS: edited fucking typos.

i find it alienating even in trans communities. like peopoe get upset when i get angery about them using the q word like in this post while it has no spoiler. it makes me hurt and people still use it
I do get that - and to be honest, it’s entirely understandable. However, anger is practically never the best solution to anything; all it tends to do is spread more anger than actually help.
I 100% agree
I use ti be angry all the time until I started HRT now I'm sad all the time lol
I feel the same.
Yes!
It's just a way to stereotype and invalidate you. Same as the 'gay rage'. No norval person would use it.
I’m not even fully out yet and I feel like a bomb
Like it or not, we are emissaries of our minority status. It is both a blessing (opportunity) and a curse (albatross).

It’s not fair. It’s never fair. But we can use it as an opportunity to be ambassadors for change.
it makes me so angry that i’m not allowed to be angry lmao
hm. i suppose thats reasonable. personally i could never transfer nor. cut my hair much or anything (ftm, family has always refused to let me cut my hair. also too broke to even think of transitioning oet alone a simple haircut unless i do it myself lol) 
so i can't say i understand this much besides the phobia as a general. it always seemed a bit nonsensical to me. 
like confusion is one thing but i mean were all human . yknow - i never even understood the 'testosterone evil raa' . seems a bit cruel to group people like that  . everyone has at least some testosterone . thats just life . i hope it gets better for yall though
Yes... 👏
Trans lives matter. I hope society can do better for y’all. The abortion issue language is also anti-trans. How hard is it to say “people who can get pregnant “ instead of “women.” The bulk of the legislation early this year (in the US) has been anti trans/trans erasure. It’s all going the wrong direction…
I feel you, I live with rage, It's been with me since I was an angry teenager and felt that something was wrong but couldn't figure what yet. The only advice I can give you is to find something to channel it in a positive way, for me it was music, music literally saved my life. For you could be something different, some activity, a sport, art, videogames, whatever that let's you channel all that bad energy in a safe way.
I saw a comment on another post talking about a time where someone was talking shit about trans people in front of them, and they didn’t want to say anything or else be seen as “that one angry trans person” 

Like, BE mad! Is that not a natural response to being shit talked? Let them know you’re not taking any shit. Don’t allow them to think that they can just say whatever.
same
If your testosterone makes you evil, then half of the world's people are evil. Damn, even everyone since cis women have testosterone too (although not that much)
I know this is supposed to be a serious thread, but how do i get the bi and trans flag on my profile? 

Im on mobile
And if I get angry I'm an ""emotional woman."" There's no winning.
I actually got very mad at a karen in my apartment and she said that exact thing i honestly wanted to tear her appart
I always read something about trans women letting their man self out whenever they're angry. Fuck that
Just the other day Joanne had a tweet calling out someone that put a sticker over a TERF flier that had colored knives that said ""TERFS weaponize the patriarchy against transfemmes by telling them what women should be.""

Her tweet was ""you can always tell a real woman by the pretty rainbow way she draws knives."" 

It's just so gross.
And if you're a trans man you get accused of roid raging. And some people really think testosterone and steroids are the same thing. My dad is supportive but even he believed that for almost two years of my transition because of all the deliberate misinformation spread especially during the Olympics.
Is that what it is? I never put two and two together that my breakdowns might be related to my being on the spectrum. I know you didn't intend to help but this actually helps quite a bit. Thank you
Its often said that you should try to be civil, to try and help people to learn about you and your existence, to understand it. To try and aid the ignorant in learning and to dissuade the bigotted through niceties and through setting a good example.

But not everyone can do that. And not everyone should. 

If people are unwilling to learn about how and why a significant group of people exist on their own time, that is their problem. You shouldn't have to walk someone through why you should be allowed to just exist and why your existence isnt a problem.

And frankly, the bigotted will find ammo regardless of whether or not you shout them down or enact violence. If you act nice, they often just think you are one of the good ones, and think that your quality as a person is in spite of who you are. If you act dismissive, they will just make stuff up about you. 

Bigottry is not a smart pattern of though, and it is often reinforced by equally stupid things. At least if someone is publically shamed or smacked, then the stupid thought process of ""if I say this stuff this might happen again"" will kick in and their bigotted asses will be careful next time.

To add, you do not have to pass, and should not have to pass in order to be trans. Its not relevant to what I have to say, but I want to say it so here it is.
thank you, will definitely check this out myself
yes! i was just going to comment the same thing lol
100% agreed. when all else fails, queer rage will force change to occur. no assimilation!
To quote Sheev Palpatine: “Let the hate FLOWWWWWW through you!”
That's the second time this week someone has recommended this piece, so I HAD to look it up:)

Click on [Click here to read this text](https://transreads.org/my-words-to-victor-frankenstein/) at the top of the page.
I call them I'm not Google days.
amazing idea
i love their music!!!!
queer has been a word used by this community for years, i beg you to educate yourself on the history before deciding it's a dirty word.
You joke, but a large number of people unironically believe this
Like for real i cant be angry as a trans women or shithead transphobes will tell me i act too manly...
A lot of people drank the gender essentialist koolaid from TERFs and unironically spout those views that demonize trans masculinity. For trans men, us taking T is basically like ultra-doping that makes us angry, violent rage machines and unworthy of support/basic kindness.
I used to identify as a cis woman (AFAB nonbinary person here, she/her) and my behaviors make me think I've got more testosterone than cis women usually do.
I go to a trans support group.  I much prefer being around other trans people.  I kind of wish there was a neighborhood in my metro area where lots of trans people lived so I could move there.
Yeah I definitely feel like I’m not allowed to get angry.
She’s obsessed.  It’s like half of her tweets.
Well as MtF I’ve been on testosterone and this has caused anxiety and anger and I was very easy to start rage. So it’s maybe better working in male brain, but for my female brain it was just terrible experience, I cannot go back on T ever.
Aspergerexperts.com have a great webinar called Deep into Defense Mode - it explains that people on the spectrum freeze first, then when they thaw out they go into fight or flight, either acting out or running away.  They also teach that people on the spectrum *need* safe people and safe places, to be *able* to calm down again, far more than neuro typical people.
it’s hurtful and makes me want to cry. i don’t use >!transexual!< because it hurts others and wish this was respected the same
Oh... I don't want to believe that but I'm sure your right, considering how some people are...
Yeah, a lot of TERF's and 2nd-wave feminist types demonize men and masculinity. When that hurts trans people, it's transphobia.

One reason I like the trans communities on Reddit because they're generally positive and affirming about gender. If someone is MTF, they can be affirmed. If someone is FTM, they can be affirmed. If someone is non-binary, that's cool too. Good feelings for everyone.
my dad said ""not very ladylike"" when i got angry about something

those words felt like a thousand thorns (less now, because he's a transphobe, but y'know)
That's so sad. People generally don't seem to take women seriously which is also another issue

We all have the right to feel emotions but transphobic people will always use anything to invalidate both trans men and women :(
trans exclusionary ""feminists"" explaining how women aren't allowed to speak out of turn because that's rude
There's always the gayborhood in Philly if you're eillimh to relocate. I mean, for all I know you already live in Philly, so maybe it's not really relocating. Either way, at least visit. It's so relieving.
Seriously, if this exists I’m moving there today.
Yeah... That sounds like a ghetto :(
I say fuck that, I will call out anyone who disrespect me
My childhood friend came out as ftm, but refuses to transition because men should all die and testosterone evil
>One reason I like the trans communities on Reddit because they're generally positive and affirming about gender.

It seems a bit dramatic, a bit too *gushy* to say, but this is why I'm here.  It isn't that I'm here to help anyone - I'm rarely equipped for it - or to be helped directly - I'm at least as lousy at that.  Its that people come here and scream into the void only to find *someone* on the other end willing to offer some small bit of human decency.  That inspires me to help on those rare occasions that I think I can, but more importantly, it has helped me be okay with, well, *me*.
> If someone is MTF, they can be affirmed. If someone is FTM, they can be affirmed. If someone is non-binary, that's cool too.

Switching up the positive descriptor when it comes to NB people is trans culture /lh
No I don’t live in Philly.
Let's all move there and just take over the entire neighborhood lmao. A community made entirely of trans people, that'd be nice
Wow that's sad
super sad... trans men are not the ones who should be held accountable for the domestic abuse rates and r@pes made by CIS men (mostly. ofc trans men can do them but lets be honest it's a minority of crimes committed by men overall)
Shoot. Well, if you ever have a chance to take a trip. It's nice and refreshing to see pride flags on every lightpole and queer people on every sidewalk!
Yeeesssss😩
yeah...
please dont try to brush off the issue with this discourse by pushing the blame onto cis men. that doesnt help anyone and is still a bigoted line of thinking
That would be nice.  Where I live is fine.  My neighborhood is quite liberal but I’ve only seen one pride flag out beside my trans flag.
That emoji is not on the reddit list of approved emojis.I wish I was that brave
I suppose it'll be hard to convincz them. I would say that not all men are bad and they can be proof of that
Anddddd yes lol I’m going to make it my mission in life to start making that 🫡
Yeah but he was the kind of guy that would tell me a lot of gaslighting stuff, so not really a good guy.... I stopped talking to him like a year ago because he was saying that America is the worst country in the world to my immigrant family
That really sucks
I mostly just feel sorry for him lol"	ulvfef	trans	2402	0.96	2022-05-09 16:41:48
Sad that so many gamers are very anti-LGBTQ	"So I was playing Rainbow Six Siege and I saw that they released a cosmetic bundle as a promotion from the R6 guardian event (a charity event) and it was for LGBTQ so obviously I had to buy it, the bundle came with an outfit for the trans character that’s in the game and also a rainbow background for all character cards. So after buying it and using the cosmetics I played some matches and at first all was well but the I encountered a very bigoted person who teamkilled me then 
started drawing swastikas on the walls, it was honestly just sad to see someone like that especially in a game that has 3 openly LGBTQ characters and has a development studio that’s very pro-LGBTQ. Of course I did the only thing I can do and reported him for what he did also out of spite I made my profile very openly pro-LGBTQ, we cannot be silenced because we will only get louder"	"And on the other hand we have destiny and valorant where half the users use gay banners
I played a lot of For Honor and nazis managed to make swastikas with the banner editor. But every time I see that I focus solely on team killing them the entire match. One time the rest of my team left, and the enemy team actually helped me do it. We cornered him and they all taunted while I attacked him, then after he was dead we danced around before I let them win. Gamers are overall pretty horrific but there's some good ones out there. The nazi sent me some awful messages afterwards and I just laughed at him.
It's because they are mostly 12 year old boys who still think calling someone gay is the pinnacle of comedy insults.

The amount of trash that you get paired up with when playing with other humans is why I do single player games only.
TIL there are LGBTQ characters in R6S...and now I kind of want to play again...

Are there any LGBTQ R6S clans/guilds?
Any space filled with white youth that isn’t explicitly left wing gets overrun by nazis/libertarians/other demons.
I played my first match on r6s and someone ran in front of my shot and it killed them, they started spamming me to kill myself, fun times.

I'd like to actually try playing it with a group though, playing with randoms isn't fun, way too many people get so angry and suck all the fun out the game.
There has been an online reactionary backlash against inclusion of minorities in games (gamergate) for years now. And at the moment it seems to be particularly focused on hating trans people. So yeah, it is very sad. And dangerous at times. I won't really participate in any gaming space that isn't left wing, anarchist, or queer because of it.
This is why i am as gay trans and communist as possible to cancel it out
I've found it really depends on genre. Online FPS games are one of the worst, most toxic spaces I've seen. Mmo/RPGs can be a mixed bag.(destiny and fallout 76 have been good experience for me, but there's some fps bleed over).  From my limited experience, the fighting game community is really cool and accepting.

Something I noticed a long time ago is fans tend to project onto games, and relate to them. Ie: sonic fans are hyper and goofy, fnaf fans and KH fans love making convoluted stories, etc. So what type of people tend to be attracted to games that are often about glorifying the American military, especially something like rainbow six which tends to basically be a police state fantasy.
Unfortunately these kind of spaces can be pretty awful, majority young white boys + anonymity + right wing influencers in youtube communities

Hopefully that person gets banned
Unfortunately online players tend to be Edgy... And there's no way to know if they're ironic or not, even asking them won't give you the answer
I have had the exact same issue playing another Ubisoft game, For Honor. it's by far the most toxic game I've ever played so I shouldn't be surprised, but it's still saddening to get hateful messages about my trans flag emblem every time I play the game :c
It’s specifically men who are insecure about their lack of masculinity too. They’re afraid they aren’t enough of a man so they bully the only people less masculine than them that they can find.
Anonymity emboldens people. Remember that. That’s why the KKK wear hoods over their heads. They would never do what they do with their identities revealed.
I don't play warzone anymore because of the players that go out of their way to ruin my game because of my trans flag calling card... Im not going to give my time to a game that doesn't care to have some sort of discrimination protection
Faudrait les tuer ces fdp de néo-nazis
Honestly the community is toxic as shit recently. It's such a shame because I've been playing since year one and the community has only gotten worse over time. Literally came back recently and quit again because I can't stand by a community that unironically thinks being a racist, sexist homophobic POS is okay. I was a service member, I played siege for a team oriented kill house simulator and it turned into a scifi clusterfuck filled with edgy children. Tom Clancy would be rolling in his grave.
Rainbow Six Siege player here too. Same thing happened as soon as I used the card background. Hit me up if you want to play sometime on PC.
I’m not surprised, gamers also known for being hella sexist so transphobia sounds about right.
Omg so true these kids....
I hope you turned on reverse friendly fire so he couldn’t TK you anymore

Sorry that happened to you sadly R6 is probably one of the most toxic games that’s popular so you’ll encounter that 😞
He's deffinetly 10 years old and didnt go through puberty or is in a homophobic family
But honestly, imagine being this sad. Imagine having never met someone, seeing they have a rainbow cosmetic and then draw swastikas in hopes that you’ll offend somebody. People are just weird, they tell us we’re snowflakes and purposefully provoke us. It’s like poking a bear with a stick and getting angry when the bear attacks you
I play league of legends, so…
Rainbow 6 is one of the worst communities in the world, period.
As soon as I saw the title I was like...hmmm, Siege? 
Sorry you're going through that. If you ever need someone to play in a safe space, let me know! Usually my friends play bigot bingo and it helps sting a bit...even if kids are throwing slurs at grown ass adults.
Was playing Team Fortress 2 some time back as Heavy and was doing a massive push against the enemy team. Then one of my own team mates started calling me every slur in the book over voice chat and text, then called a vote kick. Just cause I had trans colors on my PFP at the time. Got booted, but solace being the Medic that was healing me reached out and said our team lost cause of that. So, silver lining from an overall shit situation
thats literally just how the rainbow 6 community is from my experience. If youre not a “normal” cis-het male, you’re gonna get targeted and harassed in that game. id get bullied simply for having a furry profile pic, team killed and sent hate messages literally for a hobby. stopped playing the game since it got old for me, but ive never had a worse experience in any other game, including Call of Duty, which is known for its toxicity, so that says something about rainbow 6
Yeah its very prevalent on PC siege I’ve heard from the subreddit of folks being killed for the gay background 😔

Thankfully I’m usually always in a stack of 2-5 so I never have to deal too much with toxcivty
Damn that sucks, reporting him was the right move
Dragon age inquisition opened up more lgbt characters like iron bull
Yeah that's so disgusting. I hate how irritating and hateful gamers can be. I notice that kind of shit too when I'm playing GTA and I'm just tryna do missions but my team mates are too busy bullying my openly gay character by like running me over numerous times with their cars, on foot and in my vehicle, blowing my shit up, etc. It's to the point where I get really nervous when playing him and there's times where I can't bring myself to play that character just because I don't want to deal with the chance of a gross bigot bullying the shit out of him when I just want to make some money. It's really sad.
Isn’t that because most of them are 12 year old edgelords?
This is why my trans friend is afraid to even be perceived online...
R6’s player base is wildly toxic
You’re playing the wrong games
Siege is one of those games that gets played by a lot of young teenagers who try their hardest to be edgy and stuff, much like call of duty. And so I wouldn’t worry, it’s probably some little shit going through an edgy alt right phase, and When they grow up will discover that they are trans themselves😂

And if it was a grown human being, they must have quite a sad life to be doing stuff like that.. just be glad you’re a happier person than them
Learn to cube. 
(Rubik’s cube and other twisty puzzles)

There are fewer places I have found more LGBTQIA+ and ND friendly than the r/cubers discord server. 

Cisgender 40+ queer person myself, and it just disgusts me how transphobic so many spaces are. Especially within queer spaces. The hypocrisy enrages me. 

Also, cubing is legit amazing.
Report that person and any person who treats you that way
It's all in the comunitys the fighting game and mom community are filled to the brim with LGBT people fighting Games aspecialy are so full of us
Yeah... a few people have made... weird... comments about my rainbow flag antenna in Rocket League. Never expected to be asked what's in my pants when playing car football lol. It's not a very common occurence for me at all, but I've gotten at least mildly homophobic comments a couple of times over the years, just because of a rainbow flag item that's been in the game for about ever.

So anyway, I did the only reasonable thing I could: I put a trans flag into my steam profile picture, as I did on every other platform. It's only a small little thing, but it makes me feel more confident about myself, and it's a bit of a middle finger to any transphobes I have the displeasure of playing with/against. Like deal with it, I'm here.
I believe that this is not true that so many gamers are anti-lgbtq+. Just based on your experience in that match you came across someone that was a negative player a troll shall I say . The gaming community is filled with them.  Because its virtual there is no shame. You say things out of anger just because you can. Their only intentions is to piss you off end of story .People get called out daily on twitch for saying the N word but those that don’t stream will go unchecked besides getting reported. But by the end of it if they get banned big deal they will make a new account  or move on to the next game . All gamers have a heart of gold . We suck when try , we are amazing when we don’t try , and we argue to defend ourselves   But at the end of the day we ain’t that angered to do true violence because its  the reason why we play in the first place to escape reality  for whatever reason we do  it’s in good fun for all of us . For all trolls just do what is needed report and move on  don’t let them get in your head . Have fun  cause you don’t who you’ll be facing next .
Youre in the wrong crowd if youre coming across so many. Ive been gaming for over 2 years and maybe hit like 3 anti lgbt gamers because Im careful with where i choose to be. That being said its said that we have to be careful at all.
I don't mean to be rude but I think this is mostly selection bias. I do encounter trans hostile people aswell, but they're definitly in the minority, both IRL and in games. Humans lean towards paying more attention to negative things. Like, did you ever count how many people you had in your game that were not like this?

On a sidenode: unless you know that person was a guy, you shouldn't assume it. I find it very annoying that everyone in video games, per default, assumes I am male just because. I think that's a bad behaviour and we should act as a good example and not assume peoples gender.
Its rainbow
I wish we would stop perpetuating stereotypes this way. Because lots of people share your viewpoint but the loudest and meanest are the ones that are heard and if you ALSO do the work of going around saying aloud that these are anti-whatever spaces that just reinforces and solidifies it!! You just did their work for them! Instead we need to hang onto each other and lift each other up and point out and celebrate when people are being inclusive. Just a thought. I know this was a rant meant to gather other angry people but I’m so tired of being so angry I wish we could focus on the positive instead of perpetuating this hell hole. It’s the people who want to see this ended who talk about it the most. Be aware that in the hopes of venting you are keeping other people afraid to enter spaces that they should enter. Does that make sense? Lets end it
1 example its not everyone. I heard this same thing the other way around too
Agreed... Check out /r/Gaymers though :)

Also does anyone play Rust??? 😭 I need a partner or group!
From what I’ve been told by a friend who used to play lots of R6, that community in specific is full of a lot more bigoted people than any other community that is known to be toxic (which is basically anything competitive multiplayer tbh). They would regularly receive hate mail and death threats which compared to something like say Valorant, yeah they’re assholes but after the game is over you likely won’t ever see or hear from them again
In runescape people RIOTED over an optional pride event that gave you a flower crown and changed a very small amount of flowers from grey to the rainbow colours.

I know that runescape players riot over everything, but i didnt expect that many of my fellow runescapers to be so bigoted to riot over an optional event that doesnt happen every year.
Well I’m happy to tell u that this gamer is bi and trans 🏳️‍⚧️
I have played CSGO and my PFP was my fursona with a pride flag on them and I never encountered someone attacking me or saying shit to me. Which is kinda surprising to be quite honest. But they are like pretty racist
I tf was up with that guy
Rainbow six is a shit show sometime but I met the best ppl there too. ""Edgy"" ppl that will pick onto anything in hope to make you mad.
I wouldn’t keep your profile openly pro rainbow club out of spite. For Pride and visibility, 100%. 

That’s why I do it online. I want people to see the trans colors and think “Oh hey, one of those. Cool.”  Maybe another trans person sees the pfp on RA and think, “I’m not alone”, for half a second. 

And yeah, all the cishet boys then have a target, but whatever.
I think with games like Rainbow Six or perhaps COD you'll encounter a bunch of teenage boys who try to be edgy or are radicalized from toxic media platforms like Andrew Tate. I remember when first playing MW2 back in the old days it was pretty toxic then too, perhaps now moreso. I'm glad you did the right thing. We can't be silenced.
It’s demoralizing sometimes but we can never be kept down for long!
I loved that game for the ten days I played it, I had enough a few days ago I’m kinda heart broken cause I loved it so much and was starting to get better and better but the community is so shit I quit it all at once and idk if I can go back to it. I really wanna cause they’re about to release a new operator 

Like I’ve never liked online shooters but I love this one and I just couldn’t take the bullshit anymore. Ten days of playing I could write a book on all the shit was said in chat, messaged to me, voice messages, party invites, team kills, hacking and everything 

When I get into a game like I did this one a few days ago it takes my mind off my anxiety and depression and this game actually made me consider suicide again, just pushed me right on the edge so I quit playing it
Wait R6 siege has a trans operator?
This really depends on what games you’re playing. If you’re focusing on the big triple A multiplayer games, especially the FPS ones, you’ll find a ton of transphobia and homophobia. If you’re spending your time in Minecraft or other exploration and sandbox games, it’s hit or miss. In the RTS and Grand strategy spheres you’re more likely to find transphobia and homophobia as you play more competitively.

The best games, in my experience, tend to be the ones with the most active modding communities. There’s something about games that are kept alive by the content contributions of their devoted fans that just provides a safe haven for lgbtqia+ people and Allies.
sounds like you need to report him? you encountered one person, who was mind you anonymous and in a digital environment, meaning people are letting their bad sides out much more. i wouldnt bother myself about it, report them if you want, tell them you F'd their mom last night, and possibly block them.

&#x200B;

its one person. i had much different experience, tho im not playing all that much
Same issue here, it sucks I wish I had more friends to play with so I wouldn't have to always watch my back and not be afraid to have that on my chars background
That’s exactly why I feel more safe playing story games/limited multiplayer games because you run into a lot less young/teenaged edgelords trying to be cool I’m sorry that happened you definitely did the right thing and especially with not standing down with your profile
Yes , that’s indeed sad , and many games I’ve played are most likely played by 12 yr old kids that don’t even really know what LGBTQ+ is … they are still homophobic.
Are you kidding, ITS HILARIOUS, obviously in R6 maybe not cause team kill, but cod or bf all they can do is throw insults and its so funny to watch em get SO MAD because i exist!
This may not be the best news, but sadly its not just the players.

I work for a large company, bordering on AAA, large team, and they're all lovely, and I think they're all fond of me and would go to bat for me, so that's the positive.

But we had a talk about writing LGBTQ characters into video games, one of the panelists was ex bioware staff. He worked on Mass Effect 1, and when that was being developed, a lot of the developers pushed back, with the same arguments we attribute to capital G Gamers. Developers would come to the staff and say ""What the hell? I don't want gays in my video game, I'm making this and I don't want the gays to be forced in."" Not a direct quote, at this point its like, 3rd hand? But it gets the point across.

This was of course 15+ years ago at this point (AAAHHHHhhh), and it seems that more modern folks are far more accepting and supportive, but I've still had some very weird interactions surrounding LGBT issues in games, not just from Gamers, but from devs too.

Again, I do wanna say, the trend seems to be positive, slow, sure, but positive, and nobody on my team has ever been anything but supportive and nice, partially because there would be serious reaper cushions if they weren't nice to me, and partially cause I think they are genuinely nice people.

Edit: You can be sure as hell that I'm fighting to put that sweet, sweet NB rep in our game.
Sadly incels are proliferate gamers, and they have a significant overlap with Christo-fascists and neo natC’s (that vein diagram is almost a circle). You get all sorts good and bad. Wish you could get people banned for drawing hate symbols though. Screenshot that shit, that way people who aren’t enraged by something that’s none of their business will be able to enjoy the game for once.
Yeah I just mute them and don’t engage , if they have no way to alter my game other than words , then muting them usually sends them packing
ah a fellow seige player 
im sorry
i always hated how toxic fps games are, like i like them but so many people that play them just insult each other all the time
Gamers can’t even accept that women (or people who sound like women-) play video games… so I’d genuinely be *shocked* if they weren’t anti-LGBTQ… which isn’t to say it doesn’t fucking suck, I’m just saying, it’s disappointing but not surprising
Siege has a trans character?
I play dcuo and the ppl in that community are very anti gay mind u thou they have a lot of gay stuff in the game the auras trinkets that has a rainbow hearts and unicorns a rainbow cape. So when ever I encounter ppl like that I just block them I don’t report them cause just like me they wanna play as well so I let them have there fun I don’t get stress over negativity from ppl I don’t know I just block them on the game and I won’t see what they are saying in open chat
I’ve also play destiny but it’s so hard to meet transgender on the game there should be some type of way we can all communicate I’m a guy im attracted to trans women and one day I hope to meet one that’s a gamer just like me
I mean, yeah, you play cop simulator you're bound to get a couple ""people"" like that
I know a lot people still trash it but fallout 76 gave us little pride flag icons and a lot of people actually do have them on when they’re playing.
R6 HAS A TRANS CHARACTER?
R6 HAS A TRANS CHARACTER?
oh yeah gamergate is coming back in a big way - especially with the manosphere and conservative ideology in general becoming more prominent over the years.
I didnt read it all. First line says R6 and that game is toxic in the best of times. If its anything like warzone its tough to avoid the trash talk. My old crew would all rock trans/rainbow/ or lesbian banners on our gamer tags and be hunted relentlessly. I just cant play those games anymore. And I loved those kinds of games
This is precisely why I avoid online gaming with the exception of playing anything with my kids. But there are excellent single player games too. Personally I like CP2077 on PC.
Man, people are awful. I am not a part of the gaming community, but it really depresses me that what used to be (allegedly) a safe space for people who were different is so full of hatred, and good for you for being loud and proud and reporting this type of behaviour. I hope that these people can grow out of their hatred and see the errors on their views and the harm it actively causes to people who for the most part are in a vulnerable position.
On a side note, I also feel bad for the people whose symbol was stolen (Buddhist temples around the world use the crooked cross from where the swastika was inspired. For example, in Japan it's a character called ""manji"", which, according to my research, is supposed to represent luck and/or blessings), and on top of that for that symbol to be representative of such hatred as the bigots who use it, not only because it represents racism, but also because it represents homophobia, transphobia, ableism, colorism and antisemitism.
Ha yeeeah that’s why I only play single player on most games

People are terrible across the board
I totally agree and sympathise with you here, of course, but regarding ""development studio that's very pro-LGBTQ""... I don't know about that. Pro-LGBTQ content is in their games, yeah, but the record Ubisoft has with treatment of minority groups and also women internally is not exactly great.

I know it's a tangent from what the post is about and just picking a small detail apart, but I think it's worth noting Ubisoft's history.
As a trans competitive R6 player, I feel your pain.  It is sad however that's just the way it is.  FPS games tend to draw in that conservative crowd.  Siege in particular has the most politically conservative playerbase of any esports shooter I believe.
R6?

See that's where you went wrong. 

Also, name a more iconic duo than gamers and bigotry.
I don't play the game l, but can you tell me witch character is the trans one?
I play games on playstation and barely run into any issues I'm openly transgender on there to no one I've ran into for years on it hates me for being lgbtq however Xbox was the worst horrible people on that platform
I've also experienced a lot of transphobia and generally hate in several games, I understand how you feel.
Cas you truly call yourself a gamer if you're net insufferably toxic????
i dont rly play alot of games anymore and when i do theyre singleplayer games. the only time i really play with other people is minecraft and i found a server where majority of the people are either lgbtq+ themselves or allies.
There's a subreddit called r/transgamers, where you can find lots of transgender people who are gamers!

Also, there are genuinely LGBTQIA+ supportive games with queer characters. Try playing Ikenfell! Ikenfell is a hidden gem and is totally worth the money! Just like Undertale, it's a queer-friendly game with low-quality graphics but high-quality story, characters, etc.!
And that is when you report these people, honestly people need to start reporting bigots and not letting them hide
It’s really sad and infuriating. There are also a lot of gamers who are racist. 
My boyfriend constantly gets called racial slurs online when he’s playing. 
I like games but not at a point where I consider myself a gamer. But hearing people online say racial slurs and say and do things that are extremely transphobic and homophobic makes me not want to play online.
It’s really just the r6 fanbase. Playing that for too long turns some people into very toxic people.
My gaming library is exclusively Celeste and Fallout New Vegas and Guilty Gear, idk about you friends
It seems that whatever games we play, the biggots are always there… Some companies take this kind of harassment very seriously though, so maybe use the ingame report function, if nothing else, team killing is griefing basically everyone in your team and usually competitive games do not like that, so that might at least get his account marked or warned or something.

Side note, its also Ubisoft, very famous for being openly misogynistic and having a horrible work culture about harassing women and other minirities..
Self identified capital ""G"" Gamers™ are horrible, but they're not the only people who play video games, I'd go so far as to say they're a loud and obnoxious minority.
For anyone arriving in this thread late, but looking for some positivity, [here's](https://twitter.com/Casperdile/status/1541206778326687744?t=EIvM9a677T86sN-pFKTkmg&s=19) a packed fighting game event cheering for trans and abortion rights. Even the commentators get hyped.
Hot damn good for you stay proud and stay strong 💪🏻 🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Testament and Bridget from Guulty Gear Strive :3
Yeah I put the pride card background on most of my ops just to spite the reactionaries. Also, if you’d be interested in queuing siege together, dm me because I  play that game way too much and I need trans friends on it
*OSRS pride event flashbacks*
I have played R6 alot over the years and you will always find players like that wich will team kill you for no/dumb reasons. Hopefully the new reputation system will make it better in future. There will be friendly fire from the beginning as a sanction for players who kill a lot of teammates 🤷🏼‍♀️
The same has happened to me! It sucks how bigoted people can be.
Yeah ever since I started figuring myself out I decided to cut off social features in the game. It's the only way I can still enjoy this phenomenal FPS in peace sadly. 
I know there's good people too, but the bad are too bad to ignore.
Try Ranboo. He's open to anything but hate
I’ve never really played online games besides something like garden ware fare but usually people don’t insult me since I more often than not carry my team
That's why I play dead by daylight so much. Trans and pride flag and almost everyone wears it
Overwatch is saddly really bad too. Havnt seen any myself but i read a ton of stories on it.
report, ignore, move on. It's all there is to do really.

The truth of the matter is that a lot of the people you encounter being transphobic, homophobic or whatever else don't actually have anything against anyone from the communities they're apparently so vehemently against. They're doing it for one reason, and one reason only: attention.

They don't care if you're LGBTQ+ or not, they care about getting someone to notice them. If you watch closely these people are typically the most generic folk you'll ever encounter. They're not very good at the game, hell, they're not even very bad at it, they're just... average. And when you're an average nobody (typically men, as women recieve a lot more attention in general, but especially in these spaces), it's easy to fall into the desperation of trying to get someone, *anyone*, to notice you.

They're lashing out to find any reason they can to be noticed, and they'll attack you for anything ""different"". Anything that makes you stand out, because it's easy. They're drowning in addrenaline and testosterone from the compettetive games they're playing and having their own averageness constantly blasted in their face and it's just a perfect boiling pot to bring out the most vitriolic, vile side of a person.

They don't hate you, they hate themselves.

How do I know this? Because I once was one of these people, and it took a lot of effort and personal growth to stop being one.

So report them, ignore them, and move on. Whatever you do, don't engage. If you give them attention, you'll feed the trolls, and they'll keep doing it.

This is the exact same reason you get blatant hackers and greifers (the ones who aren't hiding it). They're desperately lonely and just want someone to care about them *because they have nobody.*

I'll also add as an addendum that this is by no means an excuse, but I think people should remember the reason behind this shit because it's just a symptom of a bigger issue and not what we hear a lot that they're just hate filled. Well they are, but it's not directed at you, it's self hate.
Only LGBTQ+ related interaction I've had has been someone coming along in their rainbow livery Nissan Silvia while I was tearing around Forza Horizon 4 in my plain yellow Mazda, I changed into my pride Hellcat and we cruised for a bit :)
I don’t know if you’re into simulation games, but The Sims tends to have a large queer-friendly user base and EA just updated the character creator so you can make transgender Sims. It upset some people, but EA told them to shut the hell up because Sims had technically always been trans anyway. In TS4 anyway. 

In previous games you had to use mods.
Agreed I'm opening pro-LGBTQ anywhere I can be to show my support and that my chats guilds etc are safe places
I don’t think i’ve played a single valorant match since June where no one had a pride banner.
Destiny also has trans characters! Namely Oryx and Ignovun (though there's a Re:Zero-type dispute over whether Ignovun ""just crossdresses"" or is de-facto trans)! :3

I also like how the Destiny-verse touches on transhumanism, what with the themes of rebirth, transferring human conscience into android bodies and all that!

In conclusion, Destiny is based af!
Fun fact: Took until last Season (Haunted) for us to see the first non-LGBTQ+ couple in-game in the form of Zavala and Saviyah. Otherwise for the many years the game has been out we’ve only seen full-fledged relationships being LGBTQ+
and tf2 where half the playerbase is queer and the other half are alt right nazis.
Yeah apex is cool for that too
Also the fighting game community, it's surprisingly queer
I've been playing Dead By Daylight for a while recently, and I've been impressed by how queer the community is- there's like a dozen streamers who do drag with sizeable audiences, tons of lgbt streamers- the little wearable rainbow (and progress) flags are super super common. (The in-game rep COULD use some work, still, especially since so much well known horror has. Less tasteful elements. But the devs are working at it and the community can be really great)

Oh, they also gave out a cute rainbow crow charm this year, too, during pride month. You can literally fill your charm equips with all pride gear, it rules.
Trans valorant card >>>>
Hey just cuz I play Valorant doesn't mean I'm..
valo and league heavily depend on realms and elo
2018 modern warfare usually has at least one pride flag per round  which is suprising considering thats like 1/10 people
Aside destiny do you know any openly LGBT shooter? I'm looking for some and idk
There are a few bad apples on lfg saying things like ""KWTD no trans embem or kick""
Yeah I use the trans and pride flags on my Hunter and Titan and have gotten several hateful messages from other players. I bet they'd have a tantrum if they realised one of the biggest villains in Destiny is trans 😅
I have this same issue with For Honor, there are so many people with awful emblems like that. I get a lot of hate mail because my emblem is the trans flag too, but sometimes I actually get nice messages. at least I know I'm not the only trans person playing this dumb game lol
This.  It’s just 10-16 year-old edgelords for the most part, often people that grow out of it.  I often remind myself the person on the other end of a Reddit thread, game, whatever is likely a child and not worth arguing with.
It was like that 20 years ago too. It's that ignorant teenage boy stuff.
Probably even younger. Most of the toxic players I’ve encountered while gaming were just 9 year olds trying to seem older and cooler but just ended up being annoying.
Unfortunately I've run into my fair share of bigots playing games and way more often than not they're fully grown men.
V good point, i was just gonna ask how you get the wee flag next to your username?
Exactly why I hate most multiplayer games. The human trash you often get paired with or the immature little kids make many multiplayer games frustrating to play at least, and unplayable at most.
Yea the only pvp I do is Pokémon where no one knows who you are or hears your voice or knows anything about you. Other than that I’m perfectly content spending another 500 hours collecting korok seeds in breath of the wild
single player games for life, I don't understand the appeal of playing in lobbies with morons and people who scream and shout everything.
Yeah, Same here. Too old, too tired to Deal with those Babies.
Either that or a party of friends
Those 12 year old boys are stuck in 2014
Don't give up entirely, there are games out there with more mature audiences that don't really have this issue. I've been playing Planetside 2 for the last few years and it's absolutely shocking how different it's community is compared to other shooters. 

Being a game based very heavily around teamwork, with less of a compettative edge it doesn't bring out this crap in people, and for whatever reason PS2 has managed to garner an older audience (the oldest guy I play with is in his 70's (he's also a monster with a shotgun)). I guess it helps that there's a running joke that theme tune for the faction i play on is ""It's okay to be gay"", but the other factions don't have issues with anything like this. There was a community leader for a player group called the ""Deathwatch Marines"" who styled themselves on anime and warhammer 40k and were the steryotypical gamer guys, who came out as Trans a while back and the entire european server's comunity just didn't give a damn. They just started calling her, ""Her"" and calling her Eilidh and that was that.

I see this as something akin to teh issue VRChat players have avoiding children: it's about finding ways to filter them out. Playing a game that doesn't appeal to kids, and requires making more adult decisions to succeed is one way to do that.
Yeah the characters are Flores, Osa and Sens they are gay, trans and non-binary respectively, there are lots of communities out there that you could join up with
same tbh,,,,,
And they always infest all the fun cool stuff too
Love how you casually added ""other demons"" 😂 certainly fitting!
Genuinely confused about why libertarians made the list? To me it would seem to be a pretty broad spectrum of anti-authoritarian ideologies, no? I don't see how that's a bad thing.

Or is this referring to a particular kind of libertarianism? The US Democratic Party (doubt that it's truly libertarian but it's been called that before I think)? I might have a wrong or different understanding of what libertarianism means.
[removed]
I’m a libertarian. We’re not all demons. We just want to be able to live our lives the way we want. Isn’t that what you want? And isn’t that why you’re in this sub?
Yeah sometimes people just take themselves and everything way too seriously even though it shouldn’t be. 

Playing with friends is a very fun time tho
Totally share your feelings on this! Tried playing CoD again for the first time in ages and immediately noped out of multiplayer.
This.
I feel very called out by the FNAF and KH part, but you're absolutely right.
Any game that makes you the ""hero"", or lets you be one will attract people who crave attention. People who crave attention are the ones who act like shit because they're doing it *solely* to get attention.

This is why Planetside is an FPS that doesn't get that like, at all; because you can't be the hero. Co-incidentally, it's also why the pro gamers can't stand it. Because in a game where you can't ""1v12 clutch"" and have to rely on your squad or your platoon you can't stand out. They claim they don't like being unable to make a difference, but you can, you do it through leading entire platoons of otehr players, not through being ""that one unkillable dude"". 

Any game that makes you just another cog in the machine will invariably avoid the attention starved kids. Any game that pitches you 1 on 1 against an opponent will likely avoid them because they don't have an audience to give them attention, just one other person.

Any game that will tout you as the champion, and puts you in with a group will always have these issues. it's not a gamer issue, it's a human issue.
Yeah it’s a recipe for disaster.


It was a Smurf account so it doesn’t matter if they get banned.
There’s a difference between edgy and just being an asshole, most teens don’t understand that sadly
Arin Hansen once said doing something ironically still means you get to do it. He meant that to justify enjoying silly things like saying the word dope, but I think it applies for 'ironic' edgelord bigots too.
If you believe the behavior OP describes is ""edgy,""  stay well away from the edge. This is just bigotry. There is no room for 'irony' here. Literally none. No one needs to tolerate hatred, 'ironic' or otherwise.
Nah, it's not about masculinity, it's men and boys who are completely attention starved. I've encountered women like this but they're *far* rarer, because women get more attention in general.

They're mostly not even transphobic, they're just saying that to get your attention, because it gets them a reaction.

Negative attention is still atention. That's why you can't focus them, you can't engage, you can only report them, ignore them, and move on.
Oui sérieusement
Oui
It doesn’t matter because reverse friendly fire doesn’t work on explosive so that match was basically just ruined for me but at least they get a 30 minute ban for TKing
I've never had hate for having the transflag homeguard
That fucking sucks. I have a lot of great experiences in TF2, but every once in a while I get a really toxic lobby. I try to find good community servers to favorite and return to. I hear uncletopia and banana servers are pretty positive and well-moderated for the classic modes.
Side note, it also doesn't help how Rockstar themselves don't seem to be very LGBT+ friendly.
Had a cubing club in high school. Every one was either nd or queer, I'm both
Good point i agree
I'm pretty sure they confirmed it was almost entirely new accounts doing that, and a bunch of them got banned including the old players
yea, osa is the op
Osa is trans what
I know multiple people who hated it at Ubisoft and are LGBTQ+, they are just a corporate machine and we are a marketing tool to them.
The sad thing to is that there’s probably a lot of really good and nice gamers out there but the shitty ones are just so loud it’s hard to find the good ones
I have skullgirls on there because guilty gear doesn't exist for linux, but i am really bad at it. Do you have any tips on how to get started in fighting games (besides playing the tutorial)?
ive been using the trans one for like a year now.
wow i’ve been the only one using the trans one for like 90% of my games in the past two months
yeah lmao but one of my friends had the mlm banner despite being a straight woman for a bit which kinda sucked to see ngl
>Destiny also has trans characters! Namely Oryx and Ignovun

No one ever remembers Micah-10
D2 just slaps, honestly my fav game of all time, and im yet to get into late/endgame activities.
I think it'd be more accurate to say all Hive are genderfluid or genderless since they change their physical shape to fit their roles in their society and it's unlikely they perceive gender the same way we do.

Still really cool tho. Destiny's lore is fascinating.
Seriously Mara Sov and Eido (bi) ,  Saint and Osiris (gay) ,  Erianna and Wei Ning (lesbian)  Eramis (lesbian),  Devram (gay),  Micah 10 (trans), Ana Bray (lesbian) and there's still rumor that Crow when he was uldren was bi,  hawtorne was bi,  and I'd put my glimmer on the drifter being bi.  Like I think there's more lgbt than straight in this game and I love it
And I wouldn’t change it for the world
I haven't played in a while but in my time I've only seen swastikas, though maybe I'm just not recognizing other hate symbols. I know there's an emblem report tool but I would've hoped they'd done something to further curb the abuse. My emblem is the trans flag as well but I've got a symbol on it too so maybe that somehow hid the trans pride from bigots.

You're definitely not the only one though, in my time I spotted a handful of trans and LGBT flags. Unfortunately the nature of the game is also a prime target for supremacists who think they're celebrating their 'white heritage'. It's awful, but also makes it 5 times as satisfying when you wreck them and just know they're screaming in unintelligent rage.
This is exactly what I was going to say
The swastika kinda gives it away too. Just random edgelord shit. Kids are sponges and soak this shit up, and negative attention like that just makes them think it's hilarious. Oh wow so many people give me attention if I draw a swastika, look at me, I'm gonna say slurs too

The parents tell them that's stuff super bad, like the worst of ""bad words"", so they realize it gets the most attention out of anything.
It's a user flair, have a quick google on how to add a user flair in a sub because I honeslty doupt I will do any good trying to explain it 😅
That's why I play MMOs. If people get annoying most games have an option to turn off chat, and even specific chat channels, so I can just chill with my guildies and friends.
I used to play League of Legends but the players act like screaming toddlers so I quit after a few months.
I enjoy co-op games, team games, or ""lone wolf"" games- all of which you never hear anyone else aside from your friends if you so choose. I've never been able to justify team games or co-op games without good friends, even when I was younger and that was ""the thing"" as those old school Halo 3 lobbies sucked unless you had at least 1 or 2 good friends with ya. There'd always be that one kid, who's 12, shouting obscenities that they didn't even understand 🙄
That was another issue, you need a full team!
Multi openly gay characters and lets not forget a openly trans caster for the pro league, and it’s like these people didn’t learn anything or bother to try to learn. 

 I remember spawning as Flores when he first came out. I didn’t make it 3 steps before I got tkd for using a gay character. They spent the rest of the round using slurs and screaming over comms. I’d been playing since the very first closed test. I haven’t touched it since. Between the games failings and the toxic and abusive community I just went somewhere else. Glad they have a replay feature now to easily punish these people.
Also Caveira and Twitch are confirmed to be lesbians as well, they had a thing together at the time of R6's crossover with Ghost Recon, a few years ago.

Not the person you were replying to but in an ideal world, sort of. I just also know what kind of world a party that seeks to strip away social protections and workers protections would create. Your party's platform is bad for anyone but the social elite. I am not so sure that makes you a bad person, just a naïve one who fails to learn from history.
There’s a lot of libertarians trying to stop me from living the way I want. I’m glad you don’t.
Your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins.

Libertarians continually advocate for the ""freedom"" to oppress others. That's not just ""living your life the way you want"", and it is certainly not equal to wanting to be able to simply exist without discrimination.
the libertarian party in the us are just diet conservatives, and tend to act as such. i tend to not trust someone who says they're libertarian, because more often then not they turn out to be utter idiots who don't even know what libertarian means. but all of those libertarians have been cis het white men
This turn in a political talk, this is just going to get pepole hate. From my experience when pepole belive others are just evil and not human being there is no place for talking, just place for hate
I don't get it, I really can't get my head around people who rage and get angry at games.

If I had some I would totally be doing that lol
You should try playing Call of Duty Mobile. There's some buttheads but considerably less compared to PC versions of Call of Duty. Can't let some nutsacks ruin my love for the game. Add me too!
I say it out of love < :3
Good. I’m glad they got a ban, even if it was for a little bit
I have, a lot. LAN region is wild
I forgot to claim the banners for two years in a row :’)
Thank you for your service o7
I use it too all the time, the problem is I only exclusively play with my girlfriend so you won't catch me on any matches without her.
I always remember Micha-10. Love obscure lore
It’s amazing lmao. And every relationships is deeply well fleshed out if they are major characters, and still given good characterization if not. Devrim’s relationship is barely talked about yet still used to good effect in the few entries it is mentioned
yeah this is it exactly, it's just people who have nothing and noone in their lives who really care about them or ever give them attention, absolutely desperate for it.
Thanks 👍
I tend to activate my trans pro-level gamer skills
It sucks because the game itself truly is one of the best competitive strategy shooters in existence.

If you can get a solid group to game with it is an amazing time. I always used to try to get at least 3 people on a team so we had a majority vote/influence on the game. Unfortunately my friends stopped playing so now I can't play it anymore because that game has one of the worst fan bases I've ever encountered.

Oh yeah libertarian only works if people are fundamentally good which will never happen. Social protections on a government level are still required to prevent our society from being owned by the rich. It already is owned by the rich, unfortunately. I have learned from history. I’m just longingly wishing people would suck less.
Those people have a clear fundamental misunderstanding of their own political ideology.
Sounds like a centrist lowkey rightwing talking point but aight.
I'm sorry
wait, you need to claim them? i can't do it now?
Micah-10 is the definitive trans Destiny character imo

Nah, its just personal experience, i allways see the same problem, pepole get political, if you disagree they say ""you are (political party)"" and for no logical reason bad person and have invalid arguments, wich lead to ""you (falacy or personal attack)"".

i don’t feel safe in lgbtq+ spaces that much	"now don’t get me wrong, 99% of the trans community is amazing, i haven’t felt more accepted by literally anybody else. however, some cis people in my school have been really bothering me and i wanted to vent about it a little bit bc i feel like you guys will actually understand me.

so i (18, FtM) am currently a senior in high school. this girl in my class (whom i will call “ashley”) has repeatedly deadnamed and misgendered me, and i think she has been doing this on purpose.

firstly, when i sat next to her (bc that’s the closest desk to my other friends) she told me “why does everyone call you ___(my preferred name)?”, to which i replied with “i’m trans, i just go by that name.” since she lacks what i can only assume common sense, she asks me, “can i call you __(my deadname) though?”

i have no idea what was going through her mind to reach a conclusion in which she managed to assume i’d be okay with that. like, think of it this way: let’s say there’s a cis person and they have a first name and a middle name. they tell you that they don’t want you to use their middle name bc they don’t like it, understandably so; you would stop calling them by that name, without asking a second question.

this is not a one time occurrence either, she constantly brings up my deadname as a joke.  i’ve been very strict about not liking my deadname and i have warned her multiple times. she doesn’t give a flying fuck the girl’s a solid bitch i’m sorry.

surprise fact though, she’s bisexual. this came up when me, a couple of friends (including her and her bf at the time) decided to meet up.

her bf asks, “so y’all are bi, yeah?” 

and my other friend replied with, “no, i think he [talking about me] is gay.”

ashley interrupts by saying, “no that makes __(my name) a straight girl.”

everyone else at the table kinda just stared at her, including her cis bf.

i then lied and said, “haha no i’m bi.” or smth like that.

bc of her, i keep on lying to people about my sexuality simply bc i’m terrified that other people are possibly thinking the same about me, she just makes me feel unsafe.

lastly, she keeps calling me “sis” and some other gendered shit like that, despite the fact that i told her that i was very uncomfortable about that. 

i no longer talk to her but i think that was my worst experience as a trans guy thus far. i don’t get sad, though at many points this year, i had to restrain myself to not beat her up. thank god i no longer go to school since they don’t take attendance anymore.

this is not limited to her either, many cis queer women ask me invading questions all the time. and they get offended when i don’t want to talk to them about my fucking pussy. like dude, just bc we’re both queer doesn’t mean you’re my best friend. (or just bc we share the same “organs”)

thanks for reading (sorry this has been a long one.)"	"If she uses the wrong name for you feel free to make up a name for her.
Sounds like a lot of TERF activity happening around you, I'm really sorry you're dealing with that.
Controversial opinion here, but I feel like a people especially immature teens feel that since they are LGBTQ+ that they can do no wrong and that the world to some degree revolves around them.
You're a bigger man then me OP. I would've been a complete asshole to them
This reminded me of one situation when cis girl in my class (idk if queer or not but probably not) called me ""Dominika or whatever you call yourself"" in front of a whole class and supportive teacher. Dominika is female version of my chosen name wich have nothing to do with my deadname so it was so much worse because it showed me that she did that on purpose. Life throw at us really weird situations and my only real advice is: correct her every time she does that. Usually unsupportive people become really mad when you correct them twenty or more times in one conversation and either cut out your 'friendship' (wich is good because it means your friendship is less valuable for them than your comfort) or correct themselves due to you just not reacting. Only problem is that you loose your progress every time you forget about it because they see it as their win. Win them with patience! If playing on their nerves doesn't work I suggest an arson.
sounds like she's a terf and shouldn't be allowed in lgbtq spaces until she learns to be polite to others. haters can't sit with us. I'd give her the freeze treatment and just ignore her. 

when I worked as a barista in a small town, passing as a guy but everyone knew everything about everyone so everyone knew I was trans. 

there was this cis girl who kept trying to say various women's names at me when we were on shift together. to see if I had any kind of reaction to them. she was trying to GUESS my deadname. one time I looked over at her when she said one, and she was like ""yeah! your name must be Emily , I totally called it!"" and I just ignored her from then on.  (I didn't stay at that job very long lol)

my deadname isn't Emily though. so I guess I won. 

anyway if this girl doesn't stop I hope her bf breaks up with her, because she's being really nasty and cruel. 

also I promise not all LGBTQ spaces are like this. most people are trans-friendly, there are still assholes like this around but they are going the way of the dinosaur. keep your chin up. 

I hope your friends do more to stand up for you.  maybe you should talk to them about how it hurts. good luck man.
Cis gays can be extremely transphobic, my understanding is they see our identity as a threat to their own. I just try to shrug it off, but I can understand why it would bother you.

The LGBT community really does need to come together more and help one another instead of in fighting all the time.
I think you should just call her Karen because she's making up a name for you, so give her a taste of her own medicine
""That makes (him) a straight girl""

""I don't know if she's deadnaming me on purpose.""

..... u serious?
_I don’t usually condone or wish for physical violence upon someone…_

#However…

exceptions can be made.
Here's the best comeback for any time someone's putting the disrespect on you to your face;

""Oh hi, (deadname).""

""Oh, let me guess, somebody stole your sweetroll?""

""That makes (him) a straight girl.""

""What was that? Must've been the wind.""

""No lollygaggin.""

""Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me.""

""I know your kind, always sneaking about.""

""By the gods, you're diseased. Get yourself to the White Phial and purchase a remedy, before you infect us all.""

""Uch. Been tending your hounds? You smell like wet dog.""

That sounds like .... a really horrific girl but also peak high school bullshit. I'm sorry you're going through that.
Yeah, the thing about the LGBTQ+ community is that (in my opinion) is very toxic.

I don't why or how but they always keep attacking the trans people. Like I heard close lgbt friends saying things like: ""Oh but trans women can't be lesbians because in that case they will be heterosexual""

Or:""Oh but being bisexual is being transphobic because you don't like trans people""

Also, just to clarify. I know most of the community is very chill but in my experience being trans and bi, they are very toxic in some points.

But anyway be safe bro, peace.
What a piece of absolute human dog shit, and I'm sorry to any dookies dogs have dropped that are better than her.
I know how you feel, my school is actually pretty progressive, people are open about their sexualities and people are almost totally chill about it, and theres even a few trans people at my school. But in spite of that, transphobia is pretty common. Only a few of my friends really understand my being trans, and despite being open about it (this was a few years ago, back when i thought i was a trans man and went by he/him pronouns, im agender now) id be referred to as a lesbian for dating my afab partner and be reffered to as she. Thats just my friends, outside of my friend group ive been reffered to as it behind my back, people asking about whats in my pants, and the typical transphobic nonsense. Ive never been aggressively misgendered when talking to someone, but almost everyone i knew - besides of a few people - would call me a lesbian and use she/her pronouns for me.

 Sadly, being transgender is a lot less accepted in general, even by people in the lgbtq+ community. And it really sucks, especially since people in the same community are hardly better than those outside of it. But for being a trans person, the community youll find to be the most accepting and safe is other noncis people, which even then can be unaccepting if youre outside of the gender binary. It fucking sucks, and all we can hope is that it gets better in the future and do our best to work towards a more accepting future.
Ugh, hate it when there’s a classmate like this, had a terf keep misgendering all three trans students one summer in college and would do it in and out of class.

Two of them got severe dysphoria after having to share a car with her on a class trip since she’s also the argumentative to the extreme type (she would argue with the professor almost every class to the point the professor had to not answer her questions.)

I finally had to ghost/ignore her since she wouldn’t leave me alone even though the professor spoke to her multiple times and she continued to misgender me  on campus after the class had concluded.

So my advice would be to not engage or converse with her since she’s likely not gonna stop otherwise. 

If she deadnames you, ignore her since she’s clearly not addressing you and is addressing someone else ;)
Your generous not to freak out and flip out on her.
I’m glad you don’t go to that school anymore
That fake friend can go fuck herself
Oh my god she sounds like a nightmare.  I hope you can avoid her from here on out because this is ridiculous, she definitely knows what she’s doing and is doing it specifically to hurt you.  Being bisexual or any other queer identity does not excuse you to be transphobic.  Also it’s sexual harassment for someone you didn’t invite to talk about your biology to be bringing it up in casual conversation.  I think you said you’re a gay trans guy?  Good for you man, that in no way makes you what she called you, in fact you’re next level gay.
Unfortunately there is a huge percentage of queer cis women who are super terfy.
Time for some new friends. Does your school have a GSA?
I keep seeming to get into arguments with lesbians a lot about terf things. Quite a few of them still disagree with people being nonbinary too. They're one of the most gatekeeping groups I've had the displeasure of associating with at some point. From what I've heard cis gay men also have similar issues. I just kind of stay wary of majority cis groups, in general.
Unfortunately there are several people in the community that are terrible thankfully the are more good folks than bad folks. I have so many stories of people I could share.
As you are 18 and a senior, graduation is only a few months away.  You can leave all the ""problems"" behind.  Just a short wait.
im so sorry . i feel this . i got to a christian school rn and god its just so shitty . theres literally a guy in my class that said he will deadname if i ever ""do anything"" . specifically by saying ' stfu [deadname] ' hes even called me the f slur . im real tired of dumbasses just lacking basic respect . not even my principal will have the brain capacity to correctly gender me all the time and he even deadnames me still . schools and the people at them can be so stupid when it comes to trans people . glad you dont really have to deal with her anymore . if she does something off school campus at least push her or something while telling her to stick her transphobia up her ass so she hopefully stops
Yeah cis queer people can be so rude sometimes . I know I had a cis gay dude here on reddit stalk my old account to call me homophobic and telling me to off myself for calling myself gay while being a trans guy. Feels like you have to have the patience of a Saint to be a trans person and not fucking back hand people sometimes.
Honestly. I agree I feel so welcome in the trans community but like other lgbtq communities are kinda shoving it in my face or even ours I’m not gonna sit here putting words into anyones mouth this is purely my experience and it’s frustrating like yeah be open but don’t make it your personality i feel like that should be with everyone like I don’t feel safe telling other communities how I feel because I’m scared they’ll tell others when I’m not open open about it
How in the fuck does you being a gay trans guy = straight cis girl??? That’s what I don’t get
same
So sorry you have had to deal with that.  Glad you get to take some distance.  

She’s certainly doing it on purpose for whatever misguided reason.  I can see a few options for reasonably dealing with her nonsense.

A) ignore her, cut her out, turn away, walk away every time she says anything transphobic.

B) over correct her - any time she does it say “oh, no, no, no, here, repeat after me - “he” …”he” …”he”.   You’ll get it, don’t worry”. as if the reason she’s misgendering you is because she’s a little slow.

C) flatly correct her every single time without even looking at her and without giving it any energy 

D) get all your supportive friends to pile on and correct her each time she does it.  Five people shouting “him” each time she misgenders you should shame her into stopping.


And with the invasive questions from cis queer women - you can quickly educate them while setting a boundary “you probably don’t know this, but it’s considered offensive to ask a trans person about their genitals unless they bring the topic up.  I don’t answer questions like that.  I know it can feel uncomfortable to not know, but let’s fight the patriarchal, hetero-centric bullshit together by getting comfortable with the uncertainty.  Are you with me?”  Or something like that.  Builds connection while confidently laying down the law.

Best of luck, and you may want to plan ahead for how you’ll handle Ashley’s nonsense at prom, because she’ll probably ramp it up when she sees you in a tux.
> a cis straight man, feel some shame

Please don't assume cis straight men are any less capable of understanding such issues.
She's clearly transphobic, I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Is there any way to distance yourself from her or talk about it with your friends? I know that's easier said than done but stuff like this can take a really big toll on you if you're around it for too long. ❤️
Everyone else said some great stuff so I won't go there, but this...

> thank god i no longer go to school since they don’t take attendance anymore.

Wait, what?

You don't go to school because you're done with school? Or you don't because you decided to stop because they no longer check if you're there? Soooo you no longer know what the tests are on, don't do homework, aren't there for tests... etc... And are going to fail...

Dude tell me it's not that you're just skipping class now
Ohh i have this problem too, well I'm mtf and bc there's this 1 guy on my bus who keeps constant misgendering and deadnaming me and he knows and I come off the bus really upset, (he's in Yr 11 I'm in Yr 9) but he went to my primary so that's where he knows my deadname from so yeah it's rubbish but we gotta stick together and the reason I'm telling ppl like this is bc the last time I posted on the mtf reddit I got targeted bc they said oh yeah 'he's just a GUY and you'llnever be a girl and u need to learn to love your gender(and they made this rly obvious)' as u can tell I get rly pissed and then I do this where I angrily type even tho it may not come across that I'm angry but I actually am angry yk my brain is very weird now I look at it... sorry but also thanks for reading my short story.
Maybe she just fancies you and it's a way to get your attention?

I'm sorry for that happened op. I think that it's really courageous to be out (I'm not)
I suggest arson UwU
Ugh. She likes u or is attracted to you.  Guarantee it. She can get violenced tho. What a bish.
[removed]
Sorry to hear that man. Hope you get better experiences in LGBTQ+ spaces in the future.


Take it easy bro✌
This is why I turned away from traditional neo-liberal LGBT circles and toward communist and leftist circles, what's more unifing that class unity? And to be a transphobic communist is to violate your own principles, this is why I support more that just anti-capitalist LGBT movements, but expressly communist and socialist movements
Hate to be hard but: you're a man. Act like it.

https://youtu.be/F6wla6eOMWs

2:00 is where it's at.
There was a girl exactly like that that went to my school, she would lie about being nonbinary (she came out as cis a little later on, right before she started being transphobic to people), then befriend transmascs just to misgender them. She even started harassing my friend about their genitals and their birth certificate as a “joke” until they cried. Cis queers/“allies” can be awful
This isn't really about gay people or straight people or cis people or  trans people. This is about fuckin bitches. You can't control that, man. She's just being a ratty kid and you're gonna encounter more of those as time goes on but you can minimize your time and space with them, for sure.

I hope you get a really good friend group that has your back so you don't have to pay attention to crap like this. You hang in there okay? It gets better.
Sending you my support, she really is a bitch.

I have discovered too non trans lgb places are not the safest too, including cis lgb women who think they are safe by default (wich happens to really really not be the case). It’s sad but yeah :(
Tbh I allow ppl to deadname and misgender me all the time it’s their liberty to be an ass, but from my point of view and personal experience it’s a real waste of time trying to care about what other people think of you. I learned this after hurting for so long, we can’t force people to like us. Let them assume and misjudge you, in reality they don’t know you. Don’t even feel bothered by it, thing that hurts them the most is seeing you not caring at all. Trust me, 2 years MtF in an Islamic country and still holding strong here, I’ve never been able to flaunt it tho everything I do is low key to avoid the court ofc. Had to DIY my HRT and everything, misgendering and deadnaming is the least of my worries.
Look dude the world is basically divided in 3 thrd , the first one is empathetic, they will understand even if start rough, the second third walks the world blindly unless a problem trigger their empathy cause touch them or someone they know, the las third don’t care about anyone, so potentially 2 third of the world that surrounds you can be your allies, if you have patience to make the second third to understand you. One third is lost on they’re believes and give them for lost.  Now being trans is one of the more complete and complex of human experiences, carry suffering on the way. You have to strong yourself and learn to give a fuck, there is a strange power in not caring. Please stop lying around to feel safe , you have more people that support you of the ones you believe. Second your sexuality do not need to match your identity, look i am a trans lesbian, as you already know I am basically a women attracted to women. I don’t want the masculine energy around me in romantic domains, the only men i want around are trans men, cause are the best men, the pinnacle of a healthy masculinity in most cases. ( or the guys of BTS they also are the very best man), when comes to gay men around is a situation of respect but i do not feel like i have many around, like half of them have a weird combination of toxic masculinity and bitchiness, the other half are very nice… but sometimes i feel something off. Like they get angry cause I am not a gay man… i didn’t choose to be this beautiful androgynous looking being ( just joking). But I understand, there are toxicity inside the lgbtq to, so instead of looking the whole community as unsafe, search for the positive beings inside it. My lesbian friends defended me like lioness every time someone try something weird around me, I do the same for them, when they go on a break up or super drunk i just stay by they’re side and protect them. Is mutual. You are starting is gonna be rough, but one day you will have a well established circle of protection. Now cheer up dude!! Chin up! You gonna do great much love from Switzerland!!

Btw i have a funny theory, I thing that bullying girl Is attracted to you, but as a female. And is pushing you to become what she likes ( very toxic).
I'm so sorry this shit is happening bro
If you think about it though, not only is she wrong but she forgets how manly you actually are, like dude, you transitioned into being a man, and you date other men, that's the manliest manly man to ever man, 200% man, keep going, soon enough you'll be a grown man with a beard and all, voice too, and you'll be able to look another guy in the eyes and say ""back when I was a girl scout..."" and cause fear within them >:)
Depending where you live you could get her in some serious trouble. Like in California purposely deadnaming and misgendering someone is technically sexual harassment and you can bring it up to a teacher.
I mean I feel this. When I went to TDOV a lot of people even some trans people thought I was a cis lesbian and it really broke my heart.
slap her
I feel as everyone should know just because you are LGBTQ doesn’t give u a free pass to hate on transgender people. We are all one community.
This fear has honestly kept me from real life queer places, like I just don't want to deal with it.
Hello many other trans ppl
Um just asking is there a trans and nb flag flair
Invite the bois over, the good ol’ FtM crew, and we’ll just bother the shit out of her. Piss her off till she leaves you alone at least.

Her: “I’m a TERF”
Bois: “Well hey now, we’re all lads here, no need to partake in a cool social circle you don’t deserve brother 😎”
Her: “I’m not a bro-“
Bois: “Hold on broski, macho boys like us gotta keep it real amiright? So why don’t you take your little stinky dude-o-rino attitude and scoot your boot on out of here bruv 😎”
Cis queer people are the worst sometimes :( they always think they have the privilege to misgender you just because they’re not straight
fun fact: she broke up with her bf so for some emotional damage, i could just call her by her ex’s name lols
It doesn't hurt as much
Happy cake day!
Happy cake day!
thank you, honestly you guys are amazing, i feel much easier knowing that there’s a supportive community like y’all
my sister is like that. i told her not to make homophobic jokes and to respect my pronouns but she said that its ok because she is gay :(
truee, the times i have heard the f-slur getting thrown around has been mind-blowing. it’s late 2000s yet again
Oh definitely. Have a cousin who's bisexual who also complained how ridiculous it is that the f-slur and r-slur are considered slurs...after explaining why the r-slur is bad and how it affects me as an autistic person.... I don't hold it too much against her since she was 13 but yikes
I've seen a TON of immature lgbt teens online. There's a lot of kids who seem to want to flex being oppressed while simultaneously being a bully. Seen a lot of them be transphobic as well and claim that they can't be because they're gay or lesbian or something 🤦🏼‍♂️ it's just kids trying to be edgy and bully people like many of them do. Just using different reasons to ""justify"" it.
tysm! honestly true, whenever someone (including me) correct her, i see some nerves twitching on her face. kinda funny ngl
holy shit man, sorry that happened to you :( thankfully i don’t have to go to school for the next two months due to us preparing for this big college application exam so i don’t have to see her until prom. 

and you’re absolutely right, people are learning much more these days and i believe that one day we can all live our lives much more peacefully; THESE people will be made into the butt of the joke, not us.
Okay ***what the actual fuck***
true, there is a reason why it’s called “the lgbtq+ community” we are community that needs to stand together, not a football team where each letter fights against each other until the last standing letter gets a medal or smth
Did you read my mind? Literally came down here to basically post word for word this xD
Arson time?
She fell into my fist
prom is going to be very interesting this year!!
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
I hate the implication that bisexuality doesn't already include trans people. When people say ""I'm pan I like cis and trans people"" it makes me feel so othered and disgusting like they had to make a whole new category just to include me? It's like they're just finding a way to appear inclusive but also solidify that I don't count as a man, I'm some other thing. Like I never thought of myself as trans anything that label is assigned and forced onto me by the world that won't just accept that I'm a man. Most people I've met that describe pan that way (I know that's not what pan means to a lot of people and those ppl are okay) fetishize tf out of trans bodies.
one of the reason i think of myself not having any relationship in the future, the catchphrase "" i'm used to it "" ? that's me. lmao. it sucks but at some point you get pissed. find people who are not asses; you need people.

fun facts:

there is cishet guy at my school that advocated for my name and pronouns without me EVER telling him about it. i'll do anything for that guy to be happy. it was reported to me by a random person. i never met. i love it. in this school, cishet people are more accepting than lgbtq+ to me they don't even invite me to anything lmao.
yeah they have an administration thingy but i live in a more conservative country so i can do nothing really. even then, i want to handle the situation on my own without some authority involved (plus: i have some better friends now days!! people that are not in her friend circle know she’s an ass so—)
same here: for example, i don’t want to make a huge deal out of being trans, that’s just who i am y’know? so rather than “bragging” about or making my entire personality about  something i didn’t choose is not something that sits right w/me
yeah you’re actually right, it’s just generally a thing for some reason that men are less accepting of these things and all. still, guess i shouldn’t’ve used that
okay so i feel like i need to clarify this, i’m not american. and i have this huge exam coming up by the end of the year, it’s more important than any school exam you can take. my school is thankfully helpful and they “assist” us through exams, (let’s not question the legality of it)

so to let us study more for the big exam, they let us go home so we can study in libraries, at home, etc.
god forbid bro,
I'm sorry that's been your experience. I'm a gay dude so not dating bi women, but like, this has not been an apt description of any of the bi women I've ever met. (Not to mention, trans women can also be bi, kind of feel like you ought to have specified cis, as well?)
my gf said go harder and date her ex.

(i highly dont suggest it but that would i guess be a pretty big power move if it wasnt like... unearthly pettiness. especially if he was bi and liked dudes like basically pissing on her grave.

Still dont suggest it but I thought id share the joke to you)
That sounds great
Mix it up with some bro, dude, guy, or buddy
That might be annoying to her ex though, and he seems chill. I'd give her a masculine version of her name (no matter how stupid it sounds)
Like say her name is Jessica, call her Jerry. If her name is Ally, call her Al. Make sure to also use he/him pronouns for her. Calling her ""hey bro"" ""my dude, what's up?"" ""Pretty sure he's gay btw"" etc. Make sure she gets the fucking point.

I usually don't condone misgendering, but transphobes deserve it.
Good idea!
*stretch* go on.
Alternatively let's not let this subreddit turn into /r/teenagers. Don't fight childish highschool tactics with childish highschool tactics. Don't even entertain the hypothetical as a means of therapy. Anyone over the age of 20 will tell you: you won't ""win"", and it won't make you feel better.
or ""[ex's name]'s girlfriend""
You have to fuck her ex.
True but it’s about making a point
Thanks
Thank you
I learned this but well last night and i have to pay it forward dude. So much love from strangers deserves to be something felt by everyone <3
So‽

That's like saying you get an n-word pass cause you're Asian. :/
I think it’s fine for gay people to reclaim gay slurs. It wouldn’t be okay for a cis queer person to use the t slur though because it doesn’t apply to them.
You should do like that one tweet where a dude blew an air horn every time someone misgendered or deadnamed a trans person lmao
how's it goin doppelganger? lmao
indeed
Like how some dudes fall onto shampoo bottles, or cucumbers....or phones
Thank god someone gets it 😭😭
Yeah, same here, I feel like this too nc I just want to be who I am without making a massive fuss yk, I just want to be who I am without ppl questioning it. Hope u get thru this and if anyone needs help dm me and I'm happy to help 😊 I try to be as friendly as possible bc I'm mtf trans so ya ☺️
OHHH OKAY lol way different than the US. Good, I thought you were dealing with transphobia and were like, fuck school, I'm not going to finish high school, and I hoped to talk you out of it lol

Truancy is uh kind of an American thing too.
Ikr but that's what it sounds like she mad for crushing on u so she's mean to u
Idk ive met some fairly vile bi trans women too :/ only difference is that they sexualize me in a slightly less transphobic way :/
""This has not be an apt description of any of the bi women I've ever met""

This to me means that now youre claiming that just because you haven't met any bi women who are chasers (not to mention you're ftm so you wouldn't experience chasers the same way i would) means that NO bi women are chasers??
ooh! ooh! I know! If he's upset with her for breaking up or has negative feelings toward her, offer to help him get back while simultaneously getting back, yourself.

Just pretend to be really close to each other, and he can say stuff like ""Man I'm so glad I don't have her anymore, she's so toxic."" and ""men are better anyway"" or something around her to rub salt in her wounds.
I don't suggest it either

Date her dad instead
Date her ex, and film yourself railing him in front of a giant banner that says ""-------- is a bitch"" get the school to hold an assembly, and switch the videos last second to show the video you made in front of the entire school, then have a large group of friends throw used condoms at her while chanting something that would really piss her off (maybe mention a dead relative) then when she gets home, she walks into her living room to see $200 worth of confetti strewn about.
Happy cake day
you’re kinda right, though i’m taking the piss though dw i’m mindful enough to not get myself into trouble.
That misgendering people you don't like is ok?
I've know some cis bi women who say they are allowed to say the f slur because they've been called it in the past. Ive been called the d slur a ton but I'm a trans gay dude and I personally don't feel right saying that word at all. I don't really get it but people get super defensive about being allowed to say slurs so I just gave up on that fight 😭
I honestly am not okay with the t-slur at all.

no matter who it's coming from.

In fact, I was recently doing an art and I wanted to put the t-slur in it for reason relevant to the art..... I couldn't even bring myself to put it in partially censored.
dude that’s actually brilliant jdnsjcnd
Do you have a link to this?
Now I really want to find this video
When and where king, when and where, ill even bring marshmallows and Graham crackers for smores
Can I join?
Aw, man, that sucks, I'm sorry.
I'm not saying that, and it might not be my place to say. It just seemed like a really broad brush to be painting bi women with. Perhaps it was not my place to comment, and this seems like a sore issue for you, so I'm sorry for pushing.
YES THIS
pffft- hey satan? i just wanted you to know im a really big fan/jk
Thanks
Fuck what this persons saying. In this case, I’d have already punched her teeth in by now, what a c***. Fuck with her and pour that salt right into her transphobic wounds as much as you can.
Calling someone the wrong name isn’t misgendering. The point is it’s still annoying, and he should stick up for himself
I also don’t feel comfortable with it, but I’m not gonna take the option away from other trans people who have been affected.
I only think it’s good in like a radical political context, it otherwise feels just wrong
I'm sure she'd shut up REAL quick 😂🤭
at midnight when they least expect it, then we celebrate it with the leftover drinks we got from our enemies
everyone’s invited!
Him: ""I can't believe I ever actually *liked* her!"" audibly shudders ""Such a terrible woman. Just generally unpleasant.""

OP: ""Yeah and how she treated me was pretty awful""

Him: ""Exactly! She needs to learn how to behave around people. Seriously""
Happy Cake Day!
Ooh forbidden punch?
Bet count me in I’ll grab my blowtorch and katana
Thank you
Make sure you bring some snacks
Happy Cake Day!  Is it carrot cake?  If so, can I have some?
Oh yeah ill get the pickles and scones
Sorry rum cake

2 beautiful trans women murdered this is so sad the transphobia has got to stop please 🙏🏳️‍⚧️🥺💔		"Who's picture 2, sorry? I've only heard about Brianna :(
I had only heard about Brianna. This is so sad, it needs to stop 💔
I never understand things like that. Killing someone for being different tells me, some members of the humanity still live in stone age.
https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2023/2/7/23590217/prosecutors-decline-to-charge-teen-arrested-in-mass-shooting-at-south-shore-apartment

Nobody was charged in Unique and her moms killing yet, they let the suspect go. The suspects lived in the same apartment complex so standard robbery seems super unlikely to me. Three other trans people shot but lived
This is unacceptable people need to do something about this, i can get do angry about this stuff please everyone be careful and stay safe ❤️
It truly is a sad time for their families and the transgender community. 

I saw YouTube commenters saying they ""couldn't believe Brianna wasn't a real girl."" Even in death people can't show respect she was a woman. Makes me angry people are compelled to define gender above the horrible tragedy. 

Transphobia is getting more alarming everyday.
I didn’t realize Brianna’s hair was so long! They said that she had been going as she for a few years but that’s at *least* 5-6 years of growth! She’s known longer than the media had led us to believe!
This is so sad 😞 
Please be careful out there sisters! 🫂
Then there are people that say that transgender people are the ones that are dangerous... for God's sake, people that say this nonsense are the ones that are dangerous!
You know, screw the crap about hate. Hate and judging over someone who's obese, transgender, gay or lesbian? What the fuck does it matter? Fuck the religion and the extremists. Why can't people simply think for themselves! Why can't we all just respect each other and be polite. Be proud of who you are. Stand out from the crowd. Show the mindless brainwashed sheep who we truly are and that we won't take this kind of abuse.

You don't have to be LGBTQ or Transgender or White or Black. You just have to be someone who believes in respect.
brianna is so pretty with a bun like that 🫤
Today they are my Valentines, I hope their tragedy does not go unnoticed.
It's tragic, doesn't matter if trans or cis, no one deserves to die in this manner. May they rest in peace.
🥀
This is heartbreaking so many times out there I never feel safe as a transgender woman. Being sexually harassed, robbed etc
Reports said Unique was at least the third this year that we know of. Which means Brianna is at least the 4th. 😢
Terrible... makes me so sad💔
Absolutely heartbreaking. No one should have to die for simply being themselves.
Guys. Always carry around pepper spray for these kinds of things because you'll never know if it might happen to you

Rest in peace 😔
How many more need to die before people start rioting?

Or is it just that cis people don't care about us?
can we just... stop murder? all together? y'know just any kind of harm to other people is just... can we not please? i don't understand the mindset behind the sick freaks who do shit like this, what does it mentally take to look at someone just living their life and decide ""no, abso-fucking-lutely not"". who in the hell has any right to decide one person has more of a right to live just because of some random detail? 

the fact people like that even EXIST and may even walk the same streets i do is horrific...
These girls will both be haunting all the sick fucks in their dreams tonight who are making fun of their deaths 💯. 🏳️‍⚧️🙏🏼
May they rest in peace... be safe everyone
I so sad that the world has so many unkind people
sad times we live in
Heart breaking!
This is so sad :(. This is so horrible, no one should die because they're trans. I hope that one day all trans people can live their lives without fear of being murdered.
:(
Again, I’m so sad to read this. Rest easy girls, we will keep up the fight so this stops. You will be missed! 😥😥
It's not just trans... the world is becoming an angry place
🥺so sad they need to stop killing us 😔
We have to fucking arm ourselves, sisters. They won't stop unless we stop them
This is why I hate people in general
First, I’ve heard of this. I cannot believe it did not make main stream media.
Arm yourself, if possible, and keep your heads on a swivel. Unfortunately, this is the only advice I can really suggest.

That's the same person. Is it not?
Who's the second one? I hadn't heard about another one.
So very sad 😢
R I p
Who’s the second girl I olny know about Brianna
😭
I'm sure that these two of our sisters are now in the light of God. May they rest in peace waiting for the Eternal Embrace. It won't be goodbye, for those who have been loved. Even though I've never met them, I love them. Goodbye in the light of joy.
So much hate in this world. Very hard to comprehend. Sending love to their families 💕💕💕
2? they look like the same person?
Unique Banks.
That's so sad. I hope the people responsible are delt with severely.
More like some people haven't mentally progressed past being a toddler with no self control.
We're seeing a really weird trend (at least in my eyes). We're somehow becoming less empathetic while also being more empathetic and it's bizarre. People are becoming more inclusive and aware of how different life is for everyone, and a lot of people are understanding and sympathetic for people different from them.

However, in the same breath, these people cannot relate to others in those different areas and it makes them think very narrow about how things need to be. Meanwhile, less parents are teaching their children empathy, making the kids more self centered and selfish, unable to see things in a different perspective. And the people who are openly more closed minded are becoming more vocal and more widely known, making this cycle far worse.

It's fucking weird...

For example, we learned about gender and sexuality in one of my nursing classes. Teachers are all nice and very gender inclusive. However, I don't feel comfortable with any pronouns or names. I'm also the only non cis gender person in the class (lot of other GSRM people though regardless, I have accidentally befriended them without knowing lol). So everyone says their name and pronouns except for me, and the teachers became very adamant on knowing what I prefer. I told them later it's complicated and they understood, but just couldn't figure out how to proceed because the name and pronouns are mandatory, and can't understand why I can't stick by one set/name.

Awesome people, very inclusive, love them to bits. but having something just slightly different from what they were taught confuses them and, thusly, they don't know what to do or how to react.
probably older cultures were more humanitarian than conservatives.
Released without charges!? The actual fucking fuck?!
In all fairness, I had my hair long way before I came out. Might be a similar case here.
They want nothing short of genocide. We need to be louder even if it’s tempting to hide.
I agree with you but here is one that got me triggered.
Upstairs right above me is lgtbq+ group of people. There are two gay guys, one nb, and a over weight trans male. They all live in place above ours  but at all hours of night there is banging, thumps, and loud music being played. They are all white as well.

Now I'm a first nation transwoman my wife is cis woman black and my kids are all mixed. When we put on our echo dot on music we get told to turn it off but when we complain nothing happens. Same with down stairs right now we hear there loud TV playing cnn, even one time they smoked our place out with a charcoal BBQ pit right under our balcony where our ac was sucking in all its smoke. Even the lease says no charcoal or gas pits aloud.  But they still have it and nothing happened I got sent to hospital for smoke inhalation luck the rest of family was ok.
it did(cant say for local news stuff). she was either entirely misgendered and deadnamed or they didn't mention the fact that she was trans at all.
Brianna was British and 16, it's all well and good saying ""just carry!"" but the majority of trans people do not have access.
Also, nor should we have to carry just so we aren't murdered for being something you challenge.
She wasn't from the USA, developed countries usually ban guns
I'm sorry what?
This happened in the uk in the city I work at, we shouldn't have to live in fear and carrying any form of weapon no matter the intention is a crime.
Love Americans just assuming that every major event takes place in America
I don't want 'murderers' added to the list of trans stereotypes

> Unique’s death is at least the third violent killing of a transgender or gender non-conforming person in 2023. We say “at least” because too often these deaths go unreported — or misreported.

> Unique was killed in a mass shooting that also took the life of her mother, Alexsandra Olmo. Alexsandra’s boyfriend and two other transgender women survived the attack but were hospitalized in critical condition.

It was targeted. Two more trans women almost died in the same attack.
[removed]
Yeah. Other ancient cultures had 3rd genders. I think I heard of some god that was said to ""turn women into men, and men into women"" but I'm not sure how accurate that is.
Lol working together is a great way to survive
Case is still open though so there is more to it but yeah. And if I read correctly, at least one of the victims identified suspect in a lineup. It could also have to do with them classifying it as a robbery when it likely wasn't because the suspect lived in the same complex
🇺🇲America🇺🇲 the land where nobody gets rights except the obscenely privileged.
I did that! Starting growing mine at 14, came out at 19, and that was 8 years ago!
But free*doom* and stuff…
Agreed. Have carried in the past out of fear and do now (not a blade or a gun, but still not good I know) as I've recently been targeted for being trans and don't plan on being caught out. But it feels awful, I don't feel safe! If anything it's more stress knowing that I'll be the one who's fucked if I use it even if it's in self defense unfortunately though I'd rather be in prison than dead so necessary evil...
And that guns solve every problem
I swear, people in this country are so dumb. Like anyone can be swayed by media, but like idk the people im around daily in the US, are TOO swayed by media. Crazy state I swear.
What did they say, I'm curious.
I just looked through their (short) comment history. This is the first one with any ""substance"", looks like a chaser otherwise. I think those who view others as merely sexual objects need therapy in a bad way. Us just BEING doesn't represent any tangible harm whatsoever.
Thanks.
Swipe left.
Ishtar
But it that happens that's usually cause for a warrant, not dismissal!
I don't see how them living in the same complex means it couldn't have been a robbery, like every time I've been robbed it's been some dumb mfr who lives literally down the street.
Yeah the land of the free as long as you aren’t a minority
I know I had mine long from 3rd-5th grade, then my mom made me cut it short for her wedding, I threw a fit, but in the end, the parent always wins. Then I just grew it back out and it's been long ever since.
Yucky. Chasers are the worst. I completely agree with you.
OK I see, apologies
I agree. Something is going on and nobody, not even the family is being given any information. I have a small amount of faith that the authorities are doing the right thing. A very small ammount.
I think it ""likely wasn't"" a robbery. People generally try not to s**t where they eat. They probably knew of the cameras because they live there. Most likely chance of being recognized by neighbors. There are a lot of reasons."	111wwh8	trans	2036	0.99	2023-02-14 07:33:52
Encountered so many transphobic comments last days in public.. does it look really that bad?! im curious...and sad. pre everything.		"Can't see how they'd clock you? You genuinely look amazing/feminine..!!

Unless they're noticing any mannerisms, that could be seen as non female?? Can only be something like that as looks wise I wouldn't think twice, that's a woman in the picture 👍😁
So sorry.   You are gorgeous.   Be strong and know you are supported and loved
I had to check the sub reddit because I genuinely for a moment was like huh? Why transphobic comments at such a gorgeous woman? 😅
Pre everything!   So pretty, I’m jealous
You’re beautiful and I’m sorry you had to deal with that
You look fantastic, don't let the dickheads get you down.
How could they even tell?
Not even slightly. You're lovely. Feck the haters.
You’re pretty girl but it’s not just about the way you look it’s about the way you walk, the way you carry yourself, how you wear your clothes, it takes time really.

If I wear a baggy pair of pants, or my hair down, or if I forget to wear earring I’ll get clocked.

I’m really sorry lady but it’s just a part of the progress and it’ll get better I promise.
You look amazing!
I genuinely thought you already started hrt
You look cute.  Don't let their ignorance tell you different.
You're really cute <3   
Sorry you have to deal with shitty people :-(
You look great! Haters are just jerks. 💖
Wait your trans
Honey, some of them are sexually attracted to you and upset about it. The others are jealous of you. There is some overlap between the two groups. Don’t let it bring you down.
You look gorgeous and super cute I say,
Not only do you look beautiful, your look glows with a beautiful heart. As hard as it is, hopefully that will shine bright enough to get you through.
No. You Look really good.
PRE?!?!!?!! I am literally so jealous I wish I could pass that well!
The haircut and makeup suit you. It‘s definitely not that. Looks cute.
You look gorgeous , Just try to ignore people who are like that I personally go to the same thing being FTM and pre everything just try to not let it get to you and just know that you are beautiful
? Ok?  You look great, people are just shite.
You look amazing and the people you've had to deal with are total assholes. Forget them, I wish I looked half as good as you do
Im sorry girl, ppl suck. Im going to fist fight transphobes in the mcdonalds parkinglot. 😤  you're beutiful dont let assholes bring you down.
As someone who feels genuinely harsh when it come to trans feminine beauty, I can safely say you do in fact look gorgeous. Maybe the voice is just setting people off. Either way I wouldn't let it cut you too deep. You've had to fight a long way to get here, and you deserve to be the beautiful happy you that you've always been!
 You are beautiful. Transphobes are disgusting, I'm sorry that happened to you.
Soo... it's really hard to tell how someone comes off IRL just from pictures. As other people have said, your photo looks really good. There are so many other things that might ""give someone away"" in real life, like your voice, mannerisms, frame, etc. On the positive side, considering how good you look in pictures, it's only going to get better from here once you start HRT. It's a frustrating part of being trans that it can take a lot of time and effort to get to a place where you pass consistently. Either way you absolutely don't deserve the hate. Fuck those people. You are brave to be yourself in public even with all the hate. I'm sorry you've dealt with that
no ur beautiful tell them to shut up
You look like you pass, although we can’t tell without your mannerisms and voice. Transphobes are assholes, they won’t be appeased even if you 100% pass.
girllllll I would not be able to tell you're trans meeting you in person. I only figured it out with the caption then at least ten seconds of thought. that's a picture of a woman, alright! definitely didn't deserve a word of that hate.
Cute femme look
Oh my goddd, you look absolutely beautiful! Firstly, your makeup is fantastic. Secondly, those people have to be blind cause all I’m seeing is a gorgeous woman. <333
Haters are just haters u look great. Would like to see u with the mask on perfect I'm starting to love women wearing masks
I think the only thing is the hairline is a bit high. But if you haven't even started HRT, the good news it some of that will actually come back. I think overall you look very feminine.
Uhh, genuinely no, you don’t look bad at all. You look gorgeous, actually. People confuse me
You are stunning.  They are jealous and I am smitten.
I am a white cis hetero male in my 30s. As far as I know that would stereotypically make me one of the most likely people to misgender you.

You are the most convincing trans woman that I'm aware of ever having seen, and if I hadn't been told you were trans, I very strongly doubt I would have guessed it.
I really don't understand how people who pass extremely well and are so pretty get active transphobia but I, who barely pass, get none. To my face anyway.
I’m a 66 year old heterosexual male. I have no idea why anyone would feel compelled to comment on someone else’s perceived sexuality. I’m sorry you have had to endure such abuse. I guess it’s true, you can’t fix stupid
I'm not out about transitioning yet like publically. What all have people said? Ugh. Sorry that's happening..
Your makeup is really pretty.  You look fantastic to my eyes
You look great to me. Love the hair! You're beautiful inside and out.
[removed]
People are shit, and I'm sorry it's rough right now.

But your lippy & eyes are right on point, and make you look amazing.
no, you look amazing! people are just assholes. ignore them, you look beautiful <3
So i really tried to find something bad about your photos because i sometimes feel this sub is overly positive and I wanted to give an honest opinion. And you look gorgeous! I wouldn't be able to tell you are not cis when i were to see you on the streets tbh. You look feminine to me and i think quite a few of us wish they'd look like you :)
You look great!
OMG, you're amazingly beautiful. I don't understand why anyone would make comments. You're gorgeous. I'd definitely try to get to know you if we met in public😁
They must be people you know that are a holes as strangers would never notice
Girl your awesome looking. I wish I looked like you pre hrt. I'm sorry assholes say transphobic garbage at you but always remember they arent reflecting your image but their ugly soul 💙💜⚪💜💙
You're super pretty!
from those pictures i have no idea how anyone would ""clock"" you...
Honestly, if they sent you transphobic comments, they probably say transphobic shit at a lot of cis women.
Your beautiful in every way don't listen to the Your an absolute stunner
You are beautiful and that lipstick really suits you. Transphobes are terrible - I’m sorry that happened to you.
I genuinely can’t find any ‘tells’ from your pictures. I haven’t a clue why they would’ve said those things.
Ignore them. You look AMAZING ❤️❤️
People hate because they know nothing else. That is now way a reflection on you.
You pass perfectly, I was confused weather you were mtf or not for a minute (I assume you are based off of context)
You look amazing they’re just assholes 💖
You can’t take their opinions seriously. They are horrible to the people they love as well.
Girl, honestly- you look fab. I don't believe that from just looking at you anybody would possibly be able to clock you. As somebody else has said, if they're clocking you then perhaps it's your mannerisms, but it's certainly not the way you look
You're cute af! Anyone saying negative things can fuck off. Keep doin you! 😀
Unless they clocked you by voice or no boobie i don’t know how they would’ve known, you look good
I’m sorry people were mean to you.
You're genuinely so gorgeous don't listen to them!!! If you need to talk I'm here :)
It’s not your appearance that’s for sure. But perhaps people clock you on your voice or other things.
oh honey you are beautiful I wish I looked half as good as you do
if i thought otherwise i would probably leave some type of tip but I genuinely think you are very passing... I'm sorry that you had to hear such negative comments <3 ):
You look really good!
no? you totally pass.
You genuinely look like a cis woman. Anyone who says you’re not a woman has a very smooth brain
If you’re not wearing one, you could try wearing a padded bra, and practicing a more feminine voice:

https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/mgaci7/solid_introductory_voice_training_resources/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

If you said you were cis, I’d believe you without a doubt. It’s probably the small things as other commenters say. Best of luck, don’t listen to the insecure transphobes
It's not your face or hair. Your very pretty.
Woah! You look so pretty! Ngl, based on your picture, if this wasn't a trans subreddit, my first thought would have been, ""wait, you're trans?"" (with me interpreting you as a woman)
You are a beautiful young woman (if you identify as such) and to be honest I'm a little jealous, lol. I'm 33 and transitioned 2.5 years ago. May I ask what city, state or country you live in because I live in Texas and I've got ugly looks quite regular but no-one has ever blatantly said anything to my face. I'm certain it happens maybe I've been blessed or lucky so far but I carry military grade mace with me at all times and I'm licensed to carry even though I do **NOT** like guns just because of the state I live in (sad reality in the U.S.). I'm passable but you can still tell I'm trans if you really look and even at the beginning of my transition I was working at the Austin (Travis) county courthouse and even there I used the bathroom of my choosing with no problems even though to this day it gives me pretty extreme anxiety just worrying about someone who might verbally or physically attack me, sadly. Now I don't have to worry about so called bathroom bills even here in Texas because I legally changed my gender here In Texas and all my legal documents say I'm female. Even though its illegal here in Texas for someone to ask for ID to see what gender you are I still worry about it. Don't worry about those haters as much as you can because as my Momma always says... ""If haters are hating it only means you are doing something right."" Best wishes friend and much love. <3
I’m sorry honey. I don’t see it, I see a beautiful young woman. But my heart and soul feels for you. I’m not quite at the point where you are yet, but I pray for kind people and not the knuckleheads you dealt with.

Fuck them, you got this girl
You look very natural and femme to me! Its shocking to me that anyone is doing that to you?! Are the comments coming from family members or others that know your past or complete strangers??
You look ladylike. I'm curious to know how you will look post 2 years HRT.
You look all girl! Coming from a post op of a few years.
Oh honey you're gorgeous, transphobia is so shitty but you're doing amazing and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, keep up benig yourself every day.
I dont know what happened before but from what i can tell, you look very pretty :)
Transphobic people are absolute assholes, don't let them get to you and know that you are beautiful
I think you look lovely.
I think you look beautiful!
I'm so sorry you had to deal with that... Your makeup game tho! - It's amazing, hopefully you get to start HRT soon! You're gonna be gorgeous!
You look beautiful <3
No it's 100% them.  
You look absolutely fem, without a doubt.
PRE EVERYTHING?!?

Straight up first glance at you I thought you were either ftm or fully/close to fully transitioned
Honey, you're beautiful
Well rn we can only see your face, so if it's something else we won't know, but from what I see you definitely pass, so consider me confused.
I really couldn't tell (and you're soo prettyy), so maybe it was mannerisms? In any case though don't let them get to you, you're beautiful <3
You look great! If you're being clocked I would presume it's your voice or mannerisms, as some others have mentioned. It doesn't take much of a change in mannerisms to start passing, but voice can be a pain.
You look fine to me.
Like I’m confused- what about you isn’t feminine?!? People are crazy. You look beautiful.
Wait, what? How???? You look so pretty and feminine, I don’t even understand how a passing stranger would realize you’re trans!
Don’t be sad… put a BiG ScoOp of ice-cream on top of what everyone here is saying and dance!!! 🏳️‍⚧️🍧🍬…p.s… guck those jealous haters!
Nah you pass well
Just be yourself and enjoy life
I cant see anything about you that says anything other than female. also little jealous  of the fact you are pre everything and look so beautiful.
You are a very attractive woman, don't let the naysayers get you down xx
omg you are so beautiful i hope to be as pretty as you someday
Yes
You look like my roommates (cis) sister. So I'd say you're good.
They must be blind because all I see is a beautiful Women here. 😊😊❤️❤️
You are pretty don’t let them bring you down there just hating honey
Omg you look amazing 🤘
That's super rude of them, you look great! Also sidenote, about the only reason people fear being visibly trans is because of the way people treat them for it. Most of the time it's pretty awesome, so don't let people get to you too much! I know it's easier said than done.
You genuinely look great hun!
You look amazing! Fk em all!! Mean ppl suck!!
You're beautiful I see nothing but a woman there, You don't deserve any hate for being you
As a straight white guy, with very little experience of the transgender community, I geniunly could not tell. Live it, and love it.
Love your makeup
You just look like any other girl to me to be honest. Idk how anyone would be able to tell
I think you are an amazing human being and that you should be able to live your life to the fullest, don’t listen to them, you look awesome.
you look beautiful

we're in an era where people are just horrible just because.

find a way to purge the negativity and keep on moving. don't let the haters bring you down!
If i saw you i would think that you were afab and im not just saying that to make you fell better i mean it
You look great. Very pretty. Fuck those hateful bastards.
Maybe your voice, because you pass in these pics
You look amazing! That hair, face, and skin look very good together. You look like a girl, because you are one.
How, how do they know?! I woud say you 90% pass
You look quite passable and very pretty. I’m sorry you have had to deal with assholes out in the world.
For being pre everything, you're looking hella femme to me.
You're a cutie pie, a beautiful woman 💖
What? Based on this photo I can see girl. But hard to say what Exactly Is pointing in your behavior And movements in Real life that you Are identified As male.
I personally can’t see it and wouldn’t look twice, your a really pretty woman just fück what everyone else thinks and be yourself, their opinions don’t matter
Are you pre hormons? I could never tell. You look very girly, if i saw you in the street i'll think that you are a cis girl. :3
From one of your replies I understood you live in Germany. I honestly did not expect that! I’m starting to get used of all the transphobic bigotry coming from the US so I kinda presumed you lived there too, but seriously Germany?? I thought it was much more accepting as (neighboring country) the Netherlands (where I live). 

Ever since I came out last June as myself and presented myself that way I haven’t gotten a single transphobic remark (yet! Fingers crossed) though I don’t pass by a long shot so I know for a fact that everywhere I go people will know.
 
I honestly don’t see how others could clock you! You look so lovely it really saddens me you are treated this way!
I was wondering though what kind of people make these transphobic remarks to you? Are these youngsters, elderly ppl or perhaps ppl with a different cultural background?

Also if you don’t mind saying, what kind of stuff did they say to you? 

As a r/trans mod I’ve had several death treats already so maybe I’m kinda numbed out emotionally but it really increased my mental shield to be able to withstand transphobia but like I said I’ve never been called out in real life only online and I totally understand the difference there. 

In the near future it’s quite possible that as a musician I’ll be performing in Germany and I like to prepare my self for what people might say to me there. 

If it’s too much for you to talk about I understand though! Anyway I think you are awesome and you deserve all the love and happiness your heart can carry!!💕
You. Look. Amazing!! 

Don't let those petty morons tell you otherwise, you look great 🥰💕
No, people are hateful and unfortunately trans people women in particular are the hate flavour right now.

There are a lot of us who have your back though, we are fighting for our sisters in the way we work, socialize and vote. 

I hope someday we look back at this time and cringe. 

Until then stay beautiful and stay you.
Gurl you look amazing!! Unfortunately in the society we live in, we gotta deal with this shit, but keep on being strong, you’re not alone 💗
I hate that you’ve had a hard time. I think you look beautiful and pass really well, I can’t believe you’re pre everything!? Sending love❤️
You're stunning girl, transphobes are lower than filth that don't deserve the thoughts of a strong Queen!
Why would they do you like that yo? Ya lookin cute a gorgeous as hell!
I think they’re just jealous that they’ll never be as pretty as you.
You are hot!!
You're gorgeous!! :*
Look bad ?! LOOK BAD ???!!!! YOU LOOK AWFULLY BEAUTIFUL DARLING !
You look like lots of lovely ladies I've seen in the world! I'm sorry you had a bad experience but you look great to me.
I would not be able to clock you. Does the filter drastically alter your face? I have no idea how they'd know otherwise.
You look very gorgeous! People are jealous just because their lives is very miserable. Keep being you and enjoy life!
I dunno, madam. I just see a beautiful woman.
No? My wife came out as trans yesterday and we’ve been looking at before/after photos (hopefully that’s the right term) and I really cannot tell at all. You are gorgeous.
Ma'am, you're gorgeous. If someone says the opposite, punch it in the face.
Just ignore them, your beautiful !
Pre everything? You look amazing! No idea why anyone would say anything unflattering about you. I hate the idea of ""passing"" but judging by this picture you totally do
You look wonderful
Alot of the haters are just too afraid to explore there own sexuality it has nothing to do with your strength in expressing who you are as a person you just be you and do what makes you happy and you look stunning by the way
Ummm whoever says those to you definitely needs their eyes checked. The only thing they can clock you over is if they see your manners or voice isn't lady-like. But regardless, you're genuinely looking like a cis woman, just how I genuinely look like a cis woman! 🤗💜
No idea how you look like a gal to me
If you looked liked you do in the photo, you look amazing
pre EVERYTHING? you look so lovely. blessed with a feminine face and your make up is stellar
Legitimately no clue hoe they'd even know. You look tired, do they think women can't be tired???? Wat
I think you look great.
Started to look for a job presenting fem and I wished I looked as good as you 😘
I would never have known- I think you are beautiful 😍
You look amazing girl. 
Don’t get down by small minded idiots.
You will receive negative comments, they are mad you are happy with yourself
You look good to me
It doesnt look bad... idk why they said them...
Honestly if I saw you on the street, i wouldnt even clock you. 
I even covered where the mask would be and from your nose up, your eyes and hair are very feminine.
Im so sorry you had to deal with that :( 
I'm pre everything too (but ftm) and  I totally understand how stressful it is trying to pass or at least avoid hateful bigots. It really sucks
You look beautiful and feminine . Not seeing what they saw.

Just FYI, love the energy, but being transgender is not a sexuality. Trans women can be straight, gay (ie lesbians), bi, asexual, or any other sexuality.

uhmm.. i did just get offended beeing an ugly fetish male you should stay away from their kids.. after i walked out the bus someone else spit me on the leg, but to be fair.. i dont know if the second thing was on purpose.. it still felt like it....

Aww what a wonderful message :3   
First of all i want to apologize, english is not my native language so i hope you do understand everything or at least as much as possible! x33

&#x200B;

Im really gald that you did not encounter reallife harrasment. I hope i continues like that and you will do your thing and live a happy life <3

&#x200B;

I honestly do understand when people clock me without a mask or fitting clothes or other stuff.. since i cannot effort many things right now im pretty limited about makeup and clothes but im doing my best all the time to feel as best as I can. What I do not understand is, even when people say im passing, due i got a good frontprofile (at least in some angles in my opinion), but im really fuc\*\*d up about my side profile. (Got a big nose and an not sooo fitting forehead and chin) EVEN then I do absolutley NOT UNDERSTAND how people do say such things while im wearing a mask, sitting in an bus (with an jacket over an long dress) and actually doing nothing but sitting there. I wish I knew. Really. I would make it better in an instant.

&#x200B;

\[Situation: As i said i was sitting in the bus (in the front). A small family entered ( Father, Mother, 2 children). The children were somehow turned up a bit and tried to talk to me. bus besided buying a ticket) I just looked at them as they almost sit next to me, and i did throw a smile trought the mask. ( I did not take it off) I turned my head away as the Mum said ""Go away there"" in an energetic way.

They all passed me as I heared them loud talking ( i swear to god that the whole bus could hear that stuff.....) to their children. They said im dangerous cause im mentaly disturbed and people call something like me an ill fetishist. Im a ill person who should get locked up. They talked about it a bit more but I tried to ignore it and didnt listen to everything as i couldnt explain everything well in english. x.x Ouh yea and as i left the bus somebody else spat on my leg. ( I dont know if it was on purpose due i moved my leg on the point he aimed and i didnt recognise. still.. he didnt apologize and left.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To be fair it was an extreme case. and something soooo dumb didnt happen to me before. ( The only other thing was an bus driver who did not want me to buy a ticket cause he will not take money from ""something"" like me. And i dont even know how he wanted to harrass me like that.. due i just got a free ride then i thought. x3)

&#x200B;

Besides these cases... everyone treated me kind and nice. And it makes me so happy since even people in my village do treat me good even after my coming out. ;////;

Sooo.. sorry for the long bad written text.. i hope u will have an nice concert in germany!

And dont be afraid. Most of germans are nice or they just dont care x333
i think its just auto filter from my regular handycam. I do take photos with it to actually get a less filtered example of me. But yea honestly it does make my skin a bit more clean nothing else I think. Thank youuu ♥
;\_; thank youuuu ♥
huh?

Hey let's not say stuff like that
Facts!
And apparently people agree by the upvotes! You're welcome 💙
No I'm genuinely confused your trans
My pleasure! I totally mean it. Every girl who has been brave enough to be herself despite all the anguish that comes with it is truly a Wonder Woman. You are seriously, objectively gorgeous physically and never let them tell you otherwise. And. as for your beautiful spirit, that will hover over everyone who has the pleasure of knowing you.
Aw, thank you! I definitely need to get it in another size though lol, it shouldn't be that hard to get my arms into it
no problemo sister
thanks to make that clear! i didnt take the post offensiv so i hope u dont worry about that! <3 

anyways..! thank you a lot i really appreciate your support ♥
Luckily no violence... I read a lot of stories about that. It's really frustrating how people are still this shallow. One of many reasons I'm getting my CCW soon, the threat of violence. Better to be safe than sorry.
of course! you’re so valid, you should have everyone’s support! have an amazing day <3
Ughhh such dickheads. Just so you know, I am a ciswoman (here as I want to be supportive of a trans sibling), and I get called a man on a regular basis. At work, by girls that are jealous of me, by men that try their luck and cant have me because im not interested. Sometimes because im wearing shorts and jm thin, sometimes when Im curvy but have broad shoulders, when I can beat them at a race...so pathetic. 

It can ALWAYS be something else. It will rarely be because you look like someone other than your authentic self. 

It doesnt matter than I feel absolutely gorgeous as they dont like that haha. They are so insecure its like they get a boost from it. 

So please dont dwell on it, I dont. As a woman, they dont like us being happy with ourselves and they thrive on stealing that light
Anytime!
You did mention pre everything? No hrt yet? Once you get that going you will see some great changes and experience some euphoria. Softer skin, subtle changes in your face and some curves! Growing your own breasts is a incredible feeling for most trans girls!
For some of us it is the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.
You are most welcome ❤️
Oh geez Germany? I wouldn't even have an idea, I'm in Canada
Geez that sounds horrible! 

That mother is clearly uneducated and that bus driver is one complaint away from getting his ass fired!
Totally unacceptable! But yeah I get that it’s not the time or place to start an argument about it.
If you remember the day and date plus the bus number you could file a complaint through!

I’m glad you have much support though and can be happy:) stay safe💕
You pass incredibly well. And transphobes are scum.

wonder what the person did say o.o.. just curious.. :<
actually i do feel like its kinda obv that iam trans :o
Sorry I hadn't said anything else, everyone else had already said what I thought. 

That said, you are looking great! You just have just had a bad run of douchebags who happened to catch you in a weird moment, cos you look unclockable in the photos
thank you so much for that beautiful message.. ♡
it is appreciated sooo much.
*smile*
Thank you so much! You're probably right about these 2 people. I already did file a complain trought! Ofc they cant tell me what happened to him due privacy. 

I only can thrwo ur words back. Please enjoy ur life as much as u can and stay happy and safe! ♥♥♥\~

I hate how our community is seen and portrayed	"I was watching ""my crazy ex"" and this episode comes on where ""Brian comes Brianna"" , and I hate how it's implied that trans people are first of all ""crazy"" by the title and also that we are ""deceptive"". I also hate how so many people would leave or be repulsed by their partner if they came out as trans. I believe if you love someone you love someone for who they are , not the meat suit we live on this earth in. It just makes me sad"	"I HATE the idea that trans people are deceptive
[deleted]
I grew up with trans people being depicted to me as Buffalo Bill and Garrison from South Park. I'm willing to bet a vast majority of transphobia probably comes from the way we're depicted in movies and tv
Seriously, the old 70s 80s sitcom story where the old college buddy comes back as a woman 20 years later, was way more deep and heartfelt than what we are spoonfed these days by the ""diverse"" media.
When I finally came to terms with who I am, I told my ex.  I loved her and trusted her more than any other person.  She quickly fell into a pattern of saying that I deceived her and that our twenty year marriage was a lie.  
She still clings to that narrative and says it was the worst thing I could do to her.
Are used to love no one can hear you episode of adventure time but Jake when he’s supposed to be insane says I’m a woman which makes me cringe
While I agree with your statements I give a pass to married partners who choose to separate after one comes out as trans.

My wife married a male and is attracted to men. She would not have married me if I had transitioned prior to us meeting. Had I known I was trans prior to our dating she would not have married me. The reason she wouldn’t marry me is the same reason she wouldn’t marry her best friend who is female. She just isn’t sexually attracted to women. 

Given other statements in this thread I feel I also need to state that genital preferences are not transphobic. I have specific characteristics I’m attracted to and while I don’t have a genital preference I have other physical preferences and would not date specific people based on those purely physical preferences.

Now I do judge all the partners out there who can’t maintain a friendship with the trans ex. The person didn’t change the outside did. The person should still be quite capable of being a friend.

I doubt my wife and I will stay married but I also think we will stay friends very likely close friends.
I’m not familiar with the show, but I do know that the hard reality is that our beloveds tend to bail on us when we begin to live authentically. 

“For richer, for poorer,
For better or worse,
In sickness and in health,
Till death do us part”*

. . . apparently has a huuuuge asterisk, namely, *unless trans. Trans voids all warranties, express or implied.
I fucking HATED this episode
When I think back to my childhood. Ace Ventura and Jerry Springer being my first representation of trans people. And the way the revelation of them being trans was portrayed.. it was so awful. I remember thinking I better make sure I don’t end up like that. Even the frickin dolphin was disgusted. And then there was absolutely no academic explanation done in school. Just whatever awful rumor you heard from the other kids about what a trans person is or why they’re that way. No more generations of children should have the same experience.
As someone who is married and transitioning, know that if you found the right one, they will support you. If they don’t support you, they aren’t the right one. The person who loves you will love you for you and I hope with all my being that you all will find it too.
Coming out and transitioning was this almost transcendent experience for me, gender and sexuality became almost meaningless as I realized that I could be whoever I wanted and love whoever I wanted. The majority of people aren't like this though, but it's not my business to judge them or force them to think and feel like I do. Love and sexuality is what it is, you can't help who you like or don't like.
Lmao ""meat suit."" Truer words have never been spoken
ugh yeah this type of representation is honestly almost worse than none at all. it’s so painful to watch. i’m so tired of hearing it implied that a trans person is trying to ‘trick’ someone or that  being trans is deceitful. 

not for this show (tbh i only watched one episode and it was a bit yikes) but i especially hate it in shows/movies/books when someone who was stealth comes out or is outed and everyone’s like you were lying about who you are, or even the theme/lesson the character learns is that they should’ve been being true to themselves. THEY WERE BEING TRUE TO THEMSELVES. honesty doesn’t mean telling everyone what your genitals look like or your gender history.
Maybe younger me would be scared and confused, but nowadays idc if your trans if I like you I'll fuck ya
As someone going through a divorce due to coming out as trans, this hit a little too close to home... But I 100% agree

Edit: stupid autocorrect
Yeah, I agree.
I used to be scared about the topic and was unable to face my identity for a long time because of how it was portrayed in my youth/childhood. I realized that I was avoiding this topic because I always feared how it was portrayed. There was a trans character in some story? I was immediately nervous. Often I was unable to stick around to see where this was going. I did not understand why, because I was unable to face my own feelings.

Over the years the experiences shared by actual trans folks helped me finally understand what being trans actually means, and this allowed me to accept myself. But I still feel like I have a lot of work to do to overcome previous misconceptions.
I don't remember an episode with a trans character and googling for a Brian or Brianna brings up nothing, so I can't speak to that, but... the crazy in the title doesn't refer to a random one off character, it's about the main character (obviously?) who is played by the shows creator, someone who lives with mental illness and is essentially owning the word crazy. Mental illness is a major theme explored in the show. 

As far as people leaving their partners when they come out... I'm sorry, it's an unfortunate part of life but it's just not realistic to expect someone to continue to stay with someone if they are no longer attracted to them after a major physical or aesthetic change. I am attracted to men, and to say that I am problematic because I wouldn't want to continue dating someone if they came out as a woman is frankly homophobic. People are allowed to no longer be attracted to people when they massively change themselves.
Yeah that's not cool, personally, I could care less how a partner identifies, I care that they're a good person and I care more about their personality than their appearance. At the end of the day if they can work with my issues (like you cannot under any circumstances touch my shoulders or from behind, because my brain might pick that time to have an anxiety/panic attack \[not sure which\]). If someone is willing to sign up for a potentially sexless relationship or one with very limited physical aspects, and has the right personality, I'm interested.
I'm currently crushing over someone who is trans(female to male), They are a close friend of mine and while I do admit they are really attractive I love them more because of who they are as a person. They helped me fit in more when I moved to school I'm currently attending and also helped me when I was going through a suicidal depression and was always there to talk to when I needed it. I love this person because they mean a lot to me and I love who they are as a person it dosent matter to me if they identify as a male or even beyond that such as religious belief because stuff like that shouldn't come in between you and the person you love and if you feel like it does then personally I do not think that is love. If you wish to be trans go ahead be you and if you think you have feelings towards a trans person don't  be shy and explore that feeling more by hanging out with that person more and talking with them to see if you really so enjoy them as a person. Love is love folks.
I think some meat suits are preferable to other meat suits. I don't think disgust is the right reaction but I'm not going to blame someone if they're not gay.
I am too very convinced that everyone is at least a bit bi but at the same time I heard that that's a bi thing to say (in a webtoon so it's not a very trustworthy source and I haven't double checked yet)
I 100% agree with you. WE are not in the least deceptive, nor are we Crazy. We are normal, with brains that formed our thoughts differently from our body
I kinda understand why straight people would leave their partner if they came out as trans though, they just don’t want to be with the same gender
I also hate how people don’t understand the concept of AGAB. I hate hearing comment like “X is a boy but wants to be a girl” like no you frigging idiot, X is a girl but was born a boy. It’s so simple
If I liked a person and I mean 100% fell in love with this person and they were trans I wouldn't care, its the person inside than what you see on the physical outside
I was listening to the Cheers title sequence music, and the lyrics go:

>Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead     
The morning's looking bright     
And your shrink ran off to Europe     
And didn't even write     
And your husband wants to be a girl     

So it’s, shitty thing, ok thing, shitty thing, shitty thing, a person being trans.

I’m tired.
I mean i would say that if a partner leaves/breaks up because of their own sexuality doesn't aline with your gender that is fair, but i do find it fucking sad when those people say they can't love one any more because in my mind that is bullshit
It's worse when non trans actors are playing the part of a trans character

I know acting used to have no gender roles and males played females and vice versa but this isn't the old days when the acting pool was limited

The most notable examples I have of this is movie ""The Crying Game"" with Jaye Davidson and the TV show ""Wentworth"" with Socratis Otto
You are like sooooooooo RIGHT‼️‼️‼️
My best friend told me if I where gay or trans she would kill herself. I eventually had to stop seeing her all together because i couldn’t stand that thought of her finding out. I hate that i believed that I was crazy and broken. I hate the idea that I believed I was a lier more.
Sadly, most “love” is extremely conditional. It’s human nature to be fickle and strongly reject anything that isn’t the “norm” in a society. 

When I finally accepted this, I finally felt good about just being in my own company and not interacting with other humans.
Devils advocate here, when I decides to come out I became a completely different person, I could definitely see how someone would want to leave me if I was in a relationship with them at that point, they would have been in love with someone else, not me, and thats no one's fault, it's just reality, maybe not for everyone though.
leaving this here: genital preferences are transphobic.
yeah, i really struggle listening to those same trans jokes in a lot of popular tv - friends in particular - because i’d only ever watch those kinds of shows with my family, who tend to think i don’t have a sense of humor
I agree with you completely. I'm sorry everyone is attacking you for your opinions instead of just sharing theirs. Downvote me all u want, but some of u sound transphobic.
I don't think it was done on purpose, and don't mean any ill will. I'm looking out for our transmasc peoples, and want to be clear.

Saying ""trans people,"" when the context suggests ""trans women/transfemmes,"" kinda excludes trans men/transmascs.

It's kinda hurtful to imply that trans women represent the trans community as a whole.

However, I do get what you mean. Trans women's depiction in the media's gross and disgusting. And it makes me sick. It shouldn't be portrayed like that.

Just wanted to make sure that, in a general trans sub, everyone's not excluded her.
If it’s just a meat suit then why do ours need to be changed
Ok but I think if you're attracted to mean, and your partner came out as a trans women, you should have every right to leave them because they just aren't your preffered gender anymore; not because you're distgusted by them or something tho, transphobic shit
This is such An original and talented post
I couldn't find the episode but that sucks man.
Not to mention the fetishes people have about us, if they do want to do a trans man/woman, it's probably just because they have a fetish about trans persons
From an outsiders perspective (I’m cis woman who originally had fear based TERF feelings, trying to educate myself on trans issues) 
I’m working on my attitude, knowledge and empathy. However, I would really struggle if my husband came out as trans. It’s part of the trans story that I struggle to challenge my views on, why should spouses/partners easily accept that the person they love is changing their gender?  Not only having to deal with the social stigma attached but also perhaps push aside their own innate  sexuality, or visions of what they had for a future? 
I’m not in anyway saying that trans people shouldn’t live their authentic life, but should a shocked and heartbroken spouse really have to sacrifice their own happiness? 
I’m aware this won’t be a popular view here, I’m open to hearing the trans POV and trying to learn
Transgender existence is just like communism.

Its goals are good and wholesome at heart, the people are amazong and just want a better future, but everybody esle sees it as something bad and constantly fails to even describe what it means...
i dont think trans people are deceptive, but if your dating someone and theyre just not into it, then they can leave peacefully
[deleted]
Oh absolutely it's so fucking gross on so many levels.
It comes from the idea that we exist for others
If anything I was being deceptive when I was closeted, and even then it wasn't being deceptive to hurt people, it's being deceptive because you don't know how they'll take it
Yeah it’s actually quite literally the opposite of deceptive. You’re trying to expose who you truly are to the world. Like WHATS NOT CLICKING STEVEN lol
This is what happened to me. I transitioned to female and she's not into girls. We're still friends, just incompatible based on her preferences and that's fine. It was sad but what can you do
similarly, say a woman in a relationship with a wonderful man who she loves and cares for (perhaps they’re even married and have had kids together) discovers and accepts she is lesbian and is not romantically or sexually attracted to her partner.

should they stay together because the man’s romantic and sexual attraction to her remain? do they lead a sexless relationship where neither person’s needs are are being fully met? do they continue to be intimate even though the woman grows more and more uncomfortable with it each time now knowing why it never quite felt right?
I can understand and agree with your statement. I am trans MTF started transitioning 2016 of March & my Wifeyyy is still with me we’ve been together for 14yrs but the difference is she’s Demi-Pansexual. I can highly understand that some individuals can except you for you. But; won’t date you or being in a romantic relationship with you & there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s called a preference for a reason. Also I do hate how some programs statements imply people of the trans & non-binary community are treated as insane or some kind of an abomination. Though never seen the show so I can’t answer my opinion on it but I can answer my logical on the subject there of.
Just to piggyback on this comment, but many people stay with their partner regardless of the gender their partner transitions to. My wife is cishet yet in a lesbian relationship with me. That doesn't change her orientation. I've seen the same with a lesbian couple (one partner transitions to male) and vice versa with a gay couple. A partners orientation may not dictate a relationship ending. Just want to put this out there because it's a common issue with older, married partners of trans people.
I like men but if my fiance began on a journey to be a woman I would still love them. It's the person I love not the body. Sure I love dick but there are strap-ons n stuff
Iirc, last time people were polled a few years ago, at least half of them stated they'd never met a trans person in real life before (to their knowledge, of course, most of us don't go around announcing it). I'd have to dig up the actual statistic, but if that's true it makes sense why people have such wild ideas about trans people and are so confident about them. They only know about trans people from media, and media often gets it wrong.

That's partly why representation is so important.
100% yes. Trans people are only like, 5% of the population (at least in my country, Australia) so most people don't know a trans person, meaning they lack both a reference and reason to research it. So majority of their views and thoughts on trans people would come from media, Tv, news etc. Pornography is especially terrible for it, still referring to trans people as ""tr**ny"" and leaning in on the deception angle.

It's frankly disgusting, and I say that with the most possible disdain
Sad that the movie chose to portray Bill that way when in the original text it's very clear he is a phycopath who is claiming minorities identity's to try and ""justify"" his actions. In the book it's very clear that Bill is a disturbed man who pretends to be trans and gay. In the movie they loose this thread altogether and it really set back the movement, the author has expressed remorse that Bill has become a symbol of hatred of/to trans people.
I can't tell if you're sarcastic or not.

maybe I'm wrong but trans-accepting movies and stuff (*especially* sitcoms) weren't even a thing back then.
I'm so sorry that the person you loved and trusted most let you down
Thats what I ran into, but we are not ex, nor have I progressed. We had been married 5 years (now 30) after dating 3. I couldn't have told her earlier because I didn't know myself. There was no way to learn about this pre- internet. Other than the occasional news piece or TV show, there was no discussion. No info about what I was going through. The term transgendered wasn't widely known until the 90s, when I told her. Yet I was still deceptive.
understandable that she got a bit upset, especially if she isn’t attracted to the gender you transitioned/are transitioning to, but the way she went about letting you know is completely wrong. i’m so sorry you have to go through something like this.
well i guess the thought process might’ve been “jake knows he’s a guy and doesn’t want to be female, but says he’s a girl because he’s insane” doesn make much sense to me but i guess it’s the best possible explanation for what he said
exactly, it’s completely OK to be/not be attracted to certain genitals! if someone doesn’t like the male genital, then they shouldn’t have to put up with it in a relationship they’re not happy with, just like it’s ok to not want to date a woman with male genitals. i might get downvoted for this, but i want people to see my opinion on it all. (keyword: opinion)
Right?!
I am in a similar boat as you, and having that support behind me to be true to myself is the greatest thing I could have ever asked for. Regardless of what happens in the future, I know we are going to be strong together. We both know it’s not about sexuality, but about the emotional and mental connection.
I am a bi who thought everyone would be bi if they felt comfortable enough socially. My understanding is some people are actually completely straight lol it was a bit of a shock to me.
[removed]
Exactly, this is what I mean, but apparently we are the minority thinking that
I don't think that's true at all. I think most people have genital preferences. I'm just confused about how if someone loves someone and their body changes how they suddenly stop loving them
I'm a trans guy, I ment all trans people, this was just one example of how are community is portrayed.....
That's a personal thing. Not every trans person does change their body . But if it brings someone happiness then I think it's worth it . I just personally dont think someone's body is the most important thing about them. I wish more people saw us as who we are despite our bodies. Maybe if people say me as a man despite.y body I wouldn't feel I needed to change it
Apparently most agree and I am the minority
I think it stems from the idea that we are not real men and women, Women/Men Lite if you will
Exactly. This is why I’m a hyper-individualist.
Deceptive not to hurt others but so we aren't hurt by the ones who say we decieve them
I assume if this fear of being perceived as gay for the smallest, arbitrary things wasn't this rampant it might be better. 

**NOT** because transwomen are men or some bullshit like this, but they once were perceived as men, presented male. So for men who are horrified of the big *GAY*...

Then comes the misunderstanding that transwomen ever were men. If you get Wasabi in your toothpaste tube, you wouldn't stand your ground on it being toothpaste, now, would you?

Edit: autocorrect did me dirty
Same for me:(
I’m super happy y’all stayed together, but it either changes her orientation a little or invalidates your gender. Maybe she’s bi or pan, or something else entirely, but if you’re both female, that’s not a straight relationship. It’s not that important and I wouldn’t fight over it, especially if you’re happy, but y’all fall somewhere under the queer umbrella.
>My wife is cishet yet in a lesbian relationship with me.

Wierd way to say your wife is bisexual
It's cool that you would, but don't judge people that wouldn't. Same way we have no say in how we feel about our gender, one's sexuality is not something that can be controlled.
This idea that it's bad to not longer be sexually attracted to your partner if they transition is... Bad. To say the least.

There's an implication there that sexuality can be chosen and changed and it's simply not true. It's a dangerous concept to perpetuate.

Is it bad to say ""I don't like my partner anymore because they're trans""? Of course. But is it bad to say ""I'm no longer attracted to my partner because I'm gay/straight and they transitioned into a gender presentation I am not attracted to""? No, it isn't.

You can still love and care for someone and not want to be in a relationship with them.
Would I still love my partner if they transitioned? Yes, of course, I love them for who they are. 
Would I still be sexually attracted to them? No I wouldn’t because I’ve never seen men in that light. 
I think it’s great that you can be sexually attracted regardless of presentation but not everyone can do that because you can’t choose who you’re attracted to either.
attraction (of any type) is not a choice. just because your attraction is gender-agnostic doesn’t mean you get to look down on others who’s is not.
Listen OP, I know where you're coming from, and I can relate and personally resonate with what you said. But that doesn't meam everybody else has to be that way :( There are so many people who see sex a different way and that's just fine tho! They have a preference flat out. If that preference is removed it can remove a massive element of the relationship that prevtiously was in harmony and agreement. While a change in gender identity is FAR from a deal breaker for me and I gather you too, that doesn't by any means obligate our partner in question to feel the same way, even, much less an average Joe on Reddit. I know what you're saying and that's why I understand you but most people aren't going to agree with that.
The one that stands out was Gimme a Break, when cheifs old college roommate shows up, and he's so excited, and she is a SHE. A very beautiful woman, with a career and happy. And shes tolerant of Cheif who is weirded out by it. It's part of how I came to be me. I identified with her character. And was impressed by how she handled the situation. Same with The Crying Game.
Twin Peaks, season 2, aired in 1991 and featured a trans character (wonderfully portrayed by David Duchovny). It wasn't done perfectly, and there is even an intentional misgendering that goes unrebuked, but it says a lot that there was only one misgendering and that in general, the character was accepted by everyone else without question. 25 years later, the character that plays her boss said that when she came out, he told her co-workers to ""fix their hearts or die.""

Now, none of this was done perfectly, but it was all done with good intentions, and it was done better than anything in popular media before it. That deserves recognition.
How do you figure 60s and 70s was HUGEEE for LGBT+ Between stonewall, protesting peacefully for gay/trans/all rights and that leaked into media too, It wasn’t until ronald regan AKA the red scare that “Scared” people away from fighting for rights or representation in culture, The dick Cavett show, Dallas, The jefferson show. So if anything where just going back in time in a sense sadly😓
Thank you.  She went far beyond that.  She outed me to a bunch of people and had numerous affairs.  I did not believe she was capable of the things she did and has done.  It’s a sordid story and not worth telling.
I just hid it from myself and tried to take it to my grave.  Crippling depression after age 40 forced me to examine myself.  It was hard as hell to look at myself in the mirror, at age 43, and say out loud “I am trans.”
I’m sorry.   I hope that You can find a measure of peace and happiness in your heart.  I know it’s so hard when you’re on the knife’s edge of family and gender identity like that.
OK after that there is the princess cookie episode
[removed]
Look if we bleed the same color than there's no point in discriminating eachother, unless your a shitty person
you’re trans, imagine someone falls deeply in love with you, and wants to start a sexual relationship, only to find you haven’t had bottom surgery yet. this is the only thing holding them back. sure, people *have* preferences, but if your preference is contingent on matching the genitals to the gender presentation, that’s transphobia. if you can’t handle trans body parts, don’t date trans people (which, you guessed it, also transphobia!)
Oh, my bad! I didn't mean didn't mean anything bad, just saw the words and jumped on. That's my bad and I'm sorry.
Exactly
My situation right now, I have a straight boyfriend 😔
Maybe demisexual towards women and allosexual towards men? ^^
So definitely not trying to be argumentative (sorry if it comes across that way). She is straight. If not for me, she'd only date men. Her continuing to be in a relationship with me even though it defies her sexual orientation doesn't change her orientation. A partner changing gender doesn't automatically change their partners orientation. And implying it does invalidates her orientation. This doesn't just apply to straight relationships but also to gay ones.

This is a big topic among married couples and often a huge point of stress for the cis partner. You'll find that many partners would make the same statement, if not for you I'd be... But we were married for 7 years and together for 14 years when I came out. She made the decision to try to stay together and it took years of therapy to assauge her own issues and fears and also to help her continue to feel secure in her own sexuality despite my transition. It wasn't an easy process for her to see past my gender and past my outside to realize I was the same person. So it's really hurtful to people like her to be called not their orientation after they work so hard to reconcile that with themselves.

I'd feel more validated if she Id'ed as pan or something, but we've had that talk and it's just not who she is. And she doesn't feel the need to label herself just because of me. 

Check out r/mypartneristtans and you'll see this same conversation had frequently.

Why do people need to be sexually attracted to someone to be in a relationship?
I'm only attracted to men. But I wouldn't stop loving someone because their body changed
huh. well that's new.

can you send me links about the episodes in question? i'm genuinely curious now.
Oh I forgot all about that character! It was silly as all Dave lynch characters are, but done in a way where it was like, yeah she's trans, whatever.
Yeah. For that Gimme a Break episode to air (i think who's the boss also had a similar episode) during the Reagn Regime was kind of impressive. No minstrel show mockery,  and done as well as can be by Cis people in the 80s.
So sorry things went that way. Are you away from them now, and safe from being outted and put in bad situations?
Uh, I am trans myself and believe that you should be alowed to not date or be attracted to people because of there genitals because, get this, people can't choose what or who they are attracted to.
i think this comes down to one thing a lot of trans people overlook. If your going to come out to someone you have to do it before going into a sexual relationship. Its unfair on the other person because genital preferences do exist. dont be quick to call someone transphobic because it backfires on you
Genitalia preference is not transphobic. Honestly sounds more like an excuse to pressure someone who’s not attracted to the specific sex organs into sex…
Thanks for lookin out
Stay strong💪💪
Nope. She's with you and you're a woman.  That's like saying ""my husband is straight but he's married to me and I'm a man"". Unless that is your wife doesn't see you as a woman which I hope isn't the case.
Some people don't, but some people do. Everyone is different, and what works for some might not work for others. 

I wanted to say that as a bi/pan person, I understand completely where you are coming from. If I had a partner who transitioned, I would still love and be attracted to them, but that doesn't mean that it's hateful to be gay/lesbian/straight, it's just how attraction works.

When you position one gender/sexual orientation as 'morally correct', then it's a slippery slope to becoming a bigot. Please don't slide down that ladder! Everyone is different, and that is an awesome thing about humanity, not a bad thing.
Well i think your reducing the reason someone would leave as only sexually. Im a gay trans man who's ambivalent and open sexuality wise to women not romantically at all. So if my partner turned out to be a woman i wouldn't feel the same romantic love anymore. I'd probably still feel live for them in a different way since we would have been together but not romantically anymore.
Because that's how how some people are. Everyone has different needs in a relationship.
I guess you thought you got me there, but I'm literally asexual so not really the gotcha you thought it'd be. 

Sexual attraction matters to a majority of people. Not to everybody, but to most. And that is all that matters, people are allowed to break a relationship if something doesn't work out for them - a lot of people enjoy and need sex and wish to be in a relationship where those needs can be met. Not everyone is bi, pan or polyam, so not everyone will be able to adapt to a relationship where their partner transitions. And that's okay. It is only an issue when the transness itself is the problem, not when sexual attraction is.
Because sex and sexual attraction is important to a lot of people. Im sex repulsed (not asexual, just sex repulsed) but would rather someone break up with me if they aren’t attracted to men than stay with me because as I transition and resemble more of a man, their attraction is likely to fade because sexuality and romantic orientation are not always fluid. Sure, in some cases it can be. But not always. Someone not attracted to men dating me would make me so dysphoric because I am a man, they shouldn’t feel attracted to me.
Have you considered that romantic attraction and sexual attraction can be divergent? One can be homoromantic and asexual, or heteroromantic and pansexual, for example. For most people, romantic attraction and sexual attraction align and are roughly equally important, but that's not always the case.
we mayyy be on the same page, i agree that someone’s love for another has no reason to cease altogether just because the other person transitions or comes out.

the point i’m trying to clarify is that it is fair and acceptable for an intimate relationship to end or change to a platonic friendship if their romantic/sexual attractions no longer align

edit: u:/tippingpoint30 pointed out something i hadn’t considered (foolishly as i have myself just recently learned this) there are many forms of attraction and while some are often intertwined the can all occur independently.
The Crying Game was a movie about the IRA.  That's really about all I can say without MAJOR spoilers. But yeah, major trigger warning. The TV episode was on a show called Gimme A Break, with Nell Carter and Joey Lawrence in his first role. https://m.imdb.com › title
""Gimme a Break!"" Melissa (TV Episode 1983) - IMDb
Yeah, it's like Lynch could get away with treating a trans person like a normal person because Lynch is a weirdo, but him doing that helped to normalize it.
Yeah.  I live on my own (my 19 yr old daughter moved in with me).  
We have four children, two at home so I’m forced to deal with her, unfortunately.  
Thank you for asking.
its called gyno/androphilia.
? this sentiment just circles back to the “trans people are deceptive because they aren’t disclosing the genitals they have” argument.
Always! :)
Look, if you can't understand the nuance of my situation, that's on you. But don't gatekeep my wife's orientation. It's hers to define, it's her label to decide. If you feel you need more information before passing judgement on a stranger's wife's sexual orientation, see my other comment in reply to this. 

But you arguing about my wife's orientation is just sick.

Edit: also, I'm genderfluid, not just a woman.
Are you saying I'm not gay?
No I had no idea
More like gynosexual (bing attracted to femininity) or androsexual(being attracted to masculinity)
But don’t you see the irony? People don’t have a choice in the genitals they are attracted to, just like how a gay person doesn’t choose to be gay, which I’m sure you agree with.
If I'm getting to the point in a relationship where it could become sexual or I like someone enough to be in a long term relationship, I absolutely would disclose to them if what they expect from my body doesn't match what bottom parts I have
>Edit: also, I'm genderfluid, not just a woman

You never stated that before
EDIT: wanted to add if you're telling people you're in a ""lesbian"" relationship with your wife they're going to assume you're a woman
No? Im just saying sexual attraction is more fluid for some people than others, and that's fine!
You’re looking extra hard into this to make yourself feel better. It’s not that deep, if you’re attracted to your partner then dope
I think we are witnessing you discovering something about yourself, lol.

I know there are a lot of labels out there, but you don't have to put one on.

Technically attraction regardless of gender is some form of pansexual.
gyno- doesn’t indicate feminine. feminine indicates feminine. ive never heard of a single person who themselves transgyno or transandro instead of transfem/transmasc
then the genital attraction has to be separate from the dating preferences, which was the whole point of the original post. y’all are so irritating
now tell me, why would someone need to expect a certain set of genitals based on presentation? and, from that, what should people end up expecting from people who identify off the binary of man/woman?
Why? There are plenty of non-binary lesbians. This is why NB people have such a difficult time discussing things with binary trans people. Even if I was a binary trans woman, that doesn't change my wife's orientation.

Edit: it also says bigender right there in my tag.
I don't hav the right way to word this. I defined myself as gay , as a man who likes men. But apparently I'm the minority here saying I would stay with my partner if they were trans and had surgery to have a vagina. I'm not sexually attracted to women but I love someone for who they are inside and not their body. The same way I would continue to love my partner if they became paralyzed or something. If I love someone I love them no matter what. So is there some other name for this? I wouldn't seek a woman for a partner but if my partner became a woman I would still love and want to be with them eventhough I'm not sexually attracted to women's characteristics. So since my experience doesn't seem to align with other gay and straight people, is there some better description of my sexual (and romantic ,just found out this is also a separate characteristic) feelings?
I think you're right ! I thought I was just gay but Im finding apparently how I feel is not the norm maybe homosexual/panromantic or something like that
No, it's not used like that...Google it
once again, if you identify off the binary you would tell them as well. relationships are a two way streak after all.
Whatever I'm done with this.  You obviously only wish to argue and find fault in whatever I say. Wishing you the best. Namaste
If you want to put a name on your attraction there are options \^^

Either pansexual with focus on male partners or allosexual towards men and demisexual towards women? 

(in general gay but if you love a woman you can feel sexual attraction towards her)


In general I would say, don't think of those labels as defining what you are and how you feel. Think of them describing to the closest of your knowledge.

You as a person are valid in your attractions and feelings. You put on a label to help describe those things. Labels are a shorthand.
you google it lmao definitions of things evolve, thats how language works
why would a nonbinary person need to disclose genitals? all of this is just reenforcing heteronormative sentiments that cis people already push on us. trans people should be allowed to be with whomever they want to be with without worrying about being persecuted for their genitals, no? what about the countless trans women who have encountered violence because this exact point wasn’t disclosed? is it their fault because they didn’t tell the sexual prospect that they were trans and hadn’t had bottom surgery yet?

I hate the hate for pronouns that aren't he/him, she/her, or they/them	"I told a friend my pronouns and he said:

""Look, I can respect he/him, she/her, and they/them, but this is where I draw the line. Why can't you just use he/him or they/them instead?""

""I prefer zhe/zhim, it's more comfortable.""

""It's too hard for me. Can I just call you he?""

""Please dont""

""Ehhh I'm calling you he. At least I don't use she lol""

I hate it. I hate how I have to use he/him instead because people say this kind of shit to me when I tell them my actual pronouns. I hate how if it isn't he/him, she/her, they/them, people, even queer people, will refuse to respect my pronouns.

I used to go by she/him, no one respected it. I asked them to use both but they only used she/her for me.

""yOu UsE sHe/HeR tOo WhY aRe YoU sO aNgRy??""

People told me to just use one. I couldn't decide between the 2 of them so I decided to just use it/its. My sister told me:

""Why?? Isn't it dehumanizing? Why can't you just use they/them?""

""I mean, yeah, it can be. Some people don't like it because it feels dehumanizing and it's not their pronouns. Don't use it/its for people who don't use those pronouns, but please use it for me! I like it, it's cool and I'm more comfortable with it/its than they/them.""

""I don't like using it for you. I feel like a bad person. I'll just use he/him.""

""Using it/its for me won't make you a bad person, you're just respecting my pronouns. Not using it/its is what will make you a bad person.""

""I still don't like it. I'm just going to use he/him for you.""

No one respected it. They told me it's weird and that they feel bad when using them. I was forced to use he/him instead.

I found out I was under the genderfluid umbrella and decided to change my pronouns depending on what gender I felt like. No one respected it and just used whatever pronouns they wanted to use for me.

""Wait, don't use he/him pronouns for me, I feel more she/they rn.""

""Ehh I feel like calling you he/him. Dw it's fine you also use he/him pronouns.""

No one respected my pronouns. I was too confusing. They told me to just stick with one pronoun instead. 

I decided to use zhe/zhim. People tell me it's too hard to use and that they don't know how to use it. I tell them how to use my pronouns but they still don't use them. They decided to just use he or she for me instead.

I hate how people tell me to just use they/them or he/him. I hate how people tell me neopronouns are weird. I hate seeing people (even queer people) debate about the validity of my pronouns. MY PRONOUNS ARE VALID PLEASE RESPECT THEM

I dont like using he/him because I'm under the genderfluid umbrella so sometimes I don't feel masculine. I don't like using she/her because I don't always feel feminine. I don't like using they/them because I just don't like with it. It doesn't feel like it's the right one for me.

Zhe/zhim is just so much better. It works when im fem, masc, and nonbinary. Unlike they/them, this one feels right to me. It's better than it/its because it has the letter z and z is my favourite letter. I wish people actually used it for me tho. They say it's ""too confusing"" and ""too hard to use."" Only one person uses it. Everyone else just uses she/her or he/him.

WHY CANT PEOPLE JUST RESPECT MY PRONOUNS ITS NOT LIKE IM USING SLURS FOR PRONOUNS WHY IS IT SO HARD?? STOP MISGENDERING ME STOP SAYING IM A MAN/WOMAN STOP MAKING ME BINARY. STOP SAYING IM A GIRL BECAUSE IM AFAB, STOP SAYING IM A BOY BECAUSE IM TRANS. STOP USING THEY/THEM FOR ME BECAUSE IM NONBINARY. JUST STOP,  PLEASE STOP.




Edit: Wow, thank you for all the neopronoun hate!! It is greatly appreciated, I'm so happy I got the hate I was complaining about! This is super awesome!! /s

I can't believe this is happening. We're all trans people but you're acting like how cis transphobes treat us. Just because you personally don't understand it doesn't mean it's not valid. Stop debating over whether I'm valid or not. I can't believe this is happening in a trans community, it makes me so sad.

Thanks to everyone who respects neopronouns tho!! It makes me really happy!! And thanks to everyone who doesn't understand but tries!! You're awesome! Here have a cookie 🍪"	"I don't get the hate around neopronouns/it/its pronouns either, like here's my approach to these things

Does XYZ affect other people?

If no respect XYZ

Like, it's not that hard
I find it difficult to handle neopronouns and to use them consistently. But i do really try. (Really helps if someone has a pronoun badge.)
I think a lot of people like the *idea* of being progressive but don’t think about the core ideas (e.g. empathy, universal tolerance, nonjudgemental curiosity, etc). Like, they’ll more-or-less follow the rules “don’t be racist, homophobic, sexist, transphobic, etc” but when something falls outside the rules they’ve learned, they stop practicing empathy and all that. They’ll make fun of people for being fat, or bald, or using neopronouns, having disabilities, etc as long as they still can claim they’re “following the rules” of progressivism

(Edit: I know baldness is a weird example, I don’t mean to equate it to the neopronoun thing at all. I included it because it’s a thing people think doesn’t matter, but as an older trans-femme it is extremely relevant to dysphoria. Hell, even cis people experience dysphoria from it. Again, not equating, just an example of a thing people are ok making fun of despite supposedly being progressive.)
I find the neopronouns a little strange but I would never do anything like that, if that’s what they want to be referred to as then that’s what I’ll do
Hey OP, what do you use as a possessive pronoun? 

(Or anyone else if zhe has answered this already & I just haven’t seen it!)
I can’t say I understand the appeal of neo pronouns myself, but if someone told me that they used neo pronouns I’d do my best to respect them, whatever those pronouns were. Just because I don’t understand it doesn’t mean it’s okay for me to ignore and erase their identity - that would make me no better than a transphobe.
Problem with neopronouns is you need to have a group prepped to use it, otherwise people default to he/she or they if they are totally confused.  It is considered offensive and considered calling them an object rather than a person, xer and such are considered off the beaten trail.  That all said, it should be possible to have your local friend group and work be able to gender you correctly.  If they can't they are shit friends and shit work, gendering someone correctly is the simplest thing you can do, we aren't asking for you to help move all the shit in our house or to help cut down a tree and move the debris, it fucking changing some words>.>

That said, misgendering might pop up from time to time as society is defaulted to he/she more or less.  We live in a very binary society and people default to it, even people you know as brain might take over and say 'oh yea looks like boy call them he'.  

Like I said, you need a better group of people but not sure what else to say.
My big issue with neopronouns is internal, I will beat myself up for forgetting them and that self anger (I’ve been told by a friend) can come across as resentment towards xem. We’re still friends and xe/xem/xyrs is becoming *less* of a mind fuck for me, but it’s like learning singular they, with even more of a curve. 

I’m sorry that people use the difficulty as an excuse not to use your pronouns thoughtfully, that’s really shitty.
Hey im sorry folks are disrespecting you like this. I think neopronouns are cool. It seems like one of those things that will become more normal with time. Like how they/them and being nonbinary was just ""too far"" not that long ago. A lot nore people are growing to accept nonbinary folk and hopefully soon theyll learn to accept people who use neopronouns.
Yikes, OP needs some serious support IRL. Zhe asked for so little but zhe got “ehhh I’ll just do this thing you hate” instead. Can’t people just listen to zhim? Not that hard.
It really urks me when people refuse to even try to get your pronouns right because its “too hard” like, yes using neopronouns in a sentence for the first time is hard, but just?? try?? 
im sorry people have been treating you this way, you rlly deserve better friends :(
Do I get neopronouns? It’s something I have a hard time getting sometimes admittedly. 


Do I respect them and the people that use them? Yes. English is a constantly evolving language and this is a part of that process.
In my language there's no ""they/them"". There's not even an ""it"", even objects have genders. It's absurd!! And, as someone who uses the pronoun that is considered as the translation of ""they/them""... I just want to say that i understand your pain. I'm sorry you have to go through this, but you're not alone in your fight. And I will respect your pronouns and anyone's too. It's a promise :)
“I don’t like neopronouns” “I find them strange” “I don’t understand…” 
You are legit in a trans forum. 
I PERSONALLY cannot understand why people who understand transitioning and the challenges that come with them would bash someone else for pronouns. Most of us struggle here and really love when people use the right pronouns so please respect OP.
I've never met anyone with neopronouns, but I would try my hardest. I don't use neopronouns, but sometimes I feel more neutral and flexible with them (as long as it's not she/her), so I wouldn't mind if someone used they/them or even neopronouns for me. 

It's kind of ironic that I see this post when I literally just got into an irl argument defending neopronouns. My friend, one of her friends I'd just met, and my sister starting talking about their LGBTIA identities when the girl I had just met suddenly exclaimed, ""Not to be rude, I support everyone, but if you use neopronouns don't fucking talk to me"".

The other girls including my sister agreed, going on about how _**they feel**_ like it's making a mockery of trans people who use she/her, he/him, or they/them pronouns. None of them asked for my opinion on it so I just watched them talk and didn't say a word because I suddenly felt like I was no longer in safe space.

This is such an issue with cis people and it's not funny at all. STOP TALKING OVER TRANS PEOPLE. If your cisgender ass and your cisgender friends are having a conversation about trans people and the ONLY trans person in the room is completely silent, THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.
I understand the neopronouns like ze, xe, ey, it (though using it I personally struggle cuz it feels like im dehumanizing people) and stuff like that but I cannot wrap my head around nounself ones, if someone could explain thatd be awesome
I feel like whatever makes people happy and comfortable go for it! It's no skin off your nose to call someone what they like to be called
Who gives a shit just use what someone wants to use. I think it's neat the kids are coming up with new pronouns
Trans is beautiful. We, each and every one of us recreate gender and our very selves in the image of our soul. People like OP take it a step further (a step ""queerer,"" if you will, not that queerness can be calculated). Zhey recreate in zheir own image not only zhemselves and the so-called fundamental aspect of humanity that is gender, but also language itself.

Neopronouns are beautifully queer
Is it ok for me to ask how these pronouns are pronounced? That would be the only problem I’d have with them, is if you texted them to me and I wouldn’t know how to pronounce them. But once you told me how they are pronounced, I would say those pronouns. Everyone deserves to use the pronouns that they’re most comfortable with. I’m a trans man, and I know what it’s like when people don’t call you the right thing. I’d never, in a billion years, tell you that you can’t use those words. It’s beyond comprehension, to me. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Hope you can surround yourself with people who will be respectful
I think non-traditional / neopronouns are neat.

I don't use them for myself, despite being genderqueer / genderfluid / confusing pile of gender whatever. I'm too old. Too old for the cool new pronouns. 

Besides, the people in my personal life won't even use they/them for me. So why bother trying to find something else I like better?

I don't see what the big deal is though. Adopting new pronouns isn't all that different from adopting a new nickname. And it makes the people who use them happy when you say them.
I fucking despise pronoun discourse like this because at the end of the day, the people in power who hate all trans people don't hate all trans people because some of us use neopronouns.

Throwing that cat/catself person under the boot won't save your face from being stomped on.
I hate the whole “oh neos are bad cause confusing/new/weird” rubbish. They are what the person chose to represent them, and anything else is just blatantly ignorant. Neos are real, they are used, and sure, you don’t have to exactly understand them, but that isn’t an excuse to ignore them and people who use them, because just like how only you get to define what your gender is, only you get to choose what your pronouns are, and being assholes to people who use Neos only hurts the community as a whole.
I use it/its and he/him, once I mentioned my friend how I really liked it/its pronouns in comparison to he/him and he was like ""Alright I'll use that one more then"" and I smiled so hard.

I mostly use he/him for other people's comfort but I also don't mind them, prefer it/it's tho they make me feel good about myself. 10/10 Would recommend using people's preferred pronouns you could be making their day.
Neopronouns can be hard to learn to use but I practice forming sentences that might get said a lot. It requires practice but so does learning how to pronounce someone's name sometimes. It's just basic respect to learn how to use someone's pronouns.

I use ze/zim! Also they/them but my friends know I also have neopronouns.

No one should misgender you just because they don't care enough to learn your pronouns. That's just transphobia. People use it/its all the time for babies and small children (""is it a boy or a girl?"") despite knowing children are human, so someone picking it/its pronouns should be fine.
I don’t understand why ppl can’t just respect pronouns. Like even if your uncomfortable with any sort of pronouns, YOU SHOULD STILL USE THEM. Like I’m uncomfortable with christians does that mean I’m gonna go around disrespecting them? NO. I still will respect, listen and validate them no matter my feelings. I am so sorry you had to go through all this crap. And to all the queer ppl also disrespecting zhim, you are literally treating ppl the way you hate to be treated.
i’m perfectly fine with neopronouns, my only thing is i don’t know how to pronounce some of them if i only read them and don’t hear them out loud. that’s just me being kinda stupid though. i feel bad about all the hate neopronouns get, it really isn’t deserved. like anything, it’s something people have to adjust and get used to, but people are never *going* to adjust if they just dismiss it immediately and don’t even try. at the end of the day, it’s none of your (the royal you) business why people identify the way they do and their relationship to gender, all you have to do is respect it. 

the amount of neopronoun hate in the lgbtq community, including on this post where OP is *literally complaining about neopronoun hate* is uncalled for, feeding into harmful stereotypes, and echoing cishet logic of “wElL tHaTs NoT rEaL, iM nOt GoNnA uSe ThOsE pRoNoUnS oR tHaT nAmE.” smh guys, you lot should know better.

Did zhe not say clears? Respect. Zhis. Pronouns. We know some of you don't like neopronouns, you keep saying that. Do it for zhim. Zhe has endured enough bullshit, it's time to give zhim some love.

Sorry to be so blunt, but this was needed.
Ugh I hate that shit so much. If I tell you my pronouns then those are my pronouns. If I say she/her don’t fuckin use they/them. That’s like me callin a very much cis guy by she/her. My “friend” Robbie is so bad about this. I literally don’t think he’s ever used my correct pronouns and always just days she/her and because he has a short fuse to say the least he gets pissed at me for correcting him. At this point if he doesn’t stop I’m gonna start callin him by she/her till he either gets the hint or one of us tells the other to piss off
I wish I could use my neopronouns more and hate the fact my native language doesn't have them :( I am sorry you get misgendered I know that feeling and I hate it too
Some neo pronouns are pretty common where i live, so i (try) to understand the struggle, im sorry you have to deal with bigotry like that
ITS YOUR IDENTITY, not there’s, not zhim’s, not xe’s, and definitely not fucking hers, it’s WHAT YOU decide for you, no one can take that away from you. I am in similar boat, my partner accosted me the last year just to try and get a “him” out of him… 
You Are Valid to me <3 
This community comes up with some weird fucking names to call themselves, youd think they’d be able to  handle something a little outside of the box 🫠 

I FEEL for this.  Message me anytime to rant about the so called queer community <3
I use she/her mainly but I have others I'm too scared to tell people about... so I understand
I don't understand the point of neopronouns at all
For me it’s twofold, often they involve syllables that to my knowledge don’t even exist in my language. I can’t easily pronounce them, at that point it’s easier for me to just avoid interacting with that person. if it’s online then it’s more that it’s using terms that people aren’t familiar with and it doesn’t come naturally without stopping and pausing. Not to start on ones involving regular nouns which I’ve met people that use and I just cannot work with, sentences break down before I can get them out of my mouth and are near impossible to read on screen/paper.
People get mad when you use they them as a pronoun and get mad when you don’t.
[removed]
Neo pronouns are hard for me, but I think that is only because I don’t know anyone who uses them. I view it the same way that I view any other preferred pronouns. I feel awful whenever I have to use he/him over she/her, and I assume the same is true for you. You found the words that make you feel the most valid and excepted, and anyone who doesn’t respect that is just being an ass.
I can understand ppl struggling to use them since it's newer and forgetting but if they don't even try they don't respect you.
[removed]
I’m so sorry people are being assholes in the comments, your pronouns are valid and you should get to decide how everyone addresses you, no one else. Using neopronouns like zhe/zhim is no different than using something like they/them they’re all just words and it’s frustrating to see people even in this community be assholes about it. All the best to you OP
i thought you were dissing on neos for a second and i got rlly scared lol, i hope u find some people that respect ur pronouns :((
Thank you for being vulnerable about this, I used to think neopronouns were silly but posts like this indicate they really matter to some folks

Also zhe/zhim is fun to say so people are missing out :)
Yeah they/them pronouns don’t fit me either. The thing is no one could argue my pronouns confuse them because my pronouns are literally he/him but my family use they/them or she/her pronouns anyway because I’m AFAB and they think I’m non-binary or just not valid even though I have specified many times that I’m a boy and they should just treat and refer to me like any other boy. I don’t know anyone with neopronouns and I don’t really know what they mean but I still think they should be validated and respected.
I’m sorry people in your life and people in these comments are mean to you. You deserve to be called whatever pronoun YOU feel comfortable with and you deserve people who make you feel included by using your correct pronouns.
Its really not that hard to just respect someone’s decision even if you don’t understand it. People do it all the time but when it comes to pronouns, all of a sudden it’s the hardest thing in the world. And the worst part is those in the queer or leftist communities who wont use neopronouns. Like how does that logic work
It's petty and bitchy, but just start referring to them by the wrong pronouns on purpose. Give them a taste of what it feels like
sorry for these comments :( i think ur pronouns r cool
I agree! I hate when people don’t respect neopronouns it doesn’t hurt you to use the pronouns but it does hurt the person your misgendering!
Out of curiosity, how would one pronounce those pronouns? Might steal em myself lol
All i ask is if you have Neopronouns, you please tell me how to use them grammatically.

For you, Zhe/Zhim would be easy, as it is literally just a Z in front of He/Him (Z in front of him, Replace S in she with Z? Idk doesn't matter)

Idk I'll always respect Neopronouns if you give me the means to be able to.
i hope you can find people irl who’ll respect you. pronoun choice is not for the comfort of others. misgendering like this is not okay.
Why can't we as a community realize that obviously the neo pronouns are not as comfortable for people to use. Yes it sucks! They/them has been around a lot longer and outlasted so many others because of it's ease to use in the English language. If you want to go by an odd pronoun you'll have to practice some mindfulness. It doesn't help to have expectations that people will find it easy to use. I will try my ass off to use the correct pronoun for people and it's frustrating to me when people dont even try, but you have to have some understanding around that as a human being. People aren't used to it. Find your inner peace. I know pronouns are a big deal, but they might not be as big as forming positive connections with our friends and bringing down the walls that separate us. I get your rant completely. I hope you find some peace.
TLDR: Be persistent and firm about your pronouns being used. They are YOURS.

You pick your pronouns that you feel the most comfortable with, honestly

Even if that means going back to something someone else said no to

If that one makes you feel the most at home in your skin, that is yours.

YOUR pronouns are not to be dictated by anyone else.

If they don't use the pronouns that YOU said to use to refer to YOU, then they shouldn't refer to you at all.

In fact, have the mindset that they have.

Your sister wouldn't think that someone means her if someone refers to her as a them or a he, bc she uses she/her/hers

If your pronouns are zhe/zhim/zheirs, then that is what you react to.

If someone refers to you without that, ask them who they mean. If they don't correct themselves, let them know ""that isn't how you refer to me."" and correct them. Tell them the proper way to refer to you.

If they continue not refering to you correctly, that's disrespectful. It's not hard. It doesn't hurt them whatsoever, they just do not *want* to.
dUDE? WHY ARE THEY?? TELLING YOU?? NOT TO WORRY?? THEYRE JUST MISGENDERING yOU??

like.

YO??

tf. 

i do have a question tho: is it pronounced “zay” or “zee” or “zeh”. i just wanna practice a lil.

edit: nvm, i read your reply to someone else :)
What’s the difference between they/them and zhe/zhim
I need an explanation of Neopronouns, I seriously need one before I accidentally upset people
I have a learning disability and ADHD, so if I can’t make connections that help me understand certain words, for example, it makes retaining and regurgitating information extremely difficult. I’ll always do my best to be respectful of all pronouns, but I have to ask people repeatedly to be patient with me because I’m genuinely struggling to keep track of how and when to use them with which people. I also have no idea how to pronounce them all and I’m in a constant state of panic that I’m going to offend someone.

A lot of us may seem ignorant or hateful, but we’re really doing our best trying to keep up and retain new information across a wide spectrum. We care, we just need some grace while we work on keeping up!
This is all reminding me of invader zim
Here, have a dose of euphoria. 

“Oh, Italic_Text is so nice. Zhey always help me!”
i'm so sorry, those people really suck. the casual misgendering here is on another level fr.

neopronouns can be pretty confusing, i gotta say - but i'm damn well gonna try my absolute bloody best to get them right.

zhe/zhim seems a fairly easy one to me, too - the pronunciation seems fairly straightforward.
yes! then you get to see how many binary trans people are transphobic and get pissed at you for using neopronouns because “neopronouns are dehumanizing”
I don't hate them but i don't understand them either. I feel like they/them fits very well for intersex, non-binary, 2-souls and pretty much everything that isn't he or she.
Jesus Christ. You know what I do in these situations? Call you by your name.

My two cents: I’ve never understood it, but I will still use it when referring to someone. Lack of understanding isn’t an excuse to be an asshole
Don't give them the space for disrespect. Hell, get passive aggressive and pick their pronouns for them too... If they get to disrespect your wishes that is an invitation to disrespect theirs. And if they get made point out how they are being hypocritical because, seriously, f- them. Not worth your time or effort, if they can't respect something as essential as your pronouns, they don't respect you.
The fact of the matter is we just don't have an agreed upon word for a lot of the spectrum, the problem isn't with how you identify it's that there's no agreed upon pronouns for certain places on the spectrum. It's not that it's invalid it's that we need words for it
This. I have two sets of neopronouns I prefer over anything else. I ended up settling for he/they because no one respected it anyway.
I hate when people do this, I use any pronouns I was telling this to a friend of mine and this is how it went.

Me: I use any pronouns .
Them:what about neopronouns?
Me:yeah those are fine too I really don't care.
Them:thats so weird why would you be okay with that? Just choose she/her, he/him or they/them.

I hate it, neopronouns are just as valid as any others. Although I do have one question how do you pronounce zhe/zhim? I've never heard those before.
Aaaa I'm sorry for alot of these comments OP. Your pronouns are yours alone to dictate and it seems you need more supportive people around you who at least try to understand. As someone who also uses neopronouns it's very upsetting to see other trans people use transphobic rhetoric against people who use neopronouns. 😓
I feel your pain. I know that while my online friends do respect my pronouns no matter what (since I’m not wasting my time and energy on interacting with people who don’t respect me online), most irl people will not. While I am comfortable with they/them in English (and also he/him but only if you don’t always call me that) - my favorite set of pronouns in English is thon/thons btw - there is no equivalent to they/them in German, the only options are just she, he, it, neopronouns and no pronouns in that language, and since people speak German where I live I’m kind of forced to speak it in my everyday life. Being called she gives me intense dysphoria, so that’s the one thing I want to avoid. I feel most comfortable using neopronouns (dey/deren) or no pronouns (just my name) in german, but since I know the vast majority of cis people will not respect those pronouns and just keep defaulting back to she/her (because I don’t pass as anything but female unfortunately) I felt forced to use he/him irl in the past. The thing is, while I kind of like small amounts of he/him in English I definitely don’t like being called he in German. It’s probably because the language is so agressively gendered, so the combination of all the masc nouns and adjectives and the pronouns is just too much (I do like the masc forms of most words tho). Also, cis people didn’t fucking respect the he/him pronouns either! At that point I just gave up and started telling people irl to use no pronouns for me, just to use my name.

I just hate that so many people, even other trans people, are such transphobic pieces of shit who will blatantly misgender people who use more unusual pronouns. Those who give you shit for it on this subreddit should be ashamed of themselves, we trans people, no matter what our genders and pronouns are, need to support each other, because if one kind of trans person gets pushed under the bus the rest of us will soon go down as well. We’re in this together. If we of all people don’t respect each other’s pronouns, who will?
I didn't understand them until my egg cracked. Being called ""she"" makes me comfortable and happy, so it makes sense that the word would be different for others. I don't know how to justify it to people who haven't experienced euphoria or dysphoria, but I don't think it needs to be justified. It makes people happier and doesn't harm anyone, it must be good.
I completely agree. If someone tells you their pronouns, do your best to respect it. It might take time, but apologize when you say the wrong thing. It’s all about practice.
That fucking sucks! I'm so sorry you had to experience such discrimination and dismissiveness of your identity and feelings. 

You are valid and fuck anyone that tries to gate-keep our community. The majority of us support you but we fail to speak up because we assume everyone is cool with neopronouns.
Some people believe the pronoun you use should reflect something substantial about yourself, but most people don't really know the objective implications of zhe/zhim particularly.
I'm rlly sorry you have some awful ppl in your life! also! ignore the assholes saying neopronouns are too difficult or are bad for the community. they're wrong. it's like trying to take the 't' out of lgbt, or trying to say aro/ace ppl don't belong in our community. it's exclusionism to try to appeal to shitass cis ppl and it doesn't work, it just hurts ppl.

anyways! ik I seem like the stereotypical trans guy or trans masc to a lot of people in my life, but honestly my preferred pronouns are he/xe. I usually say they're he/they, or he/xe/they. I understand the struggle with ppl not respecting neopronouns. I rlly wish they would. I not all that comfy with they/them bc it's been used to hurt me in a lot of ways. but I'm not just he/him. I wish I could say he/xe and have people accept it, without having to add the they bc ik ppl won't use xe. and it feels important to me to be able to convey that my gender is more then binary male without having to go into the specifics.

Ive been much more visible and pushy abt my neopronouns as of late, bc ik I have trans siblings like you out there. I'm often the ""token good trans"" so I'm trying to use that power for good. 

I hope you find more people who care abt you enough to actually respect your pronouns. you'll find your community eventually<3
I completely respect neopronouns! Those people who don't respect your identity aren't worth your time. I hope you can find people who respect who you are as a person!
To be honest I don't have any friends who use Neo pronouns anymore but when I did I made an effort to learn how to use them- even if I didn't understand them too much. If it makes the person happy then isn't that what matters? 
I hope OP can find better friends, zhe deserve it.
I don't think the neopronouns are OP's problem, honestly. Sure, zhir friends are being shitty about them, but from the abundant examples zhe gave it sounds like they're pretty shitty about anything that's not using whatever pronoun they feel like at the time. Sounds like zhe might need new friends.
Zhe/Zhim is soooooo freaking cool! How is it pronounces??
OP, if you see this, my condolences on the shitty behavior from your friends and loved ones. Your personal pronouns are just that: personal. Thanks for the brave post and for putting words to things I’ve felt and experienced for the 10+ years I’ve been out and in the trans community. 💖💖💖 
Sincerely, an it/its user who just lurks in this sub because of people like the ones you describe
[deleted]

Looks like I missed the shitstorm.
I use neopronouns, but I don't tell people about them because of this. I already get enough shit for being a they/he, afab, feminine looking transmasc who wants neutral language except when it comes to compliments. My binary trans ex made fun of me for neopronouns and xenogenders as well as the specific way I'm trans because it doesn't fall into there idea of nonbinary. I just want to scream that they cant be trans supportive if they make fun of the specific way I'm trans.
I feel like this is why people wanna kill us… just sayin
Personally I use they/them by default because it absolutely conforms to classical English rules for any person it could possibly reference, but if someone told me they wanted me to use different pronouns for them you bet your sweet azz I would try my best! If people aren't going to support you or at the very least lightly respect you, then it's on them, not you. I'm sorry cis people can't respect you, my fellow alien!

(If alien is offensive, I don't know, I just like the concept of being an alien; space is neat)
OP, I’m sorry you’re feeling so disrespected in your daily life. You deserve better. 

Anybody else saying they don’t understand, check out https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/ and do your own research because it’s not on OP to explain zhimself to us
Here's the thing, most people aren't educated on what neo pronouns really are. Neo pronouns are attached to some really homophobic memes, they were sort of the thing that made a lot of Transphobic people point at us and go ""this person is making up new genders look at how stupid this is!"" Etc.


A lot of people in our own community don't even know what they really are.

We aren't yet to the point where neo pronouns are known of other than them being ""made up genders"" (which is such an un educated assumption it's so dumb) and the stigma behind them will continue to make it harder for people who use them.

We're not yet there, it sucks that the people around you won't even put in the effort.

You don't have to understand to at least respect someone's pronouns. Your personal opinions shouldn't get in the way of someone doing what makes them comfortable.
I accept that everyone is allowed the pronouns they identify with but I find it hard when it’s new language. I know a lot of older people who are from a different generation have issues with this. Wouldn’t it just be better to use the persons name and not use pronouns at all. I mean why would this cause an issue with the gender fluid person?
Lol I like how everyone in this sub is giving their (not requested) opinion about whether or not they “understand” neopronouns. This is a venting post, not an advice post. I’m sure most of us can relate to being misgendered and forced into boxes. There’s no need to add your two cents about the understandability of OP’s pronouns.
“It’s too hard” isn’t an excuse when they’re learning and using new words and terms every week. Like you learned an entire language, maybe two, learning a new pronoun isn’t hard, it’s just practice
Bruh I swear why can’t people just not be transphobic? Like i feel like the only way I might use em wrong is by either me mispronouncing them or not know how to use them but you said that you explained to them how to use your pronouns and probably also pronounced them to. For fucks sake I’m cis and even i know how to use your pronouns it’s not hard to say zhe/zhim instead of literally anything they want to use
As a fellow neos users, I feel you OP. You deserve respect.
Some people are incredibly lazy. Lazy enough to squeeze someone inside their limited vocabulary and understanding. I get so angry when people have to go through stuff like this. Same for the OP here. Zhe definitely deserves better people around zhim. :(
I have exactly one person who uses ze/zir pronouns for me (I am comfortable with both ze/zir and she/her, but ze/zir has a bit more of a connected feeling to me).

I really wish more people would try. It shows respect and compassion towards me. I also find it unacceptable for people to not use neo pronouns when that is the only pronoun that feels correct to a person. I'm sorry you are dealing with this.

(if I may) _\*hugs\*_
[removed]
Those people are stupid, your pronouns are zhe/zhim so people should refer to you by zhe/zhim, they shouldn't decide what your pronouns are, it's your pronouns. not theirs.
[removed]
i fully respect zhe/zhim, but my brain is ruined and to me it reads like an old German man complaining about someone...

that being said, OP is reasonably angry, zhe deserve to have their pronouns respected

to be honest i don’t understand neopronouns as much. not in a disrespectful way, just that i can’t keep track and sometimes it’s hard for me to remember. But i will always respect it and use them for people if they want me to. My friend and I just had a conversation about it. I’m trans and people weren’t calling me the correct pronouns. And how people need to understand how to respect people. You don’t need to understand something to respect it. I don’t understand sometimes, but I respect still.
Using different pronouns really isn’t difficult, they’re just making excuses not to try. Idk if it’s just me being very accustomed to different pronouns but it really is not hard at all. I’m sorry you had to experience that, it’s so frustrating 😞💕
The amount of people literally spreading neopronoun hate on a post about neopronoun hate, and the amount of upvotes they have, is very upsetting.
NEOPRONOUNS ARE VALID

I don't use neopronouns but I respect those who do. Kudos to you for breaking lingual gender constructs. I hope you get to make friends who respect your pronouns.
First of all: that sucks :( booooo 
2nd, how do you use those in a sentence? I don't know many people who use neos an most of them are *noun*/*noun*self, so it's not too different from regular he or she or they. Im not too used to xe or zhe or e or stuff like that
3rd: I totally understand not feeling comfortable with normal pronouns. While I use he/him most of the time, i also occasionally use bee/bees/beeself, but usually I don't tell people about those so they don't get used :/
As someone who uses it/it's neos, I understand. Of course, I can't understand 100% bc I use he/him too. I am so sorry that you have to deal with that, I really hope it gets better soon
As a xe/xir I absolutely feel you, when people ask I just say they/he because they NEVER remember.
i relate hard, as someone using neopronouns myself. lots of trans people, LET ALONE cis people don't get it.

Lemme just say it for the people in the back:

> Neopronouns are a category of new (neo) pronouns that are increasingly used in place of “she,” “he,” or “they” when referring to a person. 
>  
> Some people prefer using neopronouns as an alternative gender neutral pronoun set. This could be because they want to avoid singular ""they"" being confused with plural ""they"" because neopronouns express something about them or their gender (like xenogenders), or because they feel more comfortable using neopronouns over any of the standard pronoun options.

Oh and have a [link](https://neopronoun.carrd.co/) about neopronouns.

People are so annoying, my god! I don’t understand neopronouns or why anyone would use them, but if people feel comfortable being called something other than she/her they/them or he/him I will try as hard as I can to use their pronouns correctly! Sorry you’ve had such shitty experiences. I hope you find some friends who can respect your pronouns. Zhe/zhim is 100% valid <3
Maybe it would help this person if you explained to them what zhe/zhim means and why it makes you feel more comfortable

The beet we can do is explain, it’s the only way to combat other people’s ignorance. And when that fails walk away; they’re rarely worth it
People who dont experience it dont understand often and its sad. I wish you the best, and hope you can find someone who will resepct your pronouns and who you are
Gender is a social construct and thus pronouns are an extension of that. Society and the language we use are familiar with the pronouns he/him, she/her, they/them, but neopronouns aren’t used enough commonly to really weigh as much as the others as far as I can tell. While the honest thing to do would be to respect someone’s pronouns regardless of what they are, it is also understandable that people may not find it entirely applicable. This of course is my thoughts on the matter.
hot take: ive never understood why people say “gender is a construct!” then completely 180 when it comes to xenos and neopronouns.
I use she/him and there’s exactly one person in my life who actually uses my pronouns ;-;
Zhe/zhim
As a cis person, I get not understanding, but I don't get not respecting OP as a person. Everyone, including zhim, deserves to have their pronouns respected. It's not that hard when you get over yourself and give your best effort. People understand that you won't be perfect about it at first.

My biggest issue is that I can barely remember faces and names, best I can do is they them if I don't talk to you on a regular basis because otherwise I would have to guess
I’m sorry🥹🥲
I don't understand the use of it/its, I feel like it is dehumanizing, and I don't understand what the other pronouns represent... I use She/Her... but that's for me.

Even if I don't understand neopronouns, I believe because I am a binary transgirl, it doesn't mean I can avoid using others' pronouns. If you feel like using a certain pronoun, my opinion doesn't matter, I must and will use your prefered pronouns. You want to use it? I will use it for you because it makes YOU feel ok with yourself.

It's not something hard to do to respect one's pronouns. Who wants to be called it I will call it, who uses she I will call she, who uses ze i will use ze. People must be respected, so those who don't respect the pronouns you want to be called as, they are all just assholes.
So. I have no problem with them. But every time I hear Zhim... I swear I just think of Invader Zim. And it's not that I think it's funny.. it was just my favorite show as a kid lol.
So, I have issues with the neopronouns because nobody I know uses them. Also, I am autistic with ADHD and my brain is complicated enough right now trying to understand some of the new information about how it works. My child is non-binary and prefers they/them. OK cool! I am a transman, so I respect their wishes. However, there are some days where they come out and go ""hey! I feel more feminine today! Use she/her!"" That alone throws my brain for loopsies. Then, when I finally get brain to comprehend, I go ""OK!"" Then...next day were back to they/them. 

So, from a NT pov, they have no reason to really fight these neopronouns once they are used to it and reminded to use them and if they fight back, go no contact for a bit. From a ND pov...it is a very grey area bc there is a lot more going on up there than what we show. I honestly do try to learn all of the stuff that pops up in our community, is just...takes a bit for brain to truly comprehend what is being said. Is very tiring. But in all honesty, I really hope the people in your life get MUCH better at accepting your pronouns and using them correctly.
I’ve never understood the hate for those types of neopronouns either. Like the ones that are like nouns, I get being confused by them and a lot of people just say ‘I’m not gonna do that’ because it’s weird, but the ones that are remaking he/him, she/her and they/them are all fine because you can just try to compare it to the main three in your head
I'm on team ""call me whatever"". I absolutely respect pronouns, but I do find it exhausting. If it means a lot to someone, I don't see it as a huge inconvenience. It does make people hard to interact with though. If you get fired up every time someone accidentally genders you, that will make sure you have few friends.
The only pronoun I use to address someone is you. Just use their name, problem solved.
I can understand neopronouns but habits are hard to break. We’ve been conditioned to expect a certain set of pronouns so when new ones are added, it’s a bit difficult to adjust. I do my best, but I usually use they if I’m not sure. 

Being 100% honest, I’m just thankful when folks use the right pronouns for me, and I use they/them. Do I feel like a they? No, but it’s better than being binaried. Unfortunately, not everyone is going to get it, but those that do should be cherished and loved.
I feel like the queer community is veering off onto a path that doesn’t resonate with me anymore. I support you doing whatever you want but all these kids using gender identities that were created yesterday is a little exhausting to me. But I don’t wanna be that bisexual hypocrite that views this as a stepping stone to your true identity when I’ve been told that about my sexuality.

I just feel bad for the binary trans people that have to share a label with a million other identities that aren’t even technically trans by definition. It’s not lost on me that in the 2000s, edgy emo was the trend, in the 2010s, indie hipster was the trend, and now, gender non conforming is the trend.

I just hope it’s a legit thing people are going through and not a way to enter the community without actually being queer.
i’m going to go through these comments and downvote all neopronoun hate. neopronouns are valid asf.
only pronouns i refuse to use is it/its, because trauma.

i grew up gnc with an ftm parent and a homophobic father. my parent and i were called an “it” on many occasions in a degrading manner, so anytime i see someone exclusively use that as a pronoun i avoid them because i can’t come to terms with that right now.

i won’t ever call someone out on this or give them shit if that person’s friends refer to them that way, but i just can’t. call me transphobic, i wont put my comfort behind someone else’s
I have to talk to way too many people every day just to remember a special set of pronouns just for you, I’m sorry.

""Hate"" is a strong word.

I completely respect it, but how do i use this in a different language so im properly identifying you? That’s the only major issue I have with neopronouns. I also speak Spanish so I want to be sure when i’m speaking i dont use él or ella but ig in this instance you wouldn’t prefer usted, which is as neutral as it gets. but then there’s many grammatical things that i have trouble with.
I don't really ""get"" neopronouns. I'd even go so far as to say they sometimes seem kind of silly to me.

The key word there being *me*.

I've got enough empathy to recognise that they don't seem that way to the people who use them. 

And it's a trivially small effort on my part to try to remember and use whatever pronouns someone asks for.

So yeah. I don't get it, but there's a lot of things I don't get but still support, and this is one of them.
I agree with many parts of this post, but I kinda get irked by complaining about people only using on group of pronouns, if you provided multiple and people find it ""easier"" it is justifiable that they use one of them. I of course have friends that use pronouns like she/them and he/them, but I tend to use she or he more often, and me using they/them for a binary person who doesn't use exclusively those pronouns is me speaking a lot, in which case my brain defaults to gender neutral pronouns. Although keep in mind, I do agree with you, I always make the case that neoprounouns are valid as long as they're pronouns.
Ok so first I feel bad for you and the hate you got personally I don't understand using pronouns outside of he/him she/her and they/them because of my understanding but you made some points that did help pronouns are based upon on how you feel and I didn't think about that specific detail emotions are complicated so of course pronouns can be too. I usually try my best to respect people's pronouns because I'm trans mtf and I want mine to be respected I used to feel weird about they/them only because of the English language they/them is plural but as a pronoun it's singular but now I'm used to using they/them as a pronoun so it doesn't feel weird anymore I've even used it in reference to a friend I didn't want to reveal had told me they might also be trans but didn't want to refer to as he/him since that's what most people would think they are because I thought it was non-binary until you said you didn't like they/them because you're non-binary I don't understand it/it's tho could you explain that one please I'm following the same logic as your sister calling you an it/it's sounds kinda disrespectful but based on the post I don't think you see it/it's as referring to something that's anything less than being a human being so can you explain to me why you see they/them as non-binary but not it/it's. I'm still new to neopronouns as well I understand there's a bunch but I don't understand what they all mean or represent, is there anything you could tell me about those as well? Also sorry if any of these comes off as offensive it's not supposed to.

Edit:After reading the comments I think I understand the reasoning behind other pronoun usage, so my question is what do you feel like the differences in it/it's and they/them is as well as the issue of they/them isn't non-binary like I thought and more information on neopronouns.
If you think he/she/they are the only pronouns people can go by I automatically hate you, and I almost can't hate people.
Pronouns probably should be treated as an attribute similar to one’s name; at first you can struggle to remember them but eventually they should stick. We (we are plural, so our pronouns tend to be dependent on whether you are referencing the group or a member) feel like this mindset is necessary to negate the argument of having “too many pronouns”.

I'm terrified to meet someone who uses neopronounes, because I WILL mess up and someone is going to get accidentally hurt
How does one pronounce ""zhe/zhim""?
Neopronouns aren’t for me, but I would still show the same respect for someone who uses neopronouns. It’s really not that hard to understand
How do you pronounce your pronouns? I’ve never met someone who uses zhe/zhim and I’ve never heard them used and I’m curious. Is the h silent or is it like a sh sound with a zzz added? I feel very dumb for asking this and I swear it comes from a place of the deepest and purest love💛🤍💜🖤 I’ve thought about using neopronouns because people would lose the “but they/them is confusing because I’m used to it being pluralllll” excuse and they could either use the neopronoun or admit their transphobia, but I have a feeling I’d be disappointed in the amount of people who would just drop the caring-but-incompetent act and admit their transphobia.

(Edit: spelling mistake fixed: if to I’d)
One thing I’ve learned is that people don’t usually bother to mix up the pronouns they use for you if you use more then one I use She/He/They and well some people will just pick one and stick with it cause our brains are looking for the quickest route possible memory wise it doesn’t want to think too hard. Some of my friends will mix it up from time to time but people in general are just lazy really and that took me awhile to realize
I don’t personally use neopronouns, but I also fall under the gender-fluid umbrella. I personally like they and it because both can be used for anyone, and they cover the fact that no matter what my gender is, I am me. A person. So I understand why people like neopronouns or feel better using them because sometimes there isn’t one that feels like it’s truly you.

I’m sorry you have to deal with this, and while I know that I personally don’t have to deal with it to the level you do, I understand. You are valid and you are perfect as who you are, and nobody can take that away from you.

And to the people in the comments being assholes,consider how zhe feels. Imagine what it feels like to be misgendered and remember that even if you don’t understand, it costs nothing to be a good person to zhim or anyone else.
I used to think neopronouns were confusing and to be entirely honest, I wasn't sure whether it was real (hypocritical, coming from me- a trans man, I know)

Since then, I've met two other people who go by neopronouns and I actually feel more disgusted by the hate than I could ever feel at the people that use them. I'm greatly disappointed in myself, and I hope the people who have been saying these things to you will end up feeling guilty for causing you harm and come to an understanding of who you actually are.

You're a wonderful person, and just because your pronouns are different doesn't mean you deserve all those comments and backlash. I'm sorry this community isn't as accepting as it should be.

Honestly, I don't really understand a lot of neopronouns (specifically noun-self ones) but I'm still going to use them for people if they want me to. I don't have to understand to be respectful (but I am still trying to learn, I want to understand). Also, it really does suck when you have multiple pronouns and only get called one. Mine are he/it, but I only get called he/him because that's the ""normal"" one. People have multiple pronouns for a reason!
I’m sorry people are so shitty. I don’t understand why people make such a big deal out of it. It’s fine if you don’t understand, you don’t need to understand you just need to be respectful. If you want a friend who will actually respect your pronouns no matter what they are feel free to message me
So I have no problem with neopronouns and definitely try to use them the couple of instances it’s come up but it is tricky. 

I get why he/him and she/her doesn’t work for you but I am curious at why they/them doesn’t? Like you didn’t really explain it (not that you have to) but also why would your “friend” default to he/him, when an acceptable (in their mind) analog would be they/them and it seems like it might offend you less?

I’m sorry you got such shit treatment by a friend, seems like you made a reasonable request from someone that seems like they’d be supportive.
I’m sorry that you have to deal with those kind of people because you don’t use “traditional” pronouns. Your pronouns are valid and people should use them- since that’s what makes you comfortable. Pronouns aren’t supposed to make others comfortable, it’s meant to make the user of those pronouns comfortable. I hope you find a group of people who will respect your pronouns.
Genderfluid AFAB here. Some days, I feel differnt by the hour. Like OP, sometimes I wonder what pronouns actually fit me. I'm still figuring myself out, still trying to learn about the LGBTQ+ community.

I'm also an identical twin. (Twinsie is cis.)

On the one hand, I 100% get the outrage over being misidentified. It's infuriating. People would/do get our *proper nouns* wrong, yes, even on purpose. They know us literally our whole lives and still misidentify us: how??? On the other hand, pronouns have never been personalized in the English language. You need to recognize that you're challenging the function and definition of pronouns, if for nothing else than to manage your own expectations. It's more than just your identifiers, even if that's all it is to you.

Languages change and evolve, and yes, every word is made up, but if we all created our own words and syntactic rules, communication would be impossible. Acceptance of neopronouns will require time, effort, and patience before society feels comfortable with the shift. I'm glad you vented here, but it's gonna be a long road. That's just the reality. As both a twin and genderfluid person, I hope you can find a way to deal with these frustrations in a more positive manner for your own mental well-being. Being misidentified sucks, especially when it's done intentionally. But don't let that anger eat at you. Find creative ways to reinforce your chosen pronouns, be patient and gracious, and consider establishing boundaries about it. At a certain line, Twinsie and refuse to acknowledge the wrong names; it forces the issue when we do that.
Zhe/zhim is the first neo pronoun I ever heard of, before even the idea of using they/them, the main character in my story I was planning (never actually wrote it) immediately became zhe/zhim. Only realised zhe was a self insert years later, a I want to be self insert, the me currently self insert of a young girl who was just a bystander in most of her life was more obvious.
Neopronouns are weird to me and I don’t like using them but if all I have to do to make someone feel comfortable is change what word I say to identify them with then I would absolutely try my best to do that
sorry that people are being shitty in the comments, op. you're right.
I'm terribly sorry this has happened to you. Personally I don't understand neopronouns that well but I will try my best to respect them. I just have a lot of other queer friends so sometimes pronouns are hard for me to remember since I can accidentally get them mixed up. That and I'm worried about pronunciation. So I'm sorry if I get anything wrong, it's just hard to remember sometimes since I'm under lots of stress. I really do hope people respect your preferred pronouns though! No one deserves to be misgendered!
I need to clarify before this that I’m not trans, so I have no right to actually argue about this and if I’m wrong or insulting about anything then I’m happy to learn, but I also personally don’t see why it’s such a big deal? I don’t know anyone in real life who uses neopronouns, but as long as you explain how to use them then it really isn’t that difficult????

The way I see it is that our language is fucking thousands of years old, and the majority of it has changed or become outdated in even just the last few years. People like to stick with he/him she/her they/them, but to others those are outdated as well. I mean we’ve realised gender is so fluid, is it really that hard to understand that the pronouns we created so long ago don’t fit everyone anymore???? Gender isn’t binary, so why would or should our pronouns stop evolving to account for all the different people who are just now able to live as they truly are???? It’s just wild to me why people care sm about a goddamn pronoun I stg

If it’s okay with you, can I ask how to use your pronouns? I’d love to learn :))
Yes, I use she/they (in english, in portuguese I use ela/dela), I respect others people pronouns as I get respected by mine, neo pronouns are ok if it's not in a serious case or matter. It/its is tolerable for me tho. He/him/his, she/her/hers and singular they/them/theirs is way more aceptable... sorry but I'm a bit conservative about it
i totally get you.. i thought i was a trans man but thinking about it, i understand what you mean. i want to use neopronouns that have no pre-existing gender (male, female, nonbinary) attached to them because i want to identify as all… wow.. i deadass just came out to myself in a reddit comment. shits wild lmao
I am so lost
:0 I love your pronouns ive never seen those ones before and i mean i mightve but i dont remember it therefore it didnt happen and this is the first time im seeing them and they are cool 👌
Ppl wanna be victims so bad 😂
Because what the fuck is Zhe , what even does that mean , you just put z infront of the word they saying and expect it to change ,
Frankly no hate towards you or your pronouns but in general i hate how pronouns are such a big thing like Oh no i call a “they” a she. Boom. Chaos. Like wtf i think theres just more relevant and important things in the world to care about but you re mad because i cant remember that you’re a xie.
I have a brain that cant retain information from conversations so i dont care much about what people tell me. 
But its that they make such a big deal of it. 
The universe is huge everyone is a speak, a dot in existence i just have no care for pronouns. 
Ill just address you by your name with respect ofc
[removed]
I mean, I *kinda* understand it/its. I feel uncomfortable when using it for people because I feel like I’m kinda dehumanizing them. But that’s a ME problem
This. I don't really know anyone that uses them personally but I know there are a lot of neopronouns out there that exist. I'm afraid I'll mess them up. It also shames me to admit that I occasionally mess up they/them with my SO too (albeit very very rarely). It makes me feel super crappy everytime it happens.
As long as you genuinenly try and don't make it about your or make condescending comments, you're fine.
[removed]
Why wouldn't being bald matter almost everyone experiences it and nearly everyone feels bad or ashamed because of it. Shouldn't that make it matter? (Sorry if I made this confusing I can be more specific if needed)
Same, I don’t understand them but I also don’t understand marine biology, doesn’t mean I don’t respect marine biologists
right thats where i am
Exactly, i dont see how people don’t see the obvious hypocrisy of hateing neopronouns while being trans themselves.
Like i stg 
“I can’t respect someone because I don’t personally understand their identity. “
Is the only reason transphobes exist anywhere at all. Gaaah/vent
Hell misgendering pops up regardless of pronouns unless you are 100% cis passing. Even then, cis folks get misgendered too on occasion. Intent matters just as much as the words said. If someone is attempting to be respectful I'm not going to hold them to the fire for occasional mistakes.
I think it's ok for them to say it's difficult or express it's weird but only expressing that is ok I don't think it's ok to use it as an excuse sort of like how you'd say something was heavy after putting carrying it it's ok for you to say it's heavy but you shouldn't leave it outside because it's heavy if that makes sense
AAAAA OMG TYSM FOR USING ZHE/ZHIM FOR ME THIS MEANS SO MUCH :'DDDDD
for real, zhey got the response that zhey were venting about. i love this sub but sometimes it sucks. neopronouns arent hard to understand at all. im sorry OP about the comments :/
ikr? even in some of these comments people were being dicks to zhim and invalidating zhim like what’s the need
[deleted]
WTaF??  Cisgender here. I would equate the talk of those other cis ppl to be similar to being called the wrong name because “you didn’t like how weird it sounded”.  Then proceeded to say you’d never talk to to anyone with that name because…[reason] *right to their face.*   Okay, so it’s not a pronoun you’re used to hearing or saying, I get that, but the aversion to using neopronouns is taught or learned.  Either family, social media, news, religion, friends, somewhere that is learned or an aversion to what isn’t readily understood.  Also, many people don’t understand how to use them, what they are, or what they mean. If someone asked me to refer to them in a certain way, use a unique name, using particular pronouns, is married to the Berlin Wall (objectum sexual), or whatever—if I cared about them as a human being, I will do what makes them feel comfortable (within the limits of the law.)
A lot of people use nounbased pronouns somewhat metaphorically. 

I read an article a while back that I’m trying to find again which was written by someone neurodivergent that felt no connection to the binary, neurotypical understanding of gender, and understood nounbased pronouns as a way of expressing their relationship with gender to others. 

Kudos btw for trying to understand. As a disclaimer I’m a binary transman who only uses he/him, and I’m still learning, too. But I know what it’s like when people say, “I respect everyone, but I draw the line at _____.” I know for a fact I am on the other side of that line for so many people and so are a lot of us and I just can’t fathom the lack of empathy it takes to draw the line again for someone else!!

Edit: ofc I don’t know everything about nounbased pronouns so this is only one reason for using them and i am open to anyone else’s experiences or ideas (especially since I’m a binary person)
Ikr, I'll never understand why it's sooo hard for poor mushy brained people who uphold toxic standards as a hobby.
I’ve noticed a lot of people automatically converting Op’s pronouns to (z)they/them
It seems like an accident but op uses zhe/zhim
I just thought I’d point it out because im pretty sure people don’t notice they did that./gen/nm
Imagine he/him but with a ""z"" in front.
People complain about new pronouns, however in the 1800s and before then, we had whole rounds of inventing and trying new pronouns that never stuck around. People just want an easy out I guess, no care for feelings or meanings.
Yeah, it’s really disappointing to see so many people in this thread throwing others under the bus. On a trans subreddit nonetheless.
My main problem with neopronouns is probably that the way i was introduced to it was with that whole dreamsexual/dreamgender stuff where they said their pronouns were ""dream/dreamself"" and I've not been able to take them seriously because of it (although i tried for a friend who used xe/xem to at least not gender them)
[deleted]
It's not really all that different than names. And they/them will almost certainly remain as default 'I don't know their gender/pronouns' and then when you do, you use their pronouns just like you use their name. 

Another thing to keep in mind about who knows to use your pronouns is that for non-passing trans people (or lots of enby people, etc.) people *won't* know what pronoun to use. If you're still masc looking but prefer she or femme looking and prefer he, those aren't what they will say naturally. 

This is what got me to get completely over my own issues about neo-pronouns: ""I took my phone and opened tinder and started swiping; got a few matches and texted one and then snapped a few times."" 20-30 years ago this sentence would make *no* sense to almost anyone. Yet you know exactly what I mean (even if it is a little bit of a hackneyed sentence). Language advances, especially when we're willing to use it.
They’re just words, they’re all made up and none of them are things we say “naturally”, they’re literally all learned, they all have limited contexts and none of them are truly universal. If some people feel its worth it to distinguish themselves with uncommon pronouns who are we to say that’s wrong? Like, you’re right to identify that it will be a challenge for these people to establish their pronouns in the common imagination, but struggle is a part of life and what can we say if someone has decided that it’s a worthwhile struggle for them? 

If we happen to have an emotional reaction to some pronouns, it seems like it’s on us to unpack that and have a confrontation with whatever it is making us uncomfortable rather than digging in our heels and centering our comfort over the desires of those people.*

*I am and will continue to be quite bad at using neopronouns for some time. They have little weight or currency in my frame of reference but I’m willing to work on it and I don’t think they should be delegitimized or invalidated.
The amount of explanation necessary is literally just ""I use Zhe/Zhim"" Those are just words used to refer to someone, there's nothing deep about it. anyone can use he/him, she/her, they/them, or anything regardless of their gender because pronouns are uncorrelated with gender. There certainly are some cultural associations between some pronouns and some genders but not everyone fit within traditional stereotypes/norms and while it cost nothing to respect someone's pronouns, the benefice is immense for the recipient.  
It must feel awful for op to be constantly misgendered like that, and we can \*feel\* through zhims replies how happy zhe is when people use zhims pronouns correctly.

It's not hard to use neo-pronouns, and requires very little explanation. It's like learning someone's name or nickname. If you knew 2 people named William and they both went by Will, would you tell the first Bill you meet it's too hard and you'd rather call them Will? English has been struggling to find a gender neutral pronoun for over a hundred years and I think we're still trying to find one that sticks. So in the meantime people are gonna come up with new ones and try them out. I think they/them has the most history and likely to be the go to, but language is weird and there's no such thing as ""real words"". Zhe/zhim isn't confusing, and it takes a second to catch on when some one is using it.
I'm not sure if it's worth it, and yeah it definitely is hassle to be like this. No other pronoun fits me better than zhe/zhim tho, and I think it's easier for my friends than me constantly changing pronouns everyday.

And yeah, people outside of my social circle won't know my pronouns, but isn't that normal? Most people don't know a person's pronouns until they become friends or check their bio.

And we're not all going to use neopronouns lol. Saying ""if we all used neopronouns how will we know what to call each other?"" is the same as ""if we're all gay how will we reproduce?"" It's never going to happen, and if it will I think we'd know how to address each other. It'd be like names.
If it wasnt worth the hassle nobody would use them. Also all pronouns are made up so it really doesnt matter much if it's what people want.
You say we can change language, which requires people to use this new way of communicating over time, then you say we shouldn't be asking for people to use our neo pronouns because not enough people use them.

Changes in how we use language starts somewhere and is never widely used or accepted at first. If we just stop using words just because they are new (or that they are hard to relate to your own experiences), language would stop evolving.

It all starts somewhere and takes a lot of time, but telling people to stop asking people to respect their identity and pronouns is anti-progress.
New gender neutral pronouns have been invented throughout history in the English language. If the person you’re speaking to understands how important it is to respect your identity, they’ll figure out how to use your correct pronouns. Zhe is literally out here talking about how many people are saying this stuff to zhim every day so I don’t think you needed to say it. Zhe knows communication is a two way street and zhe has tried a LOT to be conducive to the people around zhim but they refuse to respect any pronouns zhe has tried to bring up
Yes!! I really don't understand the hate for neopronouns like it's not doing you any harm?? Just respect it?? As long as their pronouns aren't offensive like using slurs for pronouns then why not respect it? The hate for neopronouns makes no sense
Oh it's he/him but you replace the h with z. The h is there for aesthetic purposes lol
Oh I asked but I might've missed someone else's, where?
They/Them and Zhe/Zhim are different sets of pronouns, that's pretty much it really.
That’s like asking the difference of she/her and he/him lol what
https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/

I saw this helpful link above.
You don't sound like you're refusing to use zhim's pronouns though, which is kinda the issue the other people were doing. making mistakes and trying your best to be respectful is what's important.

I don't use neo-pronouns, but my twin brother sometimes has issues using she/her and I understand why, as he's not perfect and is used to me being a ""guy,"" so it takes some learning. Especially so since we live so far apart now.
It’s not binary trans people that are the problem, it’s truscum. I’ve seen non binary people get riled up at different pronouns, it’s horrible.
Sorry you have to deal with that shit. You are who you are and it’s completely valid to express that with your correct pronouns. As someone else said, people use “it” to refer to kids all the time, for example when they say “is it a boy or girl?”

And even if nobody had ever heard the word “it” in their life, you deserve respect, period.
https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/

Some people don’t feel like they/them fits. It may be because those folks don’t identify as specifically non-binary and wish for pronouns that are closer to one side or the other or are not associated with the societal expectations for non-binary people the way they/them is now, or for a million other reasons, or for no reason. It may just not feel right. 

Gender neutral pronouns have been around, with new ones being invented, throughout all of recorded history.  

As a trans man, if someone refused to call me “he” and would only use “they” I would be very upset by that. It doesn’t matter to me that “they” is neutral; it doesn’t work for me. If I have told someone to call me “he” and they keep saying “they” then they’re misgendering me. 

Sidenote, many intersex people have binary genders; being intersex has nothing to do with gender. It just means you were born with more ambiguous sex characteristics. Many intersex people may never even know they’re intersex.
Well for you it fits. But for some of those people it doesn’t. That’s really all there is to it, neos make people more comfortable.
Is this in ref to op? I cant tell 😓
Sorry you had to do that. It really sucks that people aren’t willing to try. You deserve respect.
I agree. It sounds like zhe has had so many conversations and tried so hard to be conducive to their feelings and explained zhimself like 400 times so at this point it’s on them to figure it out. OP deserves better.
It's pronounced zee/zim!
Shitstorm is kind of an understatement tbh. I can’t believe I saw this type of bs on a trans subreddit of all places. Like got damn
A gender fluid person doesn’t necessarily feel like all genders all the time. He, she, or they might apply to them some of the time, but always calling them one of them could cause dysphoria. Here’s an idea! Try your best! Just like with learning someone’s new traditional pronouns it’s a learning curve! Its not going to be an instant or easy change but just saying “I find it hard so I’m not gonna try” just isn’t ok.
Yeah lots of very uncalled-for statements and ""opinions"" here. Pretty disgusting for a trans sub, people here should be better.
Exactly! Holy shit some of these people are dumb
[removed]
I think you misunderstand nounself pronouns. They’re not saying they feel like that thing, it’s just that those pronouns they have a connection to. 

Also the excuse of “thats why we aren’t taken seriously” is literally a bigoted argument that started with truscum to invalidate non-op trans people, that was later used to invalidate non-binary people, and is now being used to invalidate a subsection of non-binary people.
[removed]
Do you use that argument when someone changes their name to one you haven't hear before? ""Oh, sorry, it's not in my vocab and sets me on edge so I'm just going to pick a common name for you that is somewhat inline with your gender.""
hey; i think you misunderstand what xenogenders are. no one (at least i hope) is saying their gender is a cat/fairy/cloud. they’re just trying to describe how they experience the abstract concept of gender.
idk why ur bringing up xenogenders when they arent mentioned in the post ??
So OP expresses discomfort for a friend refusing to use the correct pronouns, and you come in trying to DISPROVE the poor fucker's identity?

Get out of here with that performative support bullshit. You can't claim to support somebody the sentence after saying you think it's bullshit.
I'm sorry, I've been (and am on) vacation, and the team in general has been a bit busy lately. We've been trying our best to keep up, but we just saw this post, and I'm cleaning it up as best as possible.
It's creating a different pronoun so ots something more comfortable than he/him for zhim  they don't emotionally like the usual male pronouns and want something that doesn't upset them. I may not totally understand neo pronouns but I can understand that some things upset different people. If I hear someone call me ma'am it makes me upset because I'm not a woman do I feel uncomfortable. They feel this same discomfort for those pronouns and found something that doesn't cause that feeling.
Zhe wants you to use them to refer to zhim like this.
You could have just said the last part my dude - the fact that you went out of your way to post that first half contradicts itself
""I'm not gonna be disrespectful""

""I think it's silly""

Pick one, dick.
yo am I getting downvoted for my pronouns? In r/trans ? Sad
I'm curious, how is it that only one person uses your pronouns when you list she/him? Are you asking for literally she/him/his (i.e. She loves his own homemade bread?) Or is it a typo? (btw, I don't think this is invalid, just hard [and some of the most worthwhile things in life are hard])

(I also literally only have one person who uses ze/zir pronouns for me instead of she/her, probably because I use either ze/zir or she/her and people just tend to stick to ""muscle memory"" when it comes to my pronouns?)
You make a great point, but this post is not really a discussion post about it/its pronouns.
[removed]
the basic thing for the first is that pronouns are a form of gender expression, but that doesn't mean that a given pronoun corresponds to a gender identity (example: I'm agender, but I feel most comfortable with fae/faer or it/its; sometimes she/her but it depends on who you are I suppose :p)

it/its for trans people in particular is from a sourced from reclamation of tactics of dehumanization (often associated with the voidpunk subculture, at least in my brain), but reasons of use could vary a lot (as with other pronouns)
[deleted]
I'm not going to ban but asking to use pronouns other than he/she/they isn't extreme. Refusing to use other's pronouns is pretty extreme.
Yeah, no wonder zhe used it in the message.
[removed]

He/him but with a ""z"" in front.
I assume it's he/him but with a ""z"" in front.
Bro that just means you dont support neos
How would you feel if someone just couldn’t tolerate using your pronouns of the day?
Fuck that shit. Why is it intolerable? Why do you get to decide what other peoples geneder is, what makes them comfortable. What based on how they look? We exist as a group because others decided we were intolerable, don’t do the same for eachother as well. That just makes you just as bad as them.
Don't feel bad. I will catch myself using he him pronouns for me. I'm solidly they/she non binary, but it's hard to unpack years or even decades of habit
Whether they “help the progression of the community” doesn’t matter. Trans people don’t help the progression of the gay community, we also encourage regression for people who already don’t respect gay people. That doesn’t mean people should stop being themselves.

In summary, [this image](https://i.redd.it/as3hte9s0xg91.jpg)
Well, I agree it is important, I was just worried people would disagree and say it’s not as big as identity? idk. Though tbh yeah any dysphoria-inducing trait intersects with identity

(to be clear for me it’s a huge fear, I know it will be ok if it happens but it’s just a fear)
I've heard there are many benefits
Respect is the key word. I feel the same on this. I don’t need to understand it to respect it.
Could you explain deeper what you mean by not understanding? It is that you don’t know how they function in a sentence or some other type of lack of understanding?
Check out r/TransTryouts for more gender affirmation!
Question op, how would one pronounce this irl? Is it just  how you would say ze? Or does it have a verbal h? Or  something else?
They said they were non-binary and trans, or under the umbrella, and many people under those umbrellas use neo-pronouns.
not it doesn't have to. I have a friend who uses both she/her and he/him. Isn't a guy, isn't a woman. But absolutely hates being called nonbinary. He's just himself and is simply trans.    
Or literally how OP is talking how zhe is genderfluid and wants a pronoun that fits with all three answers. And especially with how at this point they/them is established as the non-binary pronoun, I get it might feel really off on a day zhe doesn't feel like that.
[removed]
Oh ok! I thought it might have a “sh” sound and that’s what confused me, tysm!
I just woke up and am trying my best to clean it up, sorry about being so late, I'm on vacation in another country. >.<
Dreamsexual (as in about the Minecraft youtuber) was a 4chan psyop, unsurprisingly. 

Dream/dreamself neopronouns (as in linking your experience of gender to the experience of dreaming) was a thing before the Minecraft youtuber.

Again, I recognise that it's a far out concept if you aren't introduced to it lightly, but radical acceptance is a cornerstone of the movement.
>And they/them will almost certainly remain as default 'I don't know their gender/pronouns' 

I didn't think about that. It's true though.

>Another thing to keep in mind about who knows to use your pronouns is that for non-passing trans people (or lots of enby people, etc.) people won't know what pronoun to use.

You're right. Since pronouns are based on gender, it's ""easy"" to misgender someone, or to not know what to use.

>Language advances, especially when we're willing to use it.

My primary language is french and our ""they"" is a new pronoun created for the purpose of having a mixed pronoun (or gender neutral?) which is ""iel"" (mix between ""il"" (he) and ""elle"" (she)). It's now in the dictionary. They should do the same in other languages I think.
[removed]
Thanks for your explanation. I don't say that's wrong, not at all. I was just genuinely trying to understand because reading op's post, it felt like a lot of work. 

Anyway, if someone would ask me to refer to them with neopronouns, I would do it. I would never refuse  because I want to respect them.
I understand that op feels awful for being misgendered. I don't say that neopronouns shouldn't exist. I just genuinely want to understand, and was wondering if it was worth the efforts op has to put in explaining that. But I better understand that yes, it's worth it.

Also my primary language is french, and we have a mixed pronoun now (or gender neutral?), which is ""iel"" that's a mix between ""il"" (he) and ""elle"" (she). It's a new pronoun, unlike ""they"" in english, that is already used for plural.
>English has been struggling to find a gender neutral pronoun for over a hundred years and I think we're still trying to find one that sticks.

Yeah my primary language is french and a gender neutral pronoun was created and is now in the dictionary: iel (mix between il(he) and Elle(she)).
[removed]
I struggled with the pros and cons of neopronouns when I came out.  Sure, it isn’t easy for a lot of people (often including the people who use them!), but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it.  If it is right for you, it is automatically worth it.

It is so upsetting to me to see other trans people using the same rhetoric that is used by cis people to validate transphobia and misgendering and apply it to people with neopronouns.  “I just think we should follow the rules of science/language”  “It’s just a word, why do you let it define you?”  “That’s too hard for me to remember.”  “I wouldn’t have known unless you told me, so it isn’t fair.”  All of those arguments are fundamentally ridiculous, and they have all also been used for gender non-conforming cis people, binary trans people, non-binary trans people who use they/them.  It’s just queer-/transphobia with the goal of making you feel guilty and responsible for how hard their phobia is for them 😢🙄😬.

I’m sorry this happens to you.  But you are totally valid and worth using the pronouns you want.  Btw if you choose to wear a pronoun pin, people will still ignore it, but they can’t say your pronouns aren’t universally accessible 🙂.

Take care, friend!  💜
Just commenting to say I agree with you and I don’t know why on trans Reddit anybody would be saying it’s unreasonable to be upset at being misgendered. 

Gender neutral pronouns have been around as long as English has and people are constantly inventing more. This is NOT new. 

That argument sounds like the people who call us transtrenders when in reality trans people have been around as long as gender identity has.
[removed]
Yeah! It’s just a word it’s not like it’s a slur it’s just a word!
Huh, I always pronounced them like the 's' in measure, but only in my head. The more you know
Wait then you would pronounce them like he/him?
Sorry I don't speak English natively so I don't understand how would the pronunciation be
Nice
idk, but zhe said it was pronounced like he/him but with a z instead of h
How do you feel comfortable with zhe and not they
Agreed
[removed]
Omg! That's so cool!
As a mod, I agree. Been doing my best to clean up after seeing it first thing in the morning. Was not expecting to be raised by truscum while on vacation.
[removed]
Some people do actually identify with those pronouns because they identify as those things. I have a lovely friend who uses xe/xem and voi/void and though I don’t understand what it means to identify as a celestial/void being I do know that xe is wonderful and deserving of the respect of using whichever label voi prefers at the time.

Yeah, xenogenders are literally just metaphors. In fact cis and binary trans people use metaphors regarding their genders all the time, it’s not that different.
[removed]
[deleted]
I just a meant it was seemed a little strange sorry to offend you
Sorry that’s happening. Your pronouns are valid and you’re valid
Yes it’s literally she/him the full set is she/him/his/herself
[removed]
Thanks for explaining me. I don't believe I still totally get it... but anyway just like before I am no one to decide what pronouns must be or not be used. I want to be refered to as she, if someone wants to be called ""it"" I will use ""it"", for ""they"" people I use ""they"" and so on. It would be very transphobic to do otherwise.
Girl I’m 24. But I am old enough to know that this was not the reality of the queer community at large even 10 years ago. At this point, being able to choose to be queer is annoying and rubs people with no choice but to be queer the wrong way.

Also if you’re so progressive, you wouldn’t shame someone for their age.
[removed]
Makes sense
Obligatory Context:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/pgq1tn/there_are_many_benefits_to_being_a_marine/
probably means they can’t relate to wanting to use them?
For me it is like this

I can understand wanting to be more masculine and wanting to go by masculine pronouns, like he/him.

I can understand wanting to be more feminine and wanting to go by feminine pronouns, like she/her.

And i can understand finding yourself outside the gender binary of masc/fem and therefore wanting to go by neutral pronouns like they/them. 

But what i don’t understand is what makes someone want to specifically use pronouns like zhe/zhim? It obviously is supposed to be something outside the binary, but at that point, why not just use they/them? What is it about neopronouns that are more desireable than using the already established gender neutral pronouns? I get that they are more comfortable, but i don’t understand why. Like for me as a trans-femme, i like using she/her because it appeals to my feminine identity and my desire to be a woman, but i don’t understand what is it that drives NBs who use neopros to use them rather than they/them. Like if you wanted to be outside the binary, surely you would just use the nonbinary pronouns that already exist. 

I would also like to add, i’m not trying to sound like i’m wanting to not use neopronouns, if that’s what you want to go by, that is what i will try to use. I’m just trying to gain an understanding on why you want to use those specifically, and voicing my lack of understanding so i can hopefully be enlightened.
I assume like the french j, or the s in vision :)
[deleted]
The line thing? Super fair. 

I’ve only lived in the US so I can’t compare with anywhere else, but “All people deserve respect (as long as they’re exactly like me and I understand them)” is pretty much the foundation of this country lmao
Honestly no need to apologize. It’s not you’re fault that people are… the way they are.
[removed]
That’s all that a neopronoun is…a gender neutral pronoun that has recently been added to the language.  I’m glad that “iel” is being used!  When I learned French years ago, it didn’t exist, so that’s great 😄
One of the advantages French and Swedish have in this regard is that those languages are dictated by a group. English doesn't have anything group that updates the language so it all has to be done organically over time. On one hand I think it's really cool that we have this explosion of interesting pronouns, and have for a long time, but it's harder for these things to hit the mainstream. I use they/them and even that has caused some discussion, and those have been around since old English!
Yeah. This thread is garbage, I'm cleaning it up.
What WILL be enough then? Zhe/zhim and other neopronouns are already being used by many people, meaning they do have value to multiple people. According to your criteria, they're worthy of being added to the language.

And why, in a trans sub, would anyone be calling not wanting to be misgendered ""demanding compliance""? It's a simple pronoun, not a dictator's new laws being enacted
Words help frame our perceptions and understandings of the world. People often react poorly to feeling like those frameworks are being challenged or that their understanding is imperfect. It’s not good but it is and I think people would do well to reflect on what exactly they’re protecting: Their actual safety or just a feeling of safety.
Pronounced ""zee"" ""zim""
No you replace the h sound with z
Oh that makes so much more sense!
Personally? I don't use Zhe, but to me it'd be because they/them either:

1. Doesn't describe my experience as a trans person.

2. Gets confused for plurality.

3. Isn't something that makes me comfortable.
Okay yeah based
[removed]
Xenogenders don’t mean they identify as that thing though. Xenogenders are literally just metaphors. Nounself neopronouns aren’t always connected to xenogenders either. 

Xenogenders and neopronouns are valid but it’s incorrect to say things like “someone who is catgender identifies as a cat” because that incorrectly represents xenogenders. Otherkin would be identifying as said thing, like identifying as a cat. They could also use nounself neos if they wanted.
Ok then, be bigoted if you want. Throwing your own community under the bus does nothing but make you a bigger target faster.
I know people who use multiple names. Every heard of nicknames? It's not hard.

Also, using that name as your choice is pretty mocking. So I don't think you get my point.
[removed]
[removed]
“I think it’s kinda silly” why the fuck was it necessary to say that?? That is actively disrespectful to anyone who uses neopronouns. It would’ve been SO easy not to say that
Ie we should not ever say he for you, only she, but also never her, just him?
You absolutely don't need to apologize, however a vent post really isn't the place to discuss the validity of using the ""it"" pronoun. You're absolutely entitled to never use that pronoun for people if it's this painful <3
Person. Calm down, you’re the one who said “they/them/theirs is easy considering we already use them but ze/zhim/…zeirs??”. Replace the “they/them/theirs” with “she/her/hers” or “he/him/his” and “ze/zhim/zeirs” with “they/them/theirs”. It’s the same argument people were making a few years ago against non-binary people. And idk how the heck being a white queer person matters in this case, as a trans POC, I don’t see it mattering at all. And calling the person transphobic was uncalled for… especially when they’re defending OP and other neo users, and are trans themself. Take a breath and consider things again.
Wow that is a lot of assumptions. I don’t show up to marches cause my parents would quite literally kill me if they found out. And also, how in the fuck did you misunderstand my comment that badly?

There are so many LGB people who say they deserve rights, but trans people don’t. There are so many binary trans people who say they deserve rights, but non binary people don’t. There are so many non binary people who say they deserve rights, but neopronoun users don’t. My point is that all of these are equally stupid - people will make fun of the LGBT community no matter what, infighting and saying that *some* LGBT people are invalid will never be helpful.
I’m sorry you’ve had shitty experiences with white people, but you shouldn’t generalise because that’s the exact same thing transphobes are doing. If it helps I’m white and go to marches, I stick up for everyone who’s oppressed, of course that doesn’t fix anything but you really shouldn’t generalise, and you’re also being racist which isn’t helping anything
Did I pick the one profession with a massive tumblr thread by accident?
Tbh, that's my assumption. 

I get they/them.  I even quite like she/they.

I have no idea why anyone would want to be called zie/zem or whatever else exists.  
I have no idea why some people who use she/they need to get both of em.  
I don't need to.

It's yet another opportunity to practice 'respect without understanding'.
Not sure what the downvote is for when I’m asking a clarifying question to better understand the speaker to be able to better engage with the speaker. 

If we could understand the lack of understanding, we could address it. Alas, relating and understanding are two different things.
it's for the exact same reason that you use she/her. that's literally the exact reason. because it's what feels correct and affirming and Good. 

there are also binary trans people and cis people who use neopronouns. it's not just nonbinary people, just like there are cis men who use she/her and cis women who use he/him. 

but no, it's literally the same reason why anyone uses any pronoun that they use. because it feels right and comfortable. sometimes that means inventing something new. i had to do that for my gender identity, some people have to use that for pronouns.
This is like my viewpoint exactly
Identity shouldn’t have to be about progression. I’m not trans to be some kind of force for progress, just because it’s what feels right for me and it’s wrong to place that burden on other trans people too.
Yeah, but sucks that there was so much garbage here that I only just saw. Trying to keep a safe space isn't easy, but, y'know, it's important to me that I try.
[removed]
I think it was added last year in the dictionary.
Oh okay, i was more confused about the z sound than the ""ee"", but apparently there's only one z sound in English, like in zoo.
Somehow i though there was other variant but messed up with Spanish z which is pronunced like th im think.
So yeah I was confused of it should be pronunced like zee or like ""thee"" my bad.
Btw as a Spanish speaker, its so hard for us to pronunce differently ""she"" and ""ze"". We only have one sound for that so :(
[removed]
I don’t know why you are explaining xenogenders to me. I was talking about a specific being that uses voi/void as a set of pronouns which voi include with other neopronouns when self labelling. Voi is plural and does not identify as human and collectively choose to identify as a celestial body/void being. Edit to apologize if this seems combative, I appreciate the clarification you are making and I am sure in most instances nounself pronouns are not about being the thing but about associating with aspects of it, however in the specific case I was talking about the being explicitly identifies as being a void being.
[removed]
hi!!! you just replied to a post where OP is using zhis pronouns in real life! so it would be wrong to categorize zhim as “terminally online” ! 

spreading neopronoun hate on a post venting about neopronoun hate is wild
Please don't invite raids from them by linking their sub here <3
Correct
I talked with a friend about it and they said the same thing. 

I still feel horrible for not being able to, like I'm invalidating anyone who feels most comfortable with those neopronouns.
[removed]
Nah, you probably chose it for the benefits
Definitely respect regardless of understanding but it’s also worth attempting to understand. As a binary trans man, I would prefer that people at least try to understand who I am and genuinely see me as a man instead of only changing the words they use. Here’s an article about neopronouns which may help https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/
That's a good way to view it personally I like to try and understand why also makes it easier to respect but I don't need to understand or be able to relate to respect it
I think the downvote is because the asking if it’s struggling to understand how they work in a sentence comes across as condescending because it’s pretty obvious that they work exactly like any other pronoun. It didn’t seem genuine; it seemed like a jibe.
I haven’t downvoted you, that’d be other people
Yeah, but i don’t understand why they make you feel affirming and good. For me what is affirming and good about feminine pronouns are that they make me feel like a woman. That is the understanding i’m after, why they make you feel good.
Mind if I ask what you invented? I'm curious
[removed]
Oui, dans Le Robert il me semble. Je suis contente qu'on ai plus d'options neutres en français; d'autant plus que récemment un.e de mes adelphe as fait son coming out comme étant genderfluid. (iel préfère être référé.e en langage non-genré pour l'instant)
Well, I wouldn't use he or him for example as I don't identify myself with those pronouns, and they don't describe my experience in transition.
Yes in specific cases it’s different, but even in my initial comment I was talking about in general to a person who was confusing two things and also calling neopronouns ridiculous.
[removed]
It’s honestly genuine curiosity. But I can see how one could read it that way.
because they make them feel like their gender? op's pronouns feel good because those pronouns are affirming for zhem, it makes zhem feel like zheir gender, and that's all there is to it. it's literally no different than a binary person using he/him or she/her. i don't see why that's hard to understand lmao?

&#x200B;

edit: blocked because apparently i'm being 'rude' lmao. not responding further to this thread lol
Basically I couldn't find a label that felt like it fit with my spiritual beliefs and how that relates to my gender, so I've been using post-human (the term itself was penned by my favorite musician, actually). It's kind of a disregard towards the human notion of gender and moving past that while also moving somewhat backwards in experiencing gender the way a non-human animal might; that is to say Not Really Experiencing it.

Of course with most people I just say I'm a nonbinary trans man because it's easier to say that as shorthand (and believable since I use he/him) than explaining how my werejaguar and naturism beliefs influence my interaction with gender and presentation and all that 😂 

So yeah. Post-human, and I kind of use that for sexuality, too. I just don't ascribe to any of the general human approaches to it. I am what I am, and that's not as important as what I do.
Oui c'est dans le Robert! Pour une langue particulièrement genrée, je trouve ça même surprenant haha

I didn't entirely understand all of that but I get what you mean  I haven't had much interest in determining my sexuality or where I truly sit on that umbrella or some of the others
I'm not sure what you don't understand tbh
[removed]
I’m falling into the same boat with you with not really being able to conceptualize why someone would feel affirmed with neopronouns. Like cloudself and whatnot is very confusing to me and I’d love to understand them, but anytime you ask someone for an in-depth explanation it seems like all that’s given back is exactly what this other commenter gave. Something vague that’s not very helpful for conceptualizing
[removed]
I feel like there's a precedent set with a gendered set of pronouns or a specifically non-gendered set but with neopronouns there's no basis for those on the outside of the neo pronoun user to understand how that pronoun relates to your gender and how zhey'd like to be perceived. Not that that contributes or detracts to it's validity but it certainly adds a layer of confusion that often leads to the good old human reaction of just giving up.
I think it's like how I don't feel like or really even identify as a human I call myself an alien because of the way most of mankind is I don't use it as my pronouns now imagine if you didn't know what an alien was but still felt that way. Neopronouns are the alien which haven't been named basically I think.
That's not what I said, but transition is a process in which you learn to express yourself, pronouns are one such way to do so.
[removed]
Yourself.

Well gender identity in and of itself is a complicated matter. Some of it is based in biology, some of it based on social identity, some of it based on your upbringing, etc.

Pronouns themselves are interesting because using non-standard pronouns, especially ones that are not in the usual lexicon, can be a way to express yourself in a way that you otherwise couldn't. For example, he/him typically mean masculine, she/her typically mean feminine, and they/them can mean lack of gender or something else to the effect of gender non-conforming.  
Neo-pronouns themselves imply that your gender identity is a known quantity, but one that isn't defined by the use of one of the above pronouns. Now, I don't personally use neo-pronouns myself, but I can understand why they're used; as for me using she/her (or even they/them depending on how I feel) allows me to express my inner gender identity in a way that makes me feel comfortable when I'm referred to using them, that people respect who I am and it reinforces how I feel on the inside.

I won't say that that's true for _everyone_, but it does give an overview of how I personally feel about them. To give a brief overview from before, the use of the pronouns (as an example with she/her over they/them):

1. Describe my experience as a trans person.
  - As in they describe my gender identity in a way that makes sense as to how I identify.
2. Doesn't get confused for some other meaning of my gender identity
  - As in they couldn't be mistaken for plurality, or something else that they/them would indicate that she/her doesn't.
3. These pronouns make me comfortable as who I am.
  - As in I know I'm respected in the gender identity that I am, that people aren't making some sort of assumption or otherwise don't think I'm someone that I'm not.
[removed]
That's a hard question to answer without a lot of time and investment honestly. I'll give a relatively short and overly simplified rundown though:

> how exactly do you define gender/gender identity?

(I consider gender to be gender identity in this context, as it makes it easier)  
Gender identity is an internal sense of self and that's self connection to the reality it perceives around it.

> could you explain how it links to social identity, biology, and upbringing?

I'll preface this by saying that I don't think any one of these 3 things are more important than the other, nor do I think that they're the only things that effect or link to gender identity, nor do I think that these 3 things are prerequisites to be transgender.

- The links to social identity is kinda obvious if you understand what I say in my definition above, but to expand upon it; the way you see and understand yourself, the role you place yourself in society, the role society places you, the places/people/institutions that you identify with, etc. are all ways that it links to a social identity.
- As for biological links, it's hard for me to say directly, as I mostly just listen to those that are smarter than I am, since biology is incredibly complicated! We still don't understand exactly why trans people exist, but if we try to think of how the body is an extension of the self, and gives us the ability to interact and perceive the world in a way that's impossible for the brain to do alone, then it gives us some hints as to what it could mean. Since our sense of self may conflict with the body we perceive ourselves to have, and the hormones and whatnot that effect it, that could be one way biology links to gender identity, though absolutely not the only way.
- Upbringing is interesting, as it's another way to say socialization, as in how we grow up seeing ourselves through the people and institutions that raised us. This can mean that we see ourselves in ways that are detrimental to our own mental health, or in ways that give a unique perspective on the world around us. Our gender identity would then be shaped by not only how we see ourselves through those that raise us, but also through ways we didn't see ourselves through those same people/institutions.

I hope that explains a bit of what I mean, but you could philosophize on and on about links to gender identity, how they work, what they mean, etc. etc. etc. It's a fun thing to think about, but also a bit tiring lol 😅"	xarfae	trans	1540	0.86	2022-09-10 14:58:20
Entertaining, yet a little bit sad...		"It even has a “they/them” singular 😂
Mewtwo said it better anyway.
The circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant, it's what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are
Damn that aged like piss.
When a woman is ""worried"" about other women being uncomfortable in the bathroom when trans women are allowed there but writes a book where two guys brew a potion in the ladies bathroom in broad daylight without anyone questioning it
Makes me sad to think she could have been a big ally. But instead decided to be in opposition. 

If anything, she coulda just shut up and no one would have known. 

*insert star wars meme about bringing balance to the force*
This aged like fucking milk
I had a plaque of this quote above my door when I was little lol
Thou Who shall not be named will be haunted by this quote for eternity


*Now this, brings a smile to my face.*
How ironic, using they/them pronouns
She is basically the world's greatest virtue signaler/biggest piece of shit. Like I've never seen someone spew such bullshit when they clearly do not believe any of the things they say themselves.
I was reading through the HP books with the intention of finding the most trans-friendly quotes. This and the rest of the Goblet of Fire is *full* of them.
😂😂😂
As someone only vaguely familiar with Pokémon (i.e. I know who mewtwo is but have no clue what you're referencing)... what is this referring to?
Or Paarthunax
Yeah, it would have aged wonderfully if she weren't a TERF and there for us trans peeps. I wonder what she thinks of trans men like me, if she thinks so terribly about trans women.
She wrote a whole series that started with a kid that was forced into a closet by terrible relatives that didn't respect them and the story started with the hero coming out of that closet for life. Such a big opportunity wasted by JK being JK.
Yeah, but you forgot to mention: Four males entered that bathroom more than once.

1 & 2) Harry and Ron helping brew the Polyjiuce Potion for a few months (Halloween to December).

3) Lockhart, a grown man, entering the bathroom, forced to enter by Harry and Ron, to only have his memory wiped.

4) Tom Riddle entering the bathroom several times, it's assumed, to open the Chamber of Secrets and end the life of a girl (Moaning Mytle).
Even better, she could have been transmasc herself. Just that she decided that no, she was just a confused woman and so are all other transmascs
In the first Pokémon movie he says ""the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant,  it's what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are"". I think a politician quoted him too. It's both a good line for his arc and for life in general
She thinks trans men are poor, confused women, most often autistic and unable to make decisions.
mostly the terf stance on trans men (at least part of which she'd regurgitated in her ""terf wars"" essay) is ""they're confused lesbians"" (because that's a very feminist take) or ""they're trying to escape womanhood""

which makes sense given their base ideology - man strong and evil oppressor, woman weak and oppressed. basically a way too oversimplified view of the patriarchy.

so when a trans man exists, and you don't want to change that base view to account for the fact people are transgender, you have to find some other explanation for why he transitions, with ""just confused"" and ""escaping womanhood"" obviously fitting the idea of women as weak/oppressed.

incidentally that also shows really well why they hate trans women - if you start out with that base view, you can't understand why anyone would *want* to be a woman, especially compared to being a man - the fact that there's some aspects to gender other than oppression is lost on them.

so because that doesn't seem to make sense - you get wanting to become an oppressor rather than oppressed, but why would you want the opposite? - the most obvious explanation is that a trans woman is still a man doing oppression, but in a different way, hence the panic around bathrooms n stuff.
Damn, I totally forgot about numbers 3 and 4
Mewtwo based
Wow that's really cool I like that
thats a great quote omg
""I'm a feminist, but also, women are confused and unable to make their own decisions"" - terfs, somehow
Hey I'm a poor confused woman that's autistic and unable to make decisions!

Wait...

I'm transfem
Wow. Although I have autism, I can make a clear-headed decision, even if I tend to hesitate into inactivity due to my anxiety. I've never wanted boobs since I developed them since age nine, and was told my hatred of them was normal (in terms of a cis person understanding the distress and discomfort I feel having breasts), so I never told anyone, as I thought it was something everyone, who had boobs, felt. However, according to JK Rowling, I'm just a ""poor, confused autistic woman who can't make a decision."""	11srlol	trans	1419	0.99	2023-03-16 11:39:43
I am Russian trans woman and I am sorry.	"Dear Ukrainian trans\*persons,  


I am really sorry for you experiencing all of this. It is really painful to be invaded by one of the most transphobic countries in the world, which verbally/non-verbally supports nearly all far-right parties movements in Europe and United States. I am deeply ashamed by the behaviour of my own country right now and try to do all of my best to somehow prevent it. Sadly, I can't go really far, because in Russia you can go to jail for your political position, and for me, trans woman, jail literally means suicide.  


Please, remember, that you are not alone. Russian state is an enormous machine of persecution, which targets nearly every vulnerable group, so you can be sure, that Russian transgender community, which is attacked by Russian media and officials almost on daily basis, is with you. Yes, there are some of us (transgender persons), who support Putin and Russian military invasion, but this is a small and miserable group.  


Sorry for all of that. You will be right for not forgiving us,

Adelaide."	"Hey I’m an Australian but it’s nothing on you

Your pretty much on our side stuck in a hostile environment 

But listen sweetheart it’s nothing on you❤️ just shitty politics 

I say this about every Russian person right now

The Russian people are not the problem 

It’s the government, the soilders are just following orders as well but it’s not likey they can disobey orders (but still doesn’t disregard them as the enemy)

But Cliff notes are: don’t be ashamed, this isn’t your fault and is way too far out of your hands

Edit: also like your name :) very aussie
You are not to blame, the actions of putin doesn’t reflect on the people who lead the act. I understand your perspective being a transwoman in Russia, it is life or death. 

You do what you can to survive and never bend your own principles, a few bad eggs doesn’t make all Russian people bad. 

Wishing you the best of luck for the future, stay safe and look after yourself.

Misaki
When those in power don't want you to exist, existing is a revolutionary act. You do what you have to do to keep existing.
I am a Russian trans woman too and I absolutely hate that tyrannical regime. I am currently living in Poland and I am so scared they going to deport me and my family because of one crazy old fool.
Blame *Russia*, not *Russians*, I say. The people shouldn't have to apologize; it's the establisment that should. That same establishment has, and still continues, to subject Russia's people to unspeakable atrocities. Now it's spreading beyond the borders, but it's sadly nothing new... 😥
Not Ukranian but I’m glad to see this. Thank you.
спасибо за слова, Аделаида. вам тоже, ребята, желаю удачи и силы в этом пиздеце
Yk its kinda funny, in my last week of my worlds issues class i learned about this whole thing at that high school principals went down to classrooms and ""informed"" the students that russia wasn't invading... the dipshits in the russian army were posting pictures of themselves, on Facebook, of them being in the Ukraine.
I couldn’t ever blame you for your countries mistakes, how could i blame you who is just trying to live in a country that discriminates against you. I hope things go well for you.
You are what's good in that country. Thank you for your support, even in just words alone.
This is a very kind and sweet gesture on your behalf. I’m sorry trans individuals have to suffer so much in general in russia. I do hope that this conflict resolves quickly and with minimal souls lost. Please be safe and your heartfelt appology I’m sure is greatly appreciated.
I am from Belarus. But wanted to add my sympathies for Ukrainian people. Really sorry about what happened today(( OP, I understand you completely and I think, you have nothing to apologize for. That wasn't your fault.
Hey sis, I’m sorry you have to live in that shithole. Fuck Russia and fuck Putin. He’s probably out here sucking and gagging on some girl dick and hates himself for it.
Don’t be too hard on yourself. Governmental bodies have often misrepresented the populous. War is a horrid beast that I believe should remain a relic of the past, but that doesn’t stop the US from getting involved in wars, and won’t stop us now.
Best of luck to you, Adelaide. And to all our siblings in Ukraine. May you find safety and security.
With everything going on with Russia and all I wasn’t able to sleep last night and I am all the way in the US
All the best for the people of Ukraine, and I (a transman living in China), thank you for posting this. What you’ve done is a truly sweet and polite gesture and you are not to blame for the horrible decisions one evil man can make! 

To quote one of the other comments, “existing is an act of revolution” you are not alone in this. Stay safe!
no need to be sorry nothing is your fault, you are not your government and you cant do anything. *especially* in Russia.
Hey, definitely not your fault, but I'm sure your support is very appreciated :) 

For those interested, there are a bunch of platforms to donate money for Ukraine, if you can afford it
This is very sweet and kind of you.. Please do not blame yourself for the government’s decisions. It’s not as though you decided or wanted this. Please take care of yourself and have a wonderful day love
I'm willing to believe most Russians are against this war. I have heard unsubstantiated reports that some Russian soldiers deserted when the order came in. I hope this is true.
American here, and agree with /u/not_a_pancake6291.  We know you're living under a villain straight out of a Bond movie...an ex-spy who took over a country with dreams of making the west feel his humiliation at his country collapsing first at the end of the cold war.

Stay safe, *естра*...I don't blame you at all, it's not like you're the one rigging elections and assassinating politicians who oppose him, y'know?  I can only hope that my country, and its allies, step up to defend Ukraine in ways you can't without bringing down the wrath of an oppressive monster who already hates you just for existing.

The same goes for every trans person in Ukraine...I cannot and will not blame you for looking out for your own survival as priority number one...your military is fighting a good fight, but I don't see them winning without the intervention of allies, purely on the numbers game.
I don't think you have to apologize for something that is immensely out of your control but I'm sure many people would appreciate the sentiments. You make sure you stay strong and safe in your country because I know there are laws that refute your existence there.
Yes, it’s been posted by many others, but please don’t feel that you owe anyone an apology.  The most horrible places are full of some of the most wonderful people.  Love to you from America.
Ukranian here, first of all, it's not your fault, the government is always fucked. Thank you for your support, I hope you people in Russia are doing well too.<3 🇺🇦♥️🇷🇺
One of the most helpful things about the Internet is that words like these can travel over enemy lines.  I'm so sorry for what you're going through and as everyone else I agree that you are not to blame.

To be true, I've shame enough for my own country as well.  There seems to be a lot of it to go around these sad days.
You didn't do anything wrong. The Russian government did. The people shouldn't have to apologize for the wrongdoings of their government nor ancestors.
I’m living in the US, with my grandmother, cousins and aunt and uncle in Ukraine. My grandmother is leaving Мариуполь on Saturday to go to western Ukraine. My cousin is driving to Poland as I’m writing this. I have been crying non stop  and haven’t been able to eat. All I want to do is go be there and hug all of you and help as many people as I can. I hope you NEVER apologize again for something that this psychopath is doing. I want to help you escape. I want you to get out of there. Как я могу тебе помочь??? Скажи мне
As an American,

You are not at fault for the law of your home. You are an ally and have my full support. I wish that you won’t have to live in an environment where you hide your true self, you deserve to live happily as who you are.

Much love to you hun. my wife's grandfather was ukrainian so we are watching in horror hoping that her extended family are safe.

i kind of feel the same way as an american. so many countries are negatively affected by things my country did and still continues to do. i've had people actually mad at me unfortunately, even though i disagree with a lot of america's values and actions. what's worse is i didn't know these things until they were brought to my attention. however, i live in a country where i'm more free to be myself, yet i still can't do anything to help. my point is that you're in a worse off position than me and i can already do practically nothing to help so don't worry. don't feel guilty <3
Much love Adelaide!! Please please keep yourself safe❤
You have such a big heart for making this post. Let's be nice to everyone. We are all humans. Our race, gender identity etc is not a requirement to be simply nice. Be safe everyone.
Hey, it's not your fault, you're a very sweet person and you're not the one who should be apologizing at all.
So heartbreaking to read this as I'm sure if you had any say in things we wouldn't be talking about an invasion. It's tragic that only the people who didn't consent to this war will ever feel any sense of responsibility for it. I hope you are taking pride in doing what you can to help in such challenging circumstances.
Your nationality has nothing on you, to me I all I see is human being no matter who you are or where you come from your just human and something about.the way you wrote this just makes me wanna shake your hand and hug you at the same time, I wish you well and try not to be too hard on yourself, Stay strong and message if you need me 😉✌️🤘
You can’t take on the blame for the entire crap political climate. Stay safe friend.
it’s okay honey, it’s not Russia, it’s scum politics and a fucking dictator being a piece of shit, Russians are not to blame
thank you, Adelaide<3
i'm American so i can not speak for the trans people in ukraine, but in my eyes its not your fault, and you have nothing to be sorry for.
All my love to you ❤️

i am russian too and it disgusts me what government is doing. this is a fucking shame on all of russia and i don't want people to remember my country for this war. i have friends and and family here as well and each night i hope they'll be alright. i myself don't know what future will bring and will i be ok. this is nothing to blame on you, fuck putin and other high-ups. i hope they get what they deserve
*hugs*
I am sorry, I am not answering, I have problems with concentration and my mental state today, so, sadly, there is hardly anything I can do :(
I'm not too familiar with russian politics so I wanted to ask by saying ""jail literally means suicide"" do you mean they just murder trans people there or more as a way of saying jail is awful for trans individuals?

There's no need to be sorry, to be ashamed of the fact that some dickhead happened to be born in the same place as you. That's just RNG stuff, you know.

I'm from Lublin, Poland, and there's a member of parliament, and now minister of education and science, from there too, that's dumb, rude, misogynist and obsessed with fighting „rainbow plague” (talking about Przemysław Czarnek). I used to be ashamed that he comes from the same place as I am, but that's not really my fault, right? Shitty people happen everywhere.

I don't know how all of this will end, but for now I know that Ukrainians are tough and won't let beat them easily. And I don't think war is supported by many of your compatriots. Maybe it'll end in backlash and collapse of Putin's regime, who knows?
> If I have one message to give to the secular American people, it’s that the world is not divided into countries. The world is not divided between East and West. You are American, I am Iranian, we don’t know each other, but we talk together and we understand each other perfectly. The difference between you and your government is much bigger than the difference between you and me. And the difference between me and my government is much bigger than the difference between me and you. And our governments are very much the same...

I am a fully transitioned trans woman living in Amsterdam. I live my best life right now.   
Recently I helped [a trans girl age 21 from Prague](https://i.imgur.com/xQ3yjuP.jpg) escape bad parents, she lives with me for two years, she got hormones, she got GRS and is functionally all girl now. She recently moved in with her (rich) boyfriend in Almere. I'd make the same offer to any trans girls that want OUT of Russia, Ukraine, [et.al](https://et.al). right NOW. I am not rich, so you have to make your way here. I can sponsor your longterm stay.  You can work, study, party and find yourself a BF (or GF) here. I can give you shelter and a home for a few years.
Thank you! <3  


Well, sadly, it is partially our fault, because trans citizens are also citizens of Russia, and I think that silence from Russian transgender community is inappropriate.
Exactly and very well stated. It is revolutionary and extremly brave to exist in a world like theirs.
Yes, I feel you, this is absolutely disgusting. I hope that you won't face any problems because of that :<

Oh honey. That's Russia; there's no protections for trans people at all. If the state won't kill you, other prisoners will.
Get out of our community you transphobe garbage.

I am sorry, but I think should solve now some bigger problems (like with suicidal ideation) for now. I lived in Netherlands for one year
What?

Not really, your community under a complete dictatorship and being under a dictatorship there’s not much anyone can do for anyones rights

It’s a tricky subject because yes I firmly believe in the quote “for evil to rule, good men(people)must do nothing” 

But facts are under a dictatorship pressure must come from the outside 

But I think I speak for a lot of the trans community that has half a brain cell

We feel sorry for Russian trans people too, just like how we feel sorry for all Russian people stuck in this conflict they disagree with
It is not inappropriate sweetie. Trans people are oppressed and treated unfairly already I could only imagine the horrors you would all face if you vocally opposed Putins regime. 

All of your lives are vary important and it is better to be safe then suffer at the ignorance of the masses for a cause that No one could stop.
in a place with more free speech, speaking up would be useful. but here speaking up would put you all in such immense danger. it’s natural to avoid that, we don’t fault you for that.
Hey friend, you’re living in a country that pretends there aren’t even gay people in entire states. You’re living under an autocrat who poisons and defenestrates people with regularity. You are living under possibly the most infamous living dictator, the man looking to create a new Axis of Evil with China, who is seeking his own Lebensraum, and who displays his strength by riding horses shirtless—because all of the most horrifying evils in the world are also, somehow, utterly ridiculous, which makes them no less horrifying.

This is not your fault. Just living as yourself is living in opposition to Putin. We know that there are a LOT of Russians who really do not want this, and can’t do much on account of the rabid dog who has an iron grip on the country. It’s not your fault.

You are not alone, either. You are far from the only country in the world with imperialist leaders seeking war and violence for personal gain. I’m American, and I know a thing or two about that. I protest, and I vote, and that’s all I can realistically do if I don’t want to end up in prison—and in America, the prisoner capital of the world, I might end up in prison for doing those things anyway. Unfortunately, the world is not so simple as the movies, and the good guys—when there even are good guys—don’t always win.

Be safe. Take care of yourself and those close to you. You already have a target on your back thanks to the bigot in the secret mansion, so please please look out for yourself first before trying to go against Putin. You are loved. Be safe.

Sad story :(	I work at a grocery store and today something broke my heart.  A mom, her older daughter, and a little boy came into the line. I was bagging for them and making light conversation. It was fine until she rubbed the boys head and said “your such a pretty girl” The kid then said, “Mom I’m not a girl I’m a boy.” The mom then said, “and i thought i was a dog when i was a kid.” Then she looks at me and says she thinks she is in the wrong body give me a break.” The daughter got visibly mad and the boy seemed upset. I didn’t have anything to say to that and for the rest of the time. I just bagged her groceries and left. Hurt my heart :(	"Probably rubbed the boys head just to say that, get the reaction, and try to push the ideas onto you aswell or get approval for their bad behavior
I'm rooting for our little dude from the grocery store. Hopefully the parent can learn to grow tf up and learn some fucking respect. People who act like this do not deserve to have children. Holy shit..
That's horrible, and I'm sick to death of transphobes doing that stupid ""When I was a kid I wanted to be a T-rex!"" bullshit, no you didn't, how fucking rude and condescending do you have to be? You're already saying you don't love him for who he is and that's horrible enough. I just hope his sister is supportive.
Ugh... boo 🙁
What a witch😡

That kid, Ugh I feel so bad for him
My face can't lie. If I'm at work I can't really rock the boat, but my face gives me away. Thankfully I'm self employed and don't give a fuck what comes out of my mouth.
jesus fucking christ that lady

I relate to the boy
\*Already high levels of anger increase\*

People like this mother are why you should have to take courses to be a parent.
poor guy. I hope he was a supportive environment with friends or at school :(
Ouch.
""Don't sell yourself short. *I* think you're a dog *now*.""
She didn't think she was a dog, she pretended to be a dog. That's not at all the same.

Wish some of the commenters would have emailed the judge in the family court who took my daughter from me and gave her to my parents for them raising ""concerns about my gender transition"" and that I have ""mental health issues"" and ""addiction to alcohol"" (both preceding statements are prior to hrt and hearsay in any case since the alcohol and drug specialist told me that I don't have any issues and they stemmed from external sources if I did have any (my parents and society)
Hopefully his sister will stand up for him.
Oh dear. Poor kids. Sorry you had to experience that.
This hurts my heart but I also understand the position you were in as an employee. I hope I never witness something like this, but if I happen to be a customer at the time I pledge to be a loudmouth so a store employee does not have to risk their job.
Pain.
Poor kid
That Mom is a shitty mom
People like this dont deserve children wtf, i hope the boy will be okay and his mom grows some common sense.
[Sasha] Poor little guy, I hope his mom changes for the better before he hits puberty or that he at least doesn't get stuck in a shit living situation till his 20's like has happened with us.
i feel so bad for him, ive had family members who say im a such a pretty girl and it breaks my heart this is happening to a little kid

“And when I was a kid I wanted to be kind, but people like you showed me kindness doesn’t exist. Thanks for being an abuser mam. Wouldn’t want your kids to grow up in a welcoming world wouldn’t we?” *smile and let her bag her shit alone*

You don’t have to subject yourself to abuse. You’re too valuable for that. Stay strong 💕
We have a 14 year old boy who wants to be a girl but her parents can't pay for her clothes so my GF and I are helping her
That's when you look at the boy and say ""Well, I think you're a handsome young man."" or something like that. You're not having a conflict with the parents, you aren't doing anything wrong, and the boy gets some validation after the horrible thing his mother said.

And in my mind I would be thinking that the mom is a very handsome b!+¢h.
That’s pretty much how my mom treats me, it’s a little less childish, except I’m 18. 

She insists that I’m too immature to know who I am, and that because I’ve had a lot of identity revaluations in the past 3 year that I’m being influenced. 

The thing is it wasn’t until I got my first boyfriend that I began developing a sense of self outside of her own projections. 

Passive aggressive parental abuse is the worst, except possibly physical abuse which she also partakes in.

Basically I feel for this kid and hopes he has a ally in his older sister and gets away from his bitch of a mom.
""Maybe you were right as a kid, because you sure are acting like a bitch right now""

but I also don't fear getting fired for talking shit to asshole customers
I’d have bitched her out but I doubt she would hav said that to me
Had I been in your shoes, I would’ve made peace with losing that job and let that transphobe fucking hear it
why do people have to be like that :(
Oh for sure. I hate that people do this with shit they know should be wrong. If the wrong person nods and says “yeah I agree” they redeem it as a good behavior ™
no cuz the more masc i look or talk about my gender the more my mom says im her pretty little daughter
and even if they did, it's so stupid to equate wanting to be an animal with being trans
Well that's pretty rude to witches.
parenting licenses must be a thing.
*standing applause*
Burn.
she's a furry /hj
you insult dogs with your comparison.

She's just an inflamed asshole and a bad parent.
Yes we do in America :/
Awww🥺
OP should've done the opposite and just shook their head. I'd do that by accident tbh
That's just going along with my point
Exactly
As a trans witch, I agree lol
Yes, love it. Let’s let a governing body determine who is allowed to reproduce. What could possibly go wrong!
Already told us she is starting to grow her hair
If you work in an environment like that and you react negatively to a customer who is definitely being transphobic to their children and you are the “basic employee” trying to correct their morals you can sometimes get in trouble for doing the right thing, sadly. The customer is always right, and if you involve yourself in any way personally you can get hurt. 

I don’t blame OP for how they responded. Working in grocery stores sucked ass and you get 10 of these gross opinionated people in a day, whether it’s saying their loud aggressive chihuahua is a trained service dog or a parent clearly verbally abusing their kid. Sadly this one just struck home. Yeah you can shake your head, or if it gets bad enough definitely get a manager over. But sometimes it’s better to just avoid the conflict and when you can’t get involved it sucks even more like this. Doing anything negative would have probably ended badly by how this mother sounded.

Edit: I’m an ex employee from a big grocery store chain and I don’t miss it

Also I’m so sorry I know you’re not blaming OP and I got a bit wordy there, I wish it was easier to defend people and not risk your job or personal livelihood.
yeah, thats what i meant dfhfjs
Transwitchion :0
If you're not gonna love the kid or take care of it then don't frakking have it. My point is there should be some standard for being able to be considered ""able to raise a child competently"" not just the current ""ah shit I had a pelvic sneeze, guess we gonna have a kid""
I don't blame OP either and it probably came out wrong the way I said it, sorry. My GM usually protects the employees tho which is apparently rare but if some loud mouth is being a dick she usually shuts them down by giving them free food just to get them out or telling them off.
LMAO
amazing lmao
Oh no it’s okay!! I’m sorry if I responded a bit bitey, I’m glad she protects her employees though, not enough do that."	t95d9k	trans	1386	0.96	2022-03-08 01:43:05
I’m a nanny and I had a bit of a sad story from a kid (5) I was watching today. He just wanted to have fun and express himself.	"We were watching tv and he asked if I could put his favorite show on for him. I asked him what it was, he said Blippi and the he said he wasn’t actually allowed to watch it anymore because he (the kid) did something bad because of Blippi. I told him that I couldn’t let him watch it then if his parents didn’t let him. 

I asked him what he did to get in trouble and he said that blippi said it was ok to dress how you want, whether that was a girl or boy. He then dressed up like a girl and showed his dad. His dad got mad and told him to never do it again and that he shouldn’t do any girl stuff. The poor kid was scared to even have a glittery sticker on him because he’d seem girly…. The sticker was a tree. It’s so sad that his parents can’t just let him play with stuff regardless of if it’s “girly” or “boyish.” Just let kids be kids."	"When I worked in childcare and I had a dad scream at me because his son had an Elsa dress on, he was wearing the dress because he could put it on and off himself, the child even said something along the lines of ‘I don’t like Frozen but I like that I can dress myself without help’. Weather it’s expressing yourself or just wanting some independence parents need to realise that there child isn’t going to be who they want, but that child is going to be there own person.
It's funny when TV shows are more human than the actual parents. One day child you will be allowed to shine.
Reminds me of the one time I ""presented"" girly as a Kid (5-6 at that time cant really remember), I just thought it was so much fun to wear my looooong T-Shirt like a dress. The reactions from literally everyone (who existed in my world back then) had a huge part in shoving me in the closet for the next 25years. 

Sad story, Hope one day Kids can just explore without being judged.
Aww poor kid.
All I know is that the princess dresses are always very popular with the boys at the daycare but did ‘all’ of them grow up to be trans because of that? Kids don’t see the boundaries and just want to try something different. It’s unbelievable that these strange parents go crazy about a tv show or their children dressing up from the dressing up box because they think their child might suddenly decide they are trans because of it. It’s obviously something deeper than that and not seeing a tv show won’t change anything. My parents were quite the opposite. I went to the beach in my sisters bathing suit when I was about 6 and my parents didn’t seem to care….that was the 70s.
this is the ridiculous shit they’re talking about when they say “lIbErAl MeDiA iS tUrNinG oUr KiDs TrAnS”— a show saying something this innocent and benign 🙄
This so so fucking sad. Their life will probably be so fucking hard with shit parents like those.
Blipi is one of those creators where they sound the way they sound because they are talking to kids, but somehow is watchable by an adult because Blipi isn’t being obnoxious. Sucks that happened.
Not letting kids be kids is bad enough, but that kid could be trans and then the parents reaction is forcing them to be something they're not and into a life of hardship, doubt, guilt, anxiety and depression that could easily end up killing them.

When will people stop being scared of trans kids?
Conservative parents be like:
Let kids be kids, stop indoctrinating them!

The second kids be kids:
BAN IT!! NO CHILD OF MINE WILL BE DOING THAT SHIT!!!
Well that's fucking sad. I relate.
Ugh, sadly, I can relate to that story 😢
This kind of shit locked me in the closet until I was 49!
Welcome to my childhood however it wasn't my dad but a neighbors dad.
My son liked princess dresses as a preschooler. Would usually have one on when I went to get him from preschool. We bought some for his cousins for Christmas. He was upset because he wanted one too. My mom proceeded to sit him on her lap and explain why boys can’t wear princess dresses. I then proceeded to tell her if he wanted to wear princess dresses with size 13 pumps when he grew up it was fine by me! We did get him a princess dress, he eventually lost interest as he got older.
a kid that i used to somewhat babysit LOVES Blippi. i dont watch unless im hanging out with him but his mom is super lgbtq+ supportive. not sure how she figured out that i use he/him pronouns but she has never once misgendered me and treats me as one of her own kids. and as such, her son, one of my favorite little gremlins sees me as one of his older brothers. they have an older brother/son who has the same name as myself, so ig it isnt too difficult for them but at the same time with me having spent the majority of my life living and presenting as female and just recently going on t, loads of ppl have misgendered me. (all fully unintentional since they only hear my voice and not see me, i work at a mcdonalds ;)
Poor baby 😥
My parents would've yelled, grounded, and then insult me if I did that.
This was my childhood as a trans woman. I was just talking about it to my boyfriend this morning when I woke up . I wish I had a better child hood. I feel almost all of my trauma comes from my family
Reminds me of my childhood. Anytime I tried to present masculine, I got ridiculed and forced to go back into the closet. Why can’t parents love their kids unconditionally? Sure they say they do but it’s very obvious that their love has conditions.
My life.
This is so sad 😔
Aww poor kid, Blippi is ace, one of my kids watches him, some people are just horrible
If I became a father who could t be supportive of his children, I’d give up my dad card. I wish that child grows up to love themselves whatever they choose.
I did babysitting (I’m a teen, but I still babysat lol) and I had this one kid who was a little boy (at least at birth) he was 8 and I’m 14. He asked me a question, and he said “do you know why my mommy doesn’t let me watch the princes movies?” And I said “oh.. I’m not sure buddy.. :(“ and he tells me “well, one time we went to Disneyland and there was a place where you can become a princess and I got my sister to take me while my mommy and daddy were getting food and when they found out they got really mad…” and I was so sad I wanted to cry but then he continues “Which princess is your favourite princess?” And I said “oh they’re all very lovely, it’s hard to decide” (in case I didn’t choose his and made him sad) then he says “I really like Belle because she’s so pretty! Do you think I can be like her?” And I said “You can be like whoever you want to be, kid! Your parents may not like it, but whenever you can get the chance, you should dress the way you’d like and be who you are! :]” he says “I guess so but my mommy and daddy will never let me..” and I say “you won’t have to live with them forever! I know it may be hard to wait so long, but once you’re out of there, you can be free to dress the way you want! Nobody can force you to not dress like belle when that day comes!” He then asks me “how much longer is that day? O:” and I say “you’ll be 18 when that time comes, since you’re 8 that’ll be just 10 more years!” He says “oh but I’m actually turning 9 in a few months so that means it’s actually 9 years, right?” And I say “oh! Then yes! 9 years!!” He starts getting really excited, his parents won’t come until midnight so he says “while my parents are gone, please just this once will you let me do it right now?” And I was thinking about it, I thought “hmm the parents will be mad.. but the kid really wants to be himself and this will be probably his only chance for a long time…” so I said “alright.. just don’t mention it to your parents otherwise they’ll be mad at the both of us 😂” and he was like “yayy!!! Thank youuu!” And using his sisters old clothes (because she was 18 already I think but idk where she was) we played princess dress up! I put away the clothes nicely and hopefully made them look untouched and put the kid to bed before his parents got home. I probably made some bad decisions there but I just felt bad for the kid..
And they say we’re “groomers”, & that gender affirming care is “child abuse”. Hard to get more “groomer-y” than gender shaming & punishment for expressions of individuality. Not allowing your child to explore their personality/gender & organically discover their true nature… because of the parent’s own prejudice & fear. THAT is child abuse. Poor kid is in for a rough go. Why does this culture “shame” people for just being themselves? Horrible.
educate him about how UNIMPORTANT gender norms are. they have no place in society. this boils my blood. new school maybe?
I'm almost 24 and my parents still don't accept that. 😔
I'm 26 and my mom is still disappointed when I dress in male clothes 😂 
Idc tho and I will never come out until I can live on my own away from them so she'll just have to deal with it since it makes the dysphoria a little bit less *shrug*
It’s was sad. I just let him watch it.
Agreed
>Sad story, Hope one day Kids can just explore without being judged.

right?? they bitch about teenagers “rushing into shit” and wanting to de-transition, yet they also won’t let these poor kids experiment with *anything* to even see how they feel about it first!
Yea I felt bad, because I’m not saying kid is trans but he got really upset when he told me about how he just thought it’d be nice to show his dad he could be pretty in make up and girl stuff. Then he said he didn’t mean it and that I didn’t need to tell his parents.
Well men in the 50s frequently wore full body bathing suits too. It's something they were already used to from when they were growing up.
>not seeing a tv show won’t change anything

absolutely! i grew up in the 90s and had no idea what transitioning even was and didn’t know anyone that was trans (that i was aware of, at least)

it didn’t stop me from crying hysterically when i started puberty and my mother told me it was time i started wearing a bra. i remember reading *Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret* and all these years later, pretty much the only thing i remember about the book was being completely *baffled* by the scenes where she discussed how her and her other female friends wanted larger breasts, and they did the arm exercises while saying “I must, I must, I must increase my bust!” i remember thinking “why would they want that? why don’t *i* want that? what’s wrong with me?”
Was expecting some horrible comment that got heavily downvoted because your comment was collapsed. Wtf Reddit?
Oh it’s the worst . I had parents like that AS A TRANS WOMAN. I pray for this child
Parents projecting their own insecurities on their children... smh
See that’s so dumb, I hope your parents stood up for you
Right! Just let kids be kids. It doesn’t necessarily MEAN “anything”. But, it just MIGHT mean EVERYTHING.

Don’t let your own fears repress your children & stifle their growth! 🙏🥺
I'm 57 and my dad didn't misgender me for the first time this week, though not to my face. On the phone to my sister. She told me about it.
Damn, that’s rough. My only advice is to go no contact when you can and try to repair that damage, I was lucky that only my dad was like that.
Maybe not helpful but playing fem characters in a game and dressing them up nice can help me
Good on you. At least this kid can see one adult who doesn’t shame him for self-expression, and that can make a huge difference. I hope you don’t get into any problems from the parents.
These same parents will throw a fit if the child comes out at 15 because ""There weren't any signs! This is so sudden!"" Dumbass, you *taught* him when he was five that you weren't a safe person to express those signs to!
I remember wearing some eye shadow and women’s clothes to work, after college, at a sub shop.  

I remember my girl co-workers talking to each other, then laughing to each other.  They asked me if I was in theatre.  

It still hurts.
My parents we’re just very progressive and liberal. My older sister wanted a little sister that day so I obliged her request.
I have heard of “where are you god, it’s me Margret” sounds like it was written by someone who was a teenager the 50s. 🙄 

hope you are doing well now. 

In spite of my borrowed swimming costume escapades and some fondly remembered secretive experimentation in my early teens I didn’t feel it necessary to transition it clearly wasn’t my destiny. I do view trans people as their trans identity though.
So this is why this happens? Thanks! TIL
I mean when I came out a couple years ago the there was no signs comment happened and I was like.... really?! Ive been processing stuff in my head pointing out all the signs to myself. 🤔

It happened when they weren't there and at his house, I guess he didnt find need to snitch on me, but I am almost 100% certain my dad would gave agreed with him, but idk I repressed memories of him after he passed away, infact my oldest sister and i had a talk and i thanked her for standing up to him for me when i was younger and she said she had hoped I wouldn't remember cause he wasn't a good person, and my mom 1000000% would have stood up for me. 

When I told my mom I talked to her about moment's that I remember and that she didnt that stood out to me but she supports me. Funny thing is I talked to my wife and she was not surprised when I came out and then i tell her stories and she goes, ""how did you not know?""
Ngl that’s even better. It means he accepts your pronouns enough to use them where you may not hear about it not just as a performance for you
Tbh it's the reason I always play male characters yeah, if I can't be my true self yet irl at least I can be it in my games 😄
Yea, they give him all kinds of fake guns and teach him to play war. Then the second he wanted to do anything seen as girly he gets in trouble
yep. or they think people coming out at 40 who “never showed signs before” are just attention-seeking or something
That is so unbelievably cute
OMG cuuuute💞
you’re actually 100% correct. it was published in 1970 and written by Judy Blume, who was born in 1938 (so she was 13 in 1951). it’s a novel for middle-school-aged kids (those just coming into puberty, tweens basically). she’s written a lot of popular books and many of my peers at that age (those who enjoyed reading outside of school requirements, at least) knew of and enjoyed her books (for context, this was the late 90s/very early 00s). if you look her up, you may recognize the titles of some of her other novels.

and don’t get me wrong, i wasn’t criticizing the book. it has been many, many years since i read it, but i don’t remember disliking it at all. i just remember being so confused about that aspect of the protagonist’s (Margaret’s) narrative. apparently it is a common experience among cis girls to *want* their breasts to come in… but obviously i wasn’t cis, so that kinda explains it, lmao. i just didn’t know it yet.
> i tell her stories, and she goes, ""How did you not know?""

Sometimes, we don't have the knowledge to pull on those threads and explore. If I knew what trans people were at 15, I probably would have explored why I wore one of my mom's bras all day with rolled up socks in it under my shirt for a whole day and it felt right. Instead, I didn't come until I was 21/22
Yeah thats the thing about my dad. He has never been anything but verbally abusive to me my whole life. Never a positive word, everything always a criticism, any ideas torn down or insulted, never a compliment, only insults, Never a ""that was good,"" only ""you're stupid"" or ""it's your fault"" even for things I had nothing to do with.

Over the years though I WOULD occasionally hear that he said something positive about me to OTHERS.

He has serious issues about that that go way beyond me being trans. I had to learn to accept decades ago that I would never get ANYTHING but abusive and critical language from him and it's not about me, it's about him.
Also if you can change your pronouns online, my PFP is my transition goal, I’ve done the same with Discord and my pronouns here are She/her
That is... so fucked up... (fake gun comment)

It's wonderful that you let him watch it. You're a light in the darkness. (first comment)
The upbringing of basically all trans feminine people.
I’m sorry he’s like that. It sucks.
Thats how my dad is too, it was just me and him after my parents broke up when I was 12, and we lived (in a one bed flat where I lived in the front room so I had literally zero privacy) and worked together until I was 21.
Only just got my own place a few months ago and cut him out of my life, seems to have helped but idk.
I know how you feel :(
Sorry to hear that
Yeah same! Usually in the trans subs I have my pronouns in my flair and on discord I have them in my profile as well (and in my nickname as well until people are used to it). Since I changed them the people I hang out with online have been really respectful of them. Even tho my voice sounds nowhere near masculine but no one has misgendered me after I correct them once. I'm really glad about that 😅 
I should probably try some voice training at some point tho....since wait times here to even get hormones are years unfortunately..
I’d let my kids watch blippi, I’ve never censored them on what they want to wear and I will never stop them from expressing their true selves.  

As a trans parent, I feel for this child.  It’s like my upbringing where I was kept in the closet thru parental shame.  

We do not let them have toy weapons.  That’s our line, it’s important that our kids don’t associate toy and weapon together. Seems like a better future.

I hope you get to keep watching this child, sounds like they will need supportive person like you as they get older."	120w5do	trans	1376	0.99	2023-03-24 19:53:25
Why do people use our suicide rates as an argument against us ?	"I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve seen people use this as a ‘tool’ for argument. Do they not understand that it’s people like them that are CAUSING members of our community to get to that point ? Tell us we’re freaks for living authentically more so than our ancestors and then point fingers when they see the deep sadness that most of us go through as a result. 
It’s victim-blaming mentality. 

FFS its not hard to live and let live and I wish these people would learn to stop spewing hate or just become a part of the history that didn’t."	"The thing that bothers me too is when transphobes say “can’t we find a middle ground?”. The middle ground is minding your damn business!!
“People shouldn’t be trans because we’ll harass them until they kill themselves. Why would you make us do that to you by being yourselves?”
It's bullshit too. The 41% statistic is how many trans people have attempted in their lives.

Yeah, I used to be suicidal. Then I transitioned, *and now I'm fine.* Transition *fixed it.*
Because they are evil, stupid, or ignorant. Sometimes a combination of the 3.
They don't use it as an argument.  They use it to mock us and to tell us they're aware of how many of us they are trying to kill.  They know the figure only applies to transgender people who aren't being treated.  


It's not an argument. It's a confession of genocide.
People like to use results based analysis for every thing and don't like to think critically. A result of being trans is higher suicide there for trans bad. You see it in a lot of things
I think the arguement they are trying to make is that we're clearly mentally ill given suicide rates and therefore not really trans. It's not a good argument but it's the kind that can be used to convince people who see a stat and don't look deeper (and feeds into already existing abeism around mental illness). Of course if you look deeper I beleive the rates they're quoting are for people in unsupportive environments-- the rates go down with support and medical transition (if desired)

Also in the case of people who are outright facists-- the cruelty is the point.
They want us to die. Simple as.
It is planned way of flipping the narrative. Maia's leaked trove of 2600 (pages of) emails show some conversations back and forth with anti-trans people talking about how to address the fact that suicide risk is drastically reduced with gender affirmation. This is one way they are trying to spin that statistic to support their case, even tho it doesn't.
Because it is easier to blame the victim of discrimination than to admit fault.
conservative logic goes something like this,

trans people are confused and mentally ill, transitioning makes this delusion worse, people supporting them makes their delusions worse, they get sad and regret transitioning and kill themselves. 

it doesn't matter that they're wrong, it doesn't matter that suicide rates actually drop after transition happens, your happiness is incompatible with conservative philosophy. just be happy, deny them their reality by simply existing.
The suicide rate is the biggest argument FOR transition.  Trans folks living in their birth gender have catastrophic suicide rates.  People who transition have much lower rates.   Trans acceptance saves lives.
They wonder why the suicidal ideation, self harm and actual suicide rates are so high.  It’s really simple, we are being denied medical care.  In the UK, referrals to gender identity clinic are not measured in days or weeks.  They’re measured in YEARS with the wait to be seen in one clinic is 7+ years!
At least, for the time being, this is still happening!  I despair for the transgender community in the USA.
Because they will use every fucking thing avaible to them. No matter if it makes sense or not and no matter how awful it is.
I’m just a parent of a transgender child but I thought the suicide rates were high because of the lack of support most people get when they come out about it. Especially when they are young. I feel like it’s one of the biggest arguments to stop being such a hateful human being and even if you don’t agree with the decision just keep loving and supporting that person no matter what. I mean have people forgotten what love, true unconditional love truly is? I am ashamed of most of the Christians out there that say they are following Christ but turn their backs on people just because they don’t like their decisions. Hello have you not read about how Jesus loved EVERYONE! Oh wait he did get pissed off at people who held themselves as “holier than though” and judged other people. People in this world need to rethink their priorities. Instead of getting upset about a bunch of people living their best life and being themselves (not hurting anyone!) how about we worry about crimes that actually hurt people.
Because it supports the narrative that we are just mentally ill.
same with how they focus on being trans as a mental illness (dSm-FiVe ThO). ""these people dont need encouraging, they need treatment"" um yeah transition is the treatment....

treatment as far as theyre concerned involves forcing us to be cis, because they lack the empathy to be able to listen to us and try to understand why we feel this way, and thus dont understand why being able to transition is a matter of life or death for many trans people
I just said that exact thing under one of chris' tweets... 
No one would even think about suicide if it was normal and accepted to just be what you are no matter the gender or sexuality.. 
It's them and their unreasonable hate against us for just existing that causes ppl to hide in fear and in the end consider ending it all..

I just can't understand how ppl can be so close-minded and hateful against others that just want to live a happy and fullfilling life..
As if we would cause any harm..

Why would you want someone else to be happy if it isn't exactly the way you want it to be.......
Just let ppl be ffs.
Uneducated people use uneducated statistics not knowing what they represent.

It's about falsifying legitimacy of statistics. Like what is going on with the anti-drag and anti-trans bills right now. It's not a coincidence that they're trying to mark them as sex workers. It's so if they arrest anyone they can falsify a statistic by making it a sex crime and give a reason for unrest.

"" Look how many trans and drag child predators we caught "" , even though that won't be the case. It's misrepresentation.

\---------------------------------------------------

So when it comes to suicide rates, people don't want to acknowledge they're wrong or bad people. IT's easier to go "" These people are just sad and sick "" rather than acknowledge society oppresses and bullies people. Suicide doesn't happen in massive numbers due to a secondary mental illness.  Look at people in Asian countries and their suicide rates, they're not mentally ill. Their society makes allowances for bullying in their culture to be normalized to the point nets for jumping are put around schools.

Just like how the west makes allowances for people to be transphobic and homophobic. Society is wrong and we've allowed people to normalize disrespecting minorities by going "" Well it's not my belief that they're a woman "" , well guess what it wasn't your great-great-great grandfather's belief that a black man could own land, guess your beliefs don't matter anymore when it comes to HUMAN RIGHTS in a country that supposedly has LIBERTY as one of its main pillars of its belief system.
I believe matt walsh said “if you know what we are doing, why are you still doing it.“ in regards to people being trans
Victim blaming is one of the favorite manipulation tactics of abusers.
Its used to mock us, not argue with us, but also, we live in a very ableist institutional society. Its gotten a lot better in the past 10 years thanks to to internet and younger people, but there are so many millenials and up (speaking as a cusp millenial-genZ, those even just a few years older than myself are bad) in power who think being mentally ill at all is a grounds for denying autonomy. We literally have it happening with that new bill banning any autistic people from transitioning (in missouri i think?). And they do not care about semantics that neurodivergence is not illness. Theres the forced incarceration of anyone with psychosis (trust me, you can reiterate up and down that you have coping mechanisms but the moment i speak to a doctor they go into ""listen to me and if you refute my words im going to tell the cops that youre insane and threatening"" mode.. so of course people with psychosis become resistant to treatment when we arent treated like human beings).

Tl;dr its hate all the way down, for anyone who isnt presenting perfectly
they want to make a point of our mental struggles. they view being trans as a mental illness, so they view our higher suicide rate as something that proves their point. the thing they don't seem to understand is that trans people can be happy if they're treated with basic fucking respect and have access to the healthcare that they need
They think we can just be not trans and it’s just a minor inconvenience. It gets more protracted and hateful from there, but that is the basic underlying “truth” they believe that makes this all seem like a fun game that isn’t hurting anyone.

That of course is total bullshit. I can stop being trans no more easily than I can stop being tall or old… I’m mtf, my health care was banned tonight.  I have about 8 weeks of meds left, T will not be back in my body. We will exist.  We are a community that has spent our entire lives struggling to survive and we will continue.
With all the bud light content I’ve seen this week it’s become very apparent it’s unwarranted pure hate. Much like POC have been going through for centuries. It stems from lack of education, fear and ignorance. Nothing more fragile than a cis white religious guys ego. Oh no they are having to face that we exist in the world and we will have to learn to get along. The thing that scares me the most is how easy it is for some of the phobes to dehumanize us and literally wish harm or death rather than agreeing to disagree.
It's to try to tie us to mental illness, to paint our gender expression as some sort of sickness.
> Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.


TLDR: They don't care about the context they just want to hurt minority groups. They don't see words a tools to be respected like you and I do. Just things to be manipulated and twisted to attack their enemies who are both so strong they must be stopped yet so weak that they'll supposedly be easily defeated
They legit think trans people are just mentally ill and that's why so many kill themselves when in reality it's not because we're trans, it's because of how the world and these people treat us because we're trans
Because they want us gone. They want us dead, and if they can't have us dead they want us quiet and in pain. It's not about them not understanding us, or not realizing that they're causing pain, or not being aware of what effect the pain they cause has. They're doing it on purpose.
I've always hated the argument of ""Why should we accept you if you can't even accept yourself?"" Like, wut? We did..
Because they think we’re mentally ill. Which like to be fair a lot of us are for unrelated reasons, but that’s not a problem. We’re dying because we’re being harassed and pushed to the edge by people who want us dead to begin with. And much of the time their tactics work
This comes from the ""choice"" argument.

Reality, being trans can be pretty hard.

The argument they are presenting is ""then don't be trans.""

Much of the trans phobe argument is based on them insisting we can just ""not be trans""
Because they have no real argument against us, so they have to find every little piece of anything they can grasp to turn it into propaganda. They just need to justify their own hate and need to homogenize us back into ""traditional"" gender ""norms"" because they have savior mentalities. They think they're saving us from ourselves and some sense of perceived ""evil."" It's like the modern day equivalent of religious institutions sending out missions to ""civilize"" other groups and cultures because they're perceived as lesser, inferior, what-have-you.   


The truth is, I think we all just want to be left the fuck alone and not be treated like we're behind the glass in a zoo exhibit.
It's anything to fit the narrative.

Actually just had a great example from a friend over seas. 
First its: ""they're turning all our kids gay."" Then when it comes back saying there's like... 0.06% of people who are trans. (Or whatever the number is.) It turns to: ""see its just a phase for a few people."" 

(As I just... take the words from my friend I was talking to about it.) 

They'll spin any logic they can for their argument.
What these idiots don’t seem to understand is that that percentage (41) drops all the way down to 1 % when they have as much as one(!) person that supports them…
Conservatives will use damn near any piece of information that they can find that makes it sound like being trans is a terrible thing that should be eradicated.

The best thing you can do to help stop the fascist republicans is to vote blue every year. The more democrats that are in the government, the more likely it will be for these terrible anti-trans policies to be reversed.
Transphobes will say and do anything to delegitimize us, our identities and existence. They can’t accept the fact that if people and society as a whole were accepting and loving, that it would contribute to a decrease in trans suicide rate.
Because they don't care, I'm terribly sorry to say this, but straight up jokes about suicides and mocking literal dead kids is not uncommon, it's just abhorrent human behavior.
'Cause they're just saying bullshit since they only have this as arguments
Malice
You are so right, those stats should reflect their own assholery toward trans and lgbtqia+
They're just victim blaming. By saying ""if being trans rises your suicide attempt rate than stop being trans"" which is the same as the ""don't wear those clothes if you don't want to be assaulted""
Because they don't have a real argument as to why a free adult of sound mind should be able to do what we want with our bodies. So, they try to make us seem unstable and call it ""MeNtAL ILlNeSs"". Even though I'm sure most of us would argue (external factors aside) that living/presenting the way we'd like would make us more mentally well than having to live as a shell of a human being.
I'm not even trans and even I have to agree. How do they not see it? If they're killing themselves then that PROVES even further they struggle and have to put up with loads of shit. It's proves it's not a ""choice"" because, if it was, then they wouldn't do it. Transphobes are generally too fucking stupid to get it and I think they mostly say it just to joke about it. But suddenly they pretend to care about male suicide rates.

If you think trans people committing suicide is bad, transphobes, here's some advice: leave them the fuck alone. May then they won't feel the need to do it as much.
Most of them do realize what they’re doing, and most of them unfortunately do it on purpose :/ 

I just try my best to give them some facts in return; depending on the person, I spew out different statistics ☺️🏳️‍⚧️
Yea the amount of times that I’ve seen transphobes use this as an argument against us to prove that we are mentally unstable is ridiculous. Then when I tell them it’s because of people like you they be like they shouldn’t care about other people’s opinion to that extent though like sir you’re opinion to not respect other people’s rights directly affect us. Not to mention if you were getting bullied on a daily basis online at school by your own family wouldn’t you also off yourself like be for real then they go back to the mentally unstable argument
I wish we could bring crucifixion back to nail those fuckers up
Maybe the suicide rate isn't going down for trans ppl bc their treated less than human and its a pain in the ass to even try and transition and in the U.S. it's expensive as hell. Ik that I myself can only live as a man for so long and I'm only 18. If I'm not able to transition I'm prob just gonna give up. Even when I start if I'm treated anything like how everyone else is treated bc their trans then I'll take myself out before anyone even has a chance
[removed]
they like how high our suicide rates are, and want them to be higher, so that instead of doing it themselves manually, they can just point and laugh at people who are different than them and watch us drop like flies. they've built a community based on perceived strength, but their worldview will crumble if we succeed. the other day someone told me to kms because i let someone else in the door. they're not just anti-trans, or anti-queer, or even anti-minority; they are anti-compassion. i think if we focus on being compassionate towards our fellow people(insofar as it is safe to do so), we can defeat bigotry. that's not to say we all have to be perfect angels. my life is hard and i have it relatively easy. being too tired or upset to do something that isn't your responsibility is understandable. rioting is valid and necessary, but it's something to keep in mind.
They are saying see being trans makes you unhappy stop doing that. Rather then seeing mabie the oppression is a high reason.
They are driven by their religious convictions, which have nothing to do with the Bible or any other holy books, but rather with the discomfort of modern pastors and clergy.
Transphobes, like antisemites (often crossing over) don’t make arguments that you win by picking them apart logically, they’re only interested in winning and hurting their chosen out group  for the sake of retaining power and control and will use whatever nonsense attack they can for as long as they feel their stifling status quo is threatened.
I believe that there is a link between all the anti-trans crap and suicides in the trans community. Could use that as a counter ""argument"" that their idiocy and hatred drives suicide and they need to stop being such hate filled lumps of meat.
Hi All.  Well IMHO!,  They use our suicides to prove we are mental, C R A Z Y .... Loony Tunes.... AND! IF WE kill ourselves THEY keep their hands clean.  Being bullied , no matter who does it is still MURDER.  THEY want to eradacte us.  To put us in consentration camps. To take away our civil rights, and constitutional rights.  They say, ""we're not real people"".  Well You Know, Everyone Loves A Fascist(yeah right) We, the whole LGBTQ Group need to fight back , NOT with hate like they do, but at the political level. The ACLU helps BUT WE MUST VOTE TO BE HEARD...

I'm 74, M2F, on HRT 6 months, I live and dress openly as a woman 24/7. I've been out and proud for a year.

VOTE, Speak Out,

Michele
This is disgusting, and these are the same EXACT people that say that ""the transgenders"" are getting all the support in media and from everyone, they are not a 'marginalized/oppressed group'. Like make up your mind at least.
Well you see. Trans people are clearly mentally ill. Because only the mentally ill take their own lives. What was that? POWs killed themselves to avoid horrible torture? Nah, just mentally ill. The conditions others inflicted upon them had nothing to do with it. /s
they literally want us dead. that’s why.
I don't think it's just the mentally ill card, I worry it's that the way we discuss trans suicide normalizes trans suicide.
I am a parent to a trans child and tbh the going narrative of suicide freaks me out, I am aware there is lot of factors at play here and it's definitely a real issue but I don't think that painting a picture to young trans people that suicide is the only other option is not a healthy discussion. Yes some trans people have mental health issues yes some cis people have mental issues, if someones mental health issues for what ever reason are so bad they can no longer handle life why would you normalize suicide as the other option as if it's a given especially with someone who has lost autonomy over there own body.
Because they don't care about learning more in order to take an educated and reasonable stance. They've already made up their mind and nothing can change it, but they'll throw whatever information at us that they think might back them up without a second thought. It's like when I wrote papers in middle school by writing the entire thing and then finding quotes from the book to shove into places they might fit to get a grade. Except that's how they live their whole life
I think from their perspective, when a person “becomes trans”, the trans person starts regretting the transition which leads to suicide. So in their minds, if they show these suicide rates, it’ll push people away from “becoming trans”. Do you get what I mean? 

The whole thing with them bringing up that statistic is just to make a point - “being transgender is bad”. they don’t care for no proper debate or discussion, they simply just hate things that are different to their traditional beliefs.

Some of them may be completely ignorant to the fact that trans suicide rates are high because of having no access to treatment and unsupportive environments. But some of them are completely aware that the suicide rates are high due to hateful people like them, but they don’t care because it goes against their beliefs. Sucks fr.
Conservatives are the reason why so many of us get suicidal in the first place. Their transphobia foeces us back into the closet. It's just sad.
FR. The people I’ve encountered like this appeared to be 100% obsessed with us and it’s embarrassing how much time they spend on social platforms worrying about what we’re doing. It’s so irrelevant to them.
The middle ground between coexistence and genocide is mass murder. That’s not a legitimate argument. Sometimes a compromise is just capitulation by another name.
There is no compromise when it comes to human rights. 

Trans rights are human rights. Either trans people have rights, or they don't. There's no middle ground. 

Dressing bigotry up in the language of neutrality was something MLK explicitly called out decades ago. It is just another form of hatred.
Exactly! Everybody says that being trans leads to suicide bot noone says how many people did it because of harrasmwnt and transphobia.
It's the same logic of an abusive narcissist. ""You are miserable because you *made* me have to hurt you.""
That has something to do with a long-held Christian Catholicism belief that taking your own life is a sin against God. Back then a person who died of suicide couldn't be buried in church ground or go to heaven. Up till this day, suicide is still considered taboo in many Christian fundamentalists households. 🐝💙🤍❤️
These arguments are Coriolanus Snow-style.
The same study showed transitioning reduces rates by 67% and increases life satisfaction in >80% cases.
I’m the same way as I’d imagine many of us here are. They can’t wrap their minds around what kind of strength it takes for us to exist having years of our life going through that. We’re stronger than them.
Yeah and how much is the % of regular CIS people attempting suicide / who have thought of suicide in their lives? It's probably not as much of a difference as they think.
And then they’ll say we went down the wrong route to fix this even though very few of us regret doing this at all
Hrt and social transition saved my fucking life, literally.

And I still get suicidal sometimes, but it's literally just in response to not feeling accepted. ( I am working on it)
Suicide used to be a daily thought for me. I tried twice. When I started my transition, I stopped seeing myself as something horrible and started seeing myself as a work in progress. I'm not lying to my friends about who I am. They get to know the real me. I've gotten so many beautiful messages from them about how proud they are of me for coming out and how honored they are that I trust them. 

I haven't thought of self harm in months. I'm a happier, more positive, more focused person. Transitioning is saving my life. My only regret so far is that it took me until I was almost 40.
Transitioning is improving my life on literally every level. I am happier, more confident, and I don't hate myself like I used to.
Can someone link the source? ( I'm not saying it's untrue, just to save it)
it's bragging about genocide. they're not just against trans people or queer people or even minorities in general; they are against compassion. against revolution. against change. if we outlive the systems and people who want us dead or enslaved without becoming them in all but name, it will be through these things.
Exactly this. Other replies are ""feel good"" but not an actual answer. It's to show that people who are trans, or say they are (latter a point by folks that don't think trans is a real thing), are just mentally disturbed. It's the ""we are presenting to a mental illness rather than fixing it"" argument.
It’s because people like this are deeply unhappy and looking for anyone to blame but themselves. Grasping at straws trying to avoid accountability for their own unhappiness. Truly kind of a sad life these conservatives live. Like why are you so obsessed with me? I don’t even think about you.
okay I keep hearing people mentioning bud light, how are they related to trans people? forgive me for being out of the loop.
Mental illness like dysphoria, which can be cured with transition. And depression and anxiety which is *caused* by members of society spitting on us and refusing the reality that we aren’t someone to be witch hunted. They said the same thing about anyone who came out as gay years ago, “it’s mental illness”. And also just because someone *has* a mental illness that doesn’t make them a threat to others or themselves- you should know that there’s treatment and healthy ways in which people deal with them.
Its exactly like the meme
And as someone who was in therapy for 10 years trying *not* to be trans due to trauma and internalized transphobia, there is no other route. Psychotherapy does not do anything to cure gender dysphoria and never will.

This has the source and related articles.
Bud light released a pride themed can and conservatives are mad about it because they don't want their bud light to be gay or something ig
I was in denial for almost 20 years, I was miserable the entire time. Transitioning was the ONLY thing that helped fix My mental health. I literally tried everything. Being trans doesn't change with time
Thank you so so much! Have a nice day!
You know, I'm all for being skeptical of studies but... ""By targeting transgender advocacy groups, the survey underrepresented the experiences of transgender individuals who are not politically engaged. Also, a very high number of the survey participants (nearly 40%) had not transitioned medically or socially at the time of the survey, and a significant number reported no intention to transition in the future.""

Jesse... what the hell are you talking about? I don't think politically active trans people have fundamentally different experiences from those who aren't, but that one I might be wrong about. What I am sure of is that trans people who don't choose to medically transition are no less trans than people who do.

I have no idea what this site is trying to say with this. This doesn't seem to me to be unrepresentative of the trans experience. Not on these grounds anyway.
Yeah I linked that page for the links and citations, not the content. I'm not sure what being politically active has to do with anything. 

That said, while I agree that trans people who don't transition medically or socially are no less trans, it's pretty obvious why the distinction matters when discussing it: 

This study and its 41% statistic is constantly cited as a reason why gender affirming care is ineffective, that people shouldn't transition, and that being trans is a mental illness. It's constantly used to attack and harass people who transition. Yet 40% of respondents had not even transitioned. 

Additionally, other studies have shown that transitioning *significantly lowers* the suicide rate. That's the whole point of the treatment. Even speaking anecdotally, look at the number of people right here who say HRT or transition saved their lives. Before I transitioned,  heck before I even knew I was trans, I was suicidal and made attempts. Transitioning *fixed* me.
Ah, right. I managed to forget the context. That's a fair point on that one. I retract my objection on that one at least."	12lj3a4	trans	1275	0.98	2023-04-14 04:01:22
I know that i'm trans but i don't want to admit it	I'm 17 yo, and i think i may be transmasc. i don't really know how to explain, but i want to be a boy so much , but transitioning would be too hard so i try to convince myself that i'm not trans.i know that i could never look or feel like a cis male (i'm too short etc.) and it makes me really sad. I don't want to draw my family's attention to me i just wish I had been born a man and i don't know what to do	"I'm sorry you're going through this. For what it's worth I know some really cool shorter dudes, both cis and trans.
denial is some potent drug. for what's worth, many dudes are plenty short, I know quite a few who are shorter than I am and I'm 160cm.
i was in denial like yours for many years. it made me feel stressed and anxious and horribly confused. it’s best to not deny and let your egg crack
> i want to be a boy so much

Sounds like dysphoria. Being a boy may be the straightforward answer here. There are plenty of shorter guys out there and they live normal lives.

But of course, the decision on whether to transition is a very personal one. Nobody else can make that decision for you.
Just saying, you're 17, get on HRT quick and you'll have plenty of time to catch up on male puberty, which usually doesn't completely stop til around 25.
It sure sounds like you're trans, so denying it wont do much good. Try not to stress about the full picture of transitioning. It can be intimidating at first. Start small and work on accepting yourself for what you are. Get to the point where you no longer want to be a boy, but know that you already is one, and always has been. That's the first big step and one that brings great relief. Next is coming out, then possibly physical transition, depending on your needs. Small steps forward. Best of luck dude :) <3
Yoh dont need to transition to pass as a male or to be a male. Lots of trans guys dont transition and pass fine. Also lots cis guys are shot a lot of them in fact, its a common trait ti be short.
The shorter the king, the taller the crown 👑
Domics is only 5’3 and he’s a king. I met up with a famous YouTuber and her husband and he’s only 5’6. (Sorry if you use cm). My old boss was shorter than me and I know a lot of dudes who didn’t get past 5’6. Be the short king you are meant to be!
> I know that i'm trans but i don't want to admit it 

I think you just did
I feel this my brain keeps telling me I’m not, I do know I am a trans male. Also never say you are to short, short kings are awesome I’m 5’0”. Keep going ok you got this!
Look at formula one drivers! They’re all handsome short kings 😳😳
I know plenty of short people in the Marines. I know some who were AFAB and have or are considering transitioning. Big things can come in small packages ya know? 

Hugs
You can definitely pass even being short. There are plenty of cis men who are short. Also, if you start HRT soon you will get more results.

Do you desire been seen as a boy, having a deeper voice, facial hair, more body hair? HRT can bring those changes and help out with dysphoria. Good luck bro 💖
Elliot Page is 5'1 and valid as fuck. Boys can be any height!
There are lots of short dudes, Danny Devi to isn’t even 5’ and dantdm, Linustechtips, and a bunch of other popular YouTubers are actually quite short, but some are rather tall too, height doesn’t matter
Being short and transmasc myself, the most I ever get for it is my online friends jokingly calling me short. But they’d stop if I told them it actually made me feel off. I’d say go for it, experiment! I have far too large of a chest to pass as male without a binder and puffy clothes, but nothing that top surgery won’t fix (once I get the money for it) transitioning is rough. There’s going to be bumps and hurdles, but if this is who you really and truly believe you are, then by all means go for it. Nothing, and I mean nothing comes close to the sensation of euphoria when you finally feel comfortable. You’ve got this!
I’m transfemme but I was also in denial for a while. It sucks. Mine was because of my religion, so it may be different to yours.

My advice is you do you. Be true to yourself. You don’t need to transition if you don’t want to, you don’t need to do anything. Be yourself, whatever that means. You could be a guy, a girl, whatever you want, you’ll still be just as valid as yourself.
Hey do whatever makes you happy but just to give you my 2 cents I knew I was a girl at 17 , but buried that so deep that I thought it would never find me well now I'm 32 and just starting to transition so not saying you can't just deny it forever but it's hard. Hope you figure things out and nothing wrong with short guys .
Dude, short guys are cool as heck! And if you do decide to ever take hormones, then you might gain some height! If you think you’re trans and stuff, then I’d welcome you to the community with open arms!
One of my crushes is 5'4 (2 inches taller than me) and he, a cis man, is so cute and is still very manly. I'm sure it'd be the same for you friend!
I think I've got the same thing but AMAB in denial here. I've always considered myself at least male-leaning, but I think I might be a trans girl. Sadly, I have the lowest voice type possible for a male and I'm 178 cm (5'10). Worst part is, I'm 13! I'll probably be at least 185 cm (6'0), but probably more when I stop growing. I don't think I get too much dysphoria, so I just live as a guy, or a demiboy, but I wish I was a cis girl. I don't want to be a trans girl, I want to be a cis girl.
same, but MtF 

&#x200B;

looks like im not alone
Yoooo
Mood. 
I denied for a long time. 

For me... (I have a natural hour glass and health issues so working out to try and bulk up shoulders and stuff wouldn't help and I don't want to go on T for various reasons) even just acknowledging that I'm trans, and exploring what that means for me and finding what makes me happier in my body vs what makes me feel worse, did a lot. Even without doing anything to medically transition. 

Also like others have said, don't let height stop you. There are plenty short men, cis and trans alike.
Don't think about what box you fit in. Surround yourself with positive things and do what makes you comfortable. ♥️
I still don’t pass but I think I look pretty even if it’s not the most conventional way.  Do I want ffs? Sure. Generally I’m pretty ok with my appearance if someone isn’t pointing out the fact I don’t pass.

Edit: Point is, do what makes you happy! Screw what other people think.
I've been in your shoes, not even that long ago to be honest. But you should do some soul searching. I know it's against what your thinking right now but by taking the steps to transition, and becoming more comfortable with yourself I think you'll come to find it'll be well worth the effort, especially when you've reached the goal you set yourself out on. 

I know this is all really scary to navigate, but you've got this community behind you if you ever need some support.  ♥

Best of luck !!!
Yep. I'm pretty sure most of us went through a phase like this. I sure did.
Theres no height restrictions on being a man
thats admitting it
17 is still quite young! You have PLENTY of time to transition, and it's possible you could even gain more height from the transition as you go through male puberty! Don't think you don't have a chance! And there's nothing wrong with being a short guy either. Lotta great short dudes out there! 🙂
fwiw, a lot of cis men are short as well! height just whittles down to genetics, not your hormones, so some cis men are very short and some cis women are very tall. im sorry that youre going through this, and i hope you get to a point one day where you can accept and be yourself fully, whatever that may look like
Danny DeVito is 4’10” a very successful short guy. Don’t beat yourself up or you will stress yourself. Stress kills and the guy everybody wants to hang with. Good luck on your journey if you choose to accept the facts.
> I know that i'm trans but i don't want to admit it

I mean, bro... you kinda just did. <3
I'm going through exactly what you described except transfemme. It sucks and idk what to do either :/
Just be yourself, do what best for your mental health and be who you want to be. I hope you’re happy in the future Sir! :D

Anyways besides you who cares how tall you are, there’s no height requirement to be a man.
our situations sound very similar ): just remember that your life is your own, your family won’t always agree with what you do but hopefully they’re understanding enough to accept you for who you are. Transitioning definitely isn’t easy, but if it makes you more comfortable in your body then it’s worth a try. I’ve also tried to convince myself that I’m not trans, but often wishing you were born as the opposite sex isn’t a very cis like mindset haha. Just ask yourself if you’re truly ok with not transitioning and living how you are. Accepting ourselves is a long journey, just remember that you’re not alone. I wish you all the best, and I hope things get better for you soon
Tons of cis men are short. You can be who you want to be, who you really are, no matter what you look like. Follow your heart and be happy, because the misery of denying yourself will build, and I know that no one wants you to go through that. We’re here for you
Hey now, everyone loves a short king. As for passing as a man, hormones do work. The societal stuff is scary, won't lie. But I know that for me, denying that I'm trans didn't help me at all
if that's any consolation for you almost all my cis male friends are shorter than me and I'm not even that tall.
I get what you mean. I first remember thinking I was trans about 4 years ago, not long after I turned 15. I didn't want to be trans so I just tried not to think about it. That happened multiple times I've the next 4 years. It was only last year that I realized I wasn't doing myself any favors by trying to hide from it. It is a personal decision to decide what you want to do when you realize that you are trans, so I recommend you do as much self-reflection as you can. I still am not sure exactly if I want to fully transition or when, so I'm just taking it one step at a time.
Sounds like you're trans! Transfemme here but all the fear of transitioning, saying it's too hard(too hard to be yourself? Maybe it's worth the fight and the difficult path🤔). How you're expressing these things reminds me of my own tough mental games.

I tried to ""make it work"" as a gay man.... But it was still off. And after 32 years I stressed myself into such a state that I was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital... Now I'm much better. Therapy, self acceptance, trust the process and yourself, and time. 

Btw you're only 17!! You can totally still get taller!! Don't want to get your hopes up, but I knew a couple cis guys that shot up after highschool. Puberty doesn't really finish until around 25.... who knows what you and a doctor could do at this point in time!?! 
And I'm pretty sure every trans person wishes they could have started hrt sooner. So...

Take a breath. Talk to your therapist and your doctor. Learn your options. And there's nothing wrong with needing help loving yourself. 

And I personally find short guys to be really sexy, and I'm 6ft haha. Especially stocky/muscled short guys hehe and I'm sure after some testosterone and maybe a few rounds of weight lifting and you'll be feeling your masc self!
Well, if it helps, we've all been there. Being trans is hard. Telling your family is hard. But.

The truth is, this shit doesn't go away. I knew I was trans when I was 17 and I didn't do anything about it until I was 39. And there were damn good reasons. But nonetheless, I lost a lot of years that I could have been me. And those years are just gone now. In the end, I still had to come out to everyone. And everyone is more people when you're older. Also, I was lucky--I never got married--but a lot of trans people get married and have kids and then that's something that gets in the way.

So, I guess I'd think harder about transitioning. Because actually, what I didn't realize when I was 17 was that being me was just so much more fun.
I feel you here. I'm in the same situation.  I want to be a girl, wish I was born a girl, etc. Yet it would be too annoying to transition and my sibling coming out aswell would make it seem like I'm just copying for attention.  What I mean is, your not alone. Your valid whatever you do :)
""i know that i could never look or feel like a cis male (i'm too short etc.) and it makes me really sad""

There are short cis men. You're also 17, so you still have time to grow taller. That being said, you don't have to transition if you don't want to. And if you do want to transition, there are different ways to go about it. ANY change in your life to align it better with your inner experience, no matter how small, is a kind of transition. It's not all big changes, surgeries and hormones. Using the pronouns that fit when interacting with people? That's a kind of transition. Deliberate changes to how you act and present? That's a kind of transition. Telling people you're a man, actually? That's a kind of transition.

Transition is more complex and involved than flipping a switch from ""I'm gonna conform to my AGAB"" to ""OK, all male now"". And you can pick and choose in what way you want to go forward. You can change your mind about that stuff, too. A lot of people do. And you're very young, so you have more time to figure it out than some (many) of us.

At any rate, regardless of what you end up deciding or not deciding, good luck.
im transfemme but i feel the exact same way, i cant offer any advice cuz im stuck too but hey, at least ur not alone
I feel sorry for you - but you shouldn't give up so easily! If you feel that you are a man, you probably won't be able to suppress those feelings your whole life long. At least not without feeling miserable, I guess. And testosterone can do lots of great things! Maybe it will take some time but I've seen so many pics/videos of trans men by now who don't look like women in the slightest - neither their face nor their body. Your height might not change but you shouldn't worry too much about that. Like others here said, short guys exist. The drummer of a German rockband I really like is 158cm (5'2), he's an attractive guy and, as far as I know, he's cis. There are several famous (cis) guys I know who are 5'5, and I also see men in real life sometimes who are very short. That wouldn't automatically out you as trans or let you appear more feminine! Masculinity hasn't anything to do with height in my opinion. You should just be who you are! (Of course I don't know how save that will be for you, if the people around you will be accepting etc. But I think you shouldn't suppress your feelings just because you think you won't look masculine enough. Pretending to be a woman will very likely be a lot more painful on a permanent basis!)
My brain goes down the same train of thought way too often(except mtf context in my case). So I'd like to think I can somewhat relate to your pain.

I'm stuck in this weird stalemate where the thought of both ends of the binary give me imposter syndrome, but where enby still feels like a dishonest description of myself. But not as dishonest as agender/a-spec, which I labeled myself longer ago. But can I go back to pretending I'm cis? No, seems like the more I run, the more sure I become about being trans.

In moments of clarity, my only clues are my gender envy for people presenting as ""the opposite gender"", and the mysterious but good feeling I get anytime I present even slightly as said gender. I guess it's gender euphoria? Whatever it is, imo it's a better clue than dysphoria. Dysphoria is something that usually gets lost in the white noise of self-denial, and you don't have to be stereotypically ""dysphoric"" to be trans.
Bro, I don't know how to tell you this, but guys are short sometimes. It just happens...

And if you want to be a boy, the prevailing trans take on that is that you already were one to begin with, you were just assigned unaccordingly. I don't know about ""feeling"" like a cis-male, that might never happen, but with modern advances in medicine, you can certainly look like one.

And anyway, what does a cis-man ""feel like"" in the first place? Gender isn't real, y'know, we made it up to justify sexism. I strongly suspect that being a ""Cis-male"" or a ""trans-man"" doesn't feel like anything, or nothing new at any rate. So if you think that it might make you happier to be a man, trans or not, there's no reason not to be. No one can really make a solid case that you're so fundamentally different from a cis-man that it'll just never be the same. TERFs try, of course, but their logic is always flawed. Especially if you get on Testosterone, because at that point all the minor differences between male and female that all men seem to have in common will start to be reflected in you anyway, aside from the obvious sexual anatomy (*to an extent*. you should do some research on the effects of T, it's actually rather interesting). But really, how many people do you share that with anyway? No one who wouldn't make you unhappier for not understanding in the first place.

So, go for it! Be a man! No one has an actual reason why you ""can't"" or ""shouldn't."" So just do it.
i was in denial just like you for years- im 26 now and finally starting to transition because I finally felt ready and couldn’t deal with the dysphoria any longer. it’s a lot to deal with- a lot of thoughts and feelings and stress. you don’t have to transition if you don’t want to, or if you want to wait that is perfectly valid too. there is no age limit. plenty of short dudes, cis and trans alike, pass. :) i believe in you! ♡
one of my good friends is shorter than me and he is the most passing trans man i’ve ever met! (for reference i’m a 5’ 4” trans girl, he’s 5 foot) height doesn’t mean anything when it comes to being a man! i used to think it was easier to keep my desire to transition in, but once i got my own place and got supportive friends who had resources for me to transition i finally started! and it’s not as complicated as you think, hormones do so much for people
My (presumably) cis-male dad is 5'0"". Being short is not a disqualifying factor at all.
the shorter you are the easier it is to put this crown on you, king
You don't have to be ashamed of it, but if you're uncomfortable with it you don't have to admit it unless you want to
I lived like that for 7 years, but I’m mtf. For my experience denial won’t get you anywhere. Do what you feel is right for you, always. If you don’t think this is the moment to transition don’t, but pulling it off just because of fear isn’t the best approach, or at least that’s my experience, but rushing things if you’re not ready probably isn’t the best. Maybe try leaving hints or making small changed to see how people react and see how you feel
Didn’t you just? 

Flip a coin heads your trans tails your not, 

And if it’s a result you dislike congrats you know your answer 

Sorry your struggling
Cis men are all different. I hope you can become free and be the man you want to be.
You don’t need to be tall to be manly, my monkey for a manager can tell you that
If it helps you any, this is exactly how I felt growing up and in my young adult years, I always thought it could never be possible for me, I met someone when I was 20 who was extremely supportive of my feelings and wishes, I however have not been with them for over a year and I'm now 8 months on estrogen. Surround yourself with people who support you for your true self and sooner then you expect you'll have the courage for yourself to do the things you need to and take action. Good luck with your journey 😊
You'll eventually work through this and figure out what's best for you. Just keep in mind it's about what you need, not what your family needs, and that often the most worth doing things are incredibly difficult. Also short kings are still kings.
Denial definitely isn't fun, I was full of self doubt and wasn't able to fully accept who I was untill I could see myself living a life where I was proud and that helped me gain confidence just knowing who I was. But I also am going to say this hoping it helps but you don't have to transition you can just do what ever is comfortable for you. You can still be trans and not transition it is all about feeling better about yourself. There is also no rush just make sure you are comfortable with what you do in life and who you are, that's all that matters.
Hey there! Transfem here, and I wanted to say that having the courage to reach out and ask for advice is really impressive. Although I can’t 1-to-1 relate to the transmasc experience, the trans experience in general is very similar. If there’s some advice I could give to possibly help you find clarity, it’d be this: In 30 years, when you’re living away from your family and possibly with one of your own, do you imagine yourself as your assigned gender or as transmasc? Would you have a happier life if you were transmasc?

It’s really easy to get caught up in the what-if’s and short term issues, but if it’s safe to do so, it might be worthwhile to just experiment with dressing more masculine, use makeup for faux facial hair, or even using a packer if that’s of interest to you.

Above all, you are valid. I think you could benefit from exploring your gender and just seeing what feels right to you, and hopefully that will grant some insight. If you do end up identifying as transmasc, I wouldn’t worry too much about not passing due to height and other factors as plenty of short kings exist and HRT (if you wanted that) would help a bunch.

Good luck brother 😉, rooting for you!
I am sorry to say, but this isn't gonna go away. Or at least it didn't for me.


Just because something can't be perfect doesn't mean it's not better than the alternative.

I’m transitioning and hardly want to admit it. We can do this together!!!
Hey! Short, feminine appearing transmasc here! I used to be in the same boat as you, too small, too feminine, transitioning isn't feasible because of family and situation right now, etc. etc. I'm here to tell you that you are not alone. Hell, I still haven't started transitioning medically. If you have people that you can confide in and support you, perhaps try slowly transitioning socially. It'll take baby steps to one day get where you want to be, but it'll be so worth it in the end. I'm cheering you on!

PS: since you specifically mentioned height, I'm only 152 cm (4'11), and I was pretty insecure about it, but then I met one of my best friends, a cis guy whose only just a bit taller than me, 159 cm. If your goal with transitioning in the future is to pass as cis, you'll definitely make it, no matter your height!
First off, I know plenty of short men, height is not a factor to masculinity. Secondly, if you really want to transition you should, just remember that no one is forcing you to transition, if you decide to transition you should do it in your own way. Third, if you do not want to draw your family's attention that's completely fine, most people don't want their attention either. Just remember that this decision is completely up to YOU, and no one else, no one else should have any impact on your decision or what you do.
I have literally seen 5’3” cis men with online dating. My amazing trans son changed clothes and hair to what he feels amazing in. His confidence is fantastic and he has glowed up. I can’t imagine him as a “she”. No hormones yet either. Anyone who doesn’t support him can buzz off or go through momma bear here. It was a gradual but quick process. Hair became shorter and shorter. Clothes were full on male tops and now pants. He came out to anyone who couldn’t figure it out in his time.
I feel that
This is more relatable than I’d like to admit
you can be trans and not transition!! many transmasc and fem individuals don’t medically transition. it’s your choice what to do with your journey. i almost didn’t transition medically myself, but i had too much voice dysphoria so i did it. it’s all up to you what you’d like to do with your body. no one else can decide your transition. i’m rooting for you anyway you’d do so.
I'm non-binary...or something. I was born male and I am 5'1"". But at the turn of the year I had an identity crisis about my gender and sexual orientation.

Some my family and friends know now. Some don't fully understand. And others don't know at all. I'm understand because even though I'm 33 I live with family. And wearing makeup and dressing more feminine has been a process where keep pushing the limits of what they deemed as normal. At the end of the day I really think I'm a post-genderist...and that makes me feel better because I don't feel the need to conform to anything. Gender roles and things associated with gender are all man-made anyway...so I kinda feel it shouldn't matter.

BUT. I do get it. Because sometimes I just wanna be a woman. I want to look like a regular woman and be perceived that way. But I kinda stick with being a dude or labeling myself as non-binary because it feels more realistic to me, as I don't see myself getting on hrt or having surgery...at least not that this point.

Just worry about being comfortable with yourself and trying out new things. When you find out what really makes you comfortable you might be end up being more brave in the face of  judgment. Like sometimes when I dress feminine and wear makeup, I have more confidence than when I was just trying to be a dude. I don't know why...but because of that it's easier to shrug off people who bring any negativity.

The hardest thing, to me, is/was wondering who will abandon me or who will i have to abandon if/when they know who I really am. But living in fear and feeling shitty trying to be a fake version of yourself becomes tiring.

It'll take time, but I think you'll be okay. Don't rush this process. And love yourself.
Hey, you got an entire life to figure that out. I haven't vibed with being a girl since puberty, but I didn't fully come out of my egg until I got 20. Experiment, see what you're comfortable with, and figure out where you stand.
I used to feel this way, I’m 29 now and just started transitioning and Ive been happily surprised with the options that are out there for trans people and how much I can change my body to feel I am no different than any other person born a male. Whatever you choose try not to do it out of fear and follow your vulnerable heart ❤️
I denied the fact that I am trans for 7 years. You can only ignore how much everything sucks for so long, and by the end of it, you just realise that you just wish you had started being yourself sooner.
I know this one cis guy named Tony who lives and exists as a stereotypical 1950s New Yorker (without the racism and sexism) and he's like 5'1. If people allow him to exist then I'm pretty sure a short king like yourself will be fine.
I'm 5'2 and my bestfriend who is cis is also 5'2. Our goal is to not become cis, our goal is to care for ourselves any means necessary. Whether thats stealth or by waiting to transition.

  
I know cis women who look like men and cis men who look like women. So I really dont know why people make us out to be such a strange ass thing. Just know you'll always pass more than  a ton of cis people out there.  


Regardless you'll figure it out. I'm sorry you are going through this though. I hope tomorrow is better for you.
You need a quality therapist. I wish I got one at your age.

I'm 33 and only just now started coming out as transfem. I wanted to fit in with the other boys so put myself through hell trying to be a ""bloke"" (I'm Australian). 

I started watching sports, became a superstar boxer, developed a reputation of the ""gentle giant"". I'm 6'5"", I have strength behind most folks capability. 2 weeks ago I moved someone's house all on my own. Furniture and all.

I'm 33, people have known me as the biggest and strongest for so long, it's now hard to let go of. The whole reason I went on this journey was for validation as ""one of the boys"".

If I started on HRT before finishing puberty I wouldn't have grown as much. I wouldn't be the hulking giant I am today. In reality, I am happiest when I'm on my own, painting my nails in my silky sleeping gown. No expectations, no crave to fit in, just me in my space.

You may not be trans, maybe you're non binary. You'll never know unless you explore this side of yourself.
Hey as a trans masc person who is also 17 I absolutely get this. Internalised self transphobia is absolutely normal. I have accepted my identity but I do continue to have similar thought. Sometimes I’ll just cry over knowing not being able to where a wedding dress, or wanting to wear “womens” clothes but not being able to because I know I’ll feel dysphoric. It’s hard but it does get easier. 
If you can get a binder I recommend doing so. T and surgery are long roads to leap on so you are allowed to take as much time as you like to figure your self out.
I know lots of short duders. You already admit here you are trans. Why is it too hard?
trans enby here daring a short 1.65~ cis guy and ngl short guys rock.

t4t relationships are always a great and lovely-like-no-other experience.

good luck on your journey. being trans does not have a static definition or look. you do you and that's what matters.
I seriously regret not coming out when I first realized I was trans. I feel like I wasted do much time pretending to be something that was ultimately unsustainable.
r/egg_irl


In all seriousness though, short guys are the best kind imo. I feel your struggle, just the other way around.
This is almost the same situation I was in at age 15. I'm 25 now. My advice is to accept it sooner rather than later and try to do something about it as soon as you can. Do not let insecurities stop you like they stopped me. There are short men who are cis, believe me. If you're transmasc, then you are - and it certainly is amazing. In terms of family, that's tricky but if you can safely start HRT/do other gender affirming things, do it now rather than later. You need to do what makes you happy, because later in life, you will regret it if you didn't. It's never too late though; I will take hormones soon after years of agony and severe body dysphoria and it's definitely so unbelievably worth it. You should be free to be the person you are and live your life authentically. Don't pretend to be someone you are not.
""Transistioning is too hard"" is an excuse a lot of people use to deny their trans identity. No one said it would be easy but it'll be worth it in the long run. Happiness holds the greatest value in life.
I was in the same situation when I was your age, I knew but I didn't want to accept it. I ended up coming out at 21 and wishing I had done so earlier because I am so much happier now. However, if you don't feel ready to do so, it doesn't matter, just do it when you feel like it's your time, I don't regret waiting, bc I don't know what it would have been like when I was 17, I think my parents would have been able to convince me that I am not trans, so coming out at 21 made me much stronger in my position and whatever my parents said didn't affect me as much.
Hey, don’t worry, there’s plenty of short kings in the world, my best friend is a guy and he’s like 5’3”, don’t worry about being too short
I'm really sorry but it won't work, you only loose years at trying to convince yourself without ever fullfil your objective.
Being trans sucks
I really really urge you to look up before and after transmasc pics. There are some shockingly amazing transformations and it might give you the confidence you need. 💜💙💜
Being too short doesn’t matter I literally know a 17 year old AMAB(assigned male at birth) guy who is like 5 foot 3
Hey! I know exactly how you feel. I was your age when I started to have these feelings / realizations about myself and my identity… and it’s scary lol

It’s totally normal to feel this way. Remember that you don’t have to dive in head first with this. Experiment with your identity for a while. If you don’t typically dress masc, start wearing more masc clothes. If you want to cut your hair short, go for it (hair grows back after all!) and the internet is great for… testing the waters before you jump to irl stuff too. See how you get on with using male pronouns, maybe even play around with some nb pronouns or even some neopronouns if that makes you comfortable! There’s absolutely no rush here and you’re still very young! 

Transitioning totally depends on what the individual wants to do. You don’t need to go on hormones or have surgery to be a valid trans person. You could go your whole life without having these treatments and you’d be just as much of a man as the folks who do.
I’m 4’11 quite possibly 4’10 and I am taller than the most hunkiest cis guy I know at work. Don’t let height define your gender.
I’m amab and I’m 5’1. I’ve never been mistaken for anything other than a cis guy, trust me, it’s not all about height :) you can be a awesome guy regardless
You don't have to transition to be trans. You can identify as a boy, and not change anything about yourself, including your wardrobe, hair, etc. It's all up to being comfortable with what you look like, the way your body looks, and and how you feel within it. Good luck, friend.
Best thing I can say is yes transition is hard and I was in your exact position (however mtf) and I can say that transitioning is yes extremely hard, but living with this constant dysphoria is harder and only gets worse. Pls consider this as my mental space after accepting and coming out has improved so much💕💕 good luck
Don't stop growing until 21-23. Not much more growth from there, but start at 18, could gain some height
I'm sorry you're going through this but for what it's worth, my brother and I are only 5"" and 5""1' respectively.
I was in your shoes back when I was 16, couldn’t face the fact I’m trans until 18 and I got mental health care for other stuff. You may not want to face it but you’ll eventually have to, try writing or seeking out health care if you need that to be able to face this fact- it won’t just ‘go away’ if you ignore it.
Short kings are the best!
Dude I feel you but please try not to be in denial. For what it’s worth me and my friends liturally once joked about how terrible it would be for me to be trans (pre me coming out) because I have the most masculine build ever 💪(•3•). but cracking the egg helps a little so I would highly recommend
Facts, the coolest dude I know is cis and is like 4’9
If I'm not wrong, Kevin Hart is 160 too.
I did same lol denial is pretty comman but once the egg cracks you feels good that you accept yourself
I’m gonna cry im 26
Oh great. 7 more years of this shit :/
It’s easier to make smaller drivers fit in cars
from a 6'1 trans girl that had a shitty voice,, voice training goes a long, long way (do it while ur as young as possible as well!!), and fuck height standards. theres so many taller cis girls and taller cis female celebrities,, and who cares if ur taller, be the tall queen you are!!
Before I came out I was so scared that my family’s entire view of me would change. I just wanted to be myself but male. It took actually coming out to realise that while there was a change they had to make it didn’t affect who I was to them.

Just because puberty naturally stops by then doesn't mean you can't extend it, that's literally the point of HRT. You're good Friendo, I promise!
some people grow and shrink depending on the type of hrt regardless of starting point due to muscle loss or growth.

muscle loss is from mtf hrt

muscle gain is from ftm hrt

But then even results may vary. But its pretty common so its more of a guarantee than some other things on hrt. Hrt is INSANE. Probably the best drugs (dont do drugs kids obvi)
We don't really stop physically developing till our 30s and even then hrt is fuckin nuts.
I'm just finishing up (26 this year), don't worry, the last 8 years of natural male puberty aren't bad, it's mostly just hair growth and getting stinkier.

I love being trans!!!	"I'm absolutely facinated by transitioning and there's so much beauty, poetry and strength in being able to transform my body like this! Of course dysphoria still sucks ass but I don't feel sad I'm not a ""real men"" or whatever. 

I just want to build this beautiful transexual body of  mine and obliterate gender!! I'll love my scars, my prosthetics and my ""trans voice"" with all my heart. 

Fuuuuuck the binary cisgender norm dude. Being trans rocks, being queer is based and being a freaky gender cyborg is the most poggers thing one can strive for!"	"the gender cyborg uprising is at hand, guys, girls and non-binary hos. We must unite!
The world desperately needs more trans joy. Thank you for your service!
I’ve started exploring who I am and who I want to be, despite the job I hate, a family who doesn’t share my views, and a government who would rather not accept me, I love who I’m becoming and the only the I would change is me exploring myself sooner!
This dude knows what's up! I'm a happy and proud transfem! Join all my fellow proud trans pals, we must unite,  together we shall reign upon this cis world!
Some dude called me a fag but I think the mods took it down (thanks guys!).

Just wanted to say that I totally am one and send a big fuck you to that guy ❤️
HECK YEAH! That's exactly the kinda thing I needed to hear today, thank you. Keep being great!
Finally! Someone who shares my opinion! As a matter of fact! I’ll make a post about it later too! I’m glad your living your life in the positive dude!
Gender cyborg🤣🤣🤣☺️ I love it
You go, dude!!! 

I’m so proud to be Non-Binary… I’ve never been this happy! Let’s unite and statt the trans-cyborg uprising.
I fucking love you
i hate being trans :(
Behind you with all my heart!
I will take control of my body, reforge myself through my will and my efforts!!!
<3 i love being trans as well, even though i am the only person that thinks it's a good idea for me.. i can't stop loving myself and i would rather be trans/non-binary than to be stuck in either gender! It's too much fun being able to express myself in all the ways i can think of <3  


even though my life is terribly lonely, there is so much more joy in it after i stopped telling myself what i should and shouldn't do regarding my sexuality- and instead going with how i feel <3 it feels like i finally belong somewhere..
wow, that's actually really uplifting! you don't usually see a lot of trans folks being this positive, it's incredibly refreshing and inspiring:) wish you all the best man and thank you for making me realize it may not be all that bad!
Gender cyborg should unironically be an earnest goal for trans people and everyone really. For example, ingesting and monitoring hormones has gotten easier over time for us, imagine having an implant that you have fine grained control over. Imagine having agency over the fluidity of your gender. The technology we have for our gender expression is limited by our imaginations, and there's potentially all manner of new genders in the future that we don't have the capacity to express today.
Hell yeah!! Thanks for cheering me up dude!!
Can't tell you how refreshing it is to see a post like this, usually it's all doom&gloom about transition.
I wish I didn’t have to be trans. I wish I was comfortable with myself. It’s scary and it’s a lot of work and I worry I’ll never accept myself. I’m glad you are in a healthy place
Thank you for inspiring to be myself today ❤️
HELL YEAH!!!!! 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Nothing makes me happier than seeing other trans people happy ❤️ Thanks for the shot of hope! 🏳️‍⚧️
We need more joy! And you delivered it!
Hell yeah! I feel similarly about myself and everyone else who's trans. We're awesome!
i love how there are people like you out there who also love being transsexual as hell :+)
heheh ahhh that’s awesome I see it the same way
This post is so wholesome and makes me so happy. I’m so happy that you are happy, friend! And you are absolutely right, being trans is BEAUTIFUL 💞💞💞💞💞
Did testosterone not change your voice?
It do be like that sometimes
i wish i could feel like this
Oh wow! This is such a positive vibe! Getting real good feelings here! Thank you for this!
Me
Good for you, I wish I could feel the same.
I can’t really say I agree, but I like your attitude!
FUUUCCCKK YASSSS QUEEEEN!!!
I don't want to be called a ""freaky gender cyborg"" or seen as ""freaky."" I just want people to see the man I am.
I feel you 100% in loving being trans! If I was born cis then I wouldn’t be who I am and have the journey I’ve had so far full of amazing people from this beautiful community💕 I’m trans and I don’t care who hates it! trans is beauty!
hells yea bro
Same here! Didn't even start HRT but socially transitioning, wearing the clothes I like and changing legally my name are the best things I could do in so many years!
I'm glad we share that happiness and pride despite adversities
Thank you!!!! You’re amazing 💙💖🤍💖💙
fuck yeah! being trans is the best way for us to be!
I’m a pretty stealth dude, and I agree. My trans body is awesome, and I’m glad being trans is a part of my identity.
This was so nice to read, thank you 😊
I love the attitude! wish it was unanimous
Honestly i feel the same, because i can't wait to get those flat chest scars. I can't wait to transition. I think scars are a way of telling that I'm a warrior, a survivor of dysphoria. They're battle scars and something in would be proud of. Sadly it will take a long time before I get them🥲
Well said
haha love the ""gender cyborg"" thing so true!! fucking love being trans
Lol, I freakin love your energy my dude.
I’m having so much fun reading this in a super hyped and fast voice one my head, I’m glad you loving being you ❤️
Just being you is outstanding positive 🙂
Beautiful!!!! Hell fucking yeah I’d give you an award for this if I had one, this is the spirit 😄🤘 celebration of raw authenticity
I can relate to being a gender cyborg. The altering of my body and hormones, thru the use of modern medical technology I'm becoming something ""new"" in society. I'm not a 'real man' or a 'real woman', and that's OK because I'm trans. We exist.
Check my screen name: I couldn't agree with you more (especially about the cyborg part)! :D
I always feel weird about people saying I'm a man. I'm not a man, I'm a TRANS man, for some people that may comforting but to me being trans is a very very big part of my identity, being trans comes before the fact I'm a man. This may have something to do with the fact I don't 100% identify with the male label it's more like 85%.
reading this made me 10x more happy of being trans :,)
i hate it :/
I think the term ‘transsexual’ is outdated and people should stop using it.
I wish I could feel the same way about this

In perfect world no one would be trans. There is absolutely zero benefits of being trans, it's only logical to hate it.
i'm so happy for you!! although it may be really rough sometimes, this just shows how absolutely fucking *worth it* it is. i wish you all the best this world has to offer you, and i sincerely hope i can get to that point of self love one day
We can win my dude!! We just gotta keep moving foward!!
Completly agree with you, and I feel like that wouldn't even be for new genders, but that it would just render gender (as the opressive structure that i is) obsolete!

Having control over our sexes and reproductive fluids is simply allowing humanity to thrive!
Oh I'm not on T yet. Gonna start it soon tho :) 

The ""trans voice"" thing is just a name to how sometimes the voices of transmasc people can have a specific timbre to them due to testosterone being introduced later in life + ""feminine"" speech manners
That's completly fair man, all I'm sharing is my own feelings towards my identity! I've always been seen as a freak, so I just embraced it. 

There's nothing abnormal or monstruous about trans bodies and identities tho, it's all about the optics and the beauty of the archetype of the monster. It just speaks greatly to my experience.

I wish you all the best on your journey dude, you deserve to be respected as the man you are!
Duuude I totally relate to this!!
It's been a process for me you know? I think I feel like this because of a combination of having a suportive family and reading gender/marxist theory. I look at the fucked up injustices in the world and my anti-capitalist world view just makes me want to change it all and fills me with energy. 

So when I look at me being trans I only see how it revolutionary and beautiful it is, even if society really fucking sucks
Just did! Cheers dude 🥂🏳️‍⚧️😎
There's nothing more beautiful than trans joy. Being happy as a woman is genuinely the best thing ever for me. Everytime I see a happy trans person I am very happy by proxy. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What are you even on about? In a perfect world we wouldn't have violent binary fictions about people's bodies and behaviors and we could all thrive in our beautiful human diversity. Being trans rules and we only suffer cause our society's sick
True
: )  


it's a good and a bad thing.. loving yourself many times means giving up compromises you had with people up to the point when you accepted your own quirks....  


loving yourself can be a lonely thing- just keep that in mind... but being trans IS WORTH IT..... I would have been either homeless, a monster or stone cold dead at this point had i not started hrt
 I want to feel trans as in ""transhuman"" not just transgender. Trans as in transcendence, not transition. Gender should be an instrument we wield, practice, and create art and beauty with. A revolutionary inversion of power where our bodies are shaped by our consciousness and not the other way around.
I doubt such a timbre would be unique to trans men, and you’ll pick up masculine speech patterns quickly if you hang around enough guys. Just make sure you hang with cill guys, or you could wind up sounding like a douchebag. Oooh, and consider picking up singing!
thanks. I get treated like a freak a lot and it just hurts a lot, I can't get myself to embrace it. all the best on your journey too, dude.
That explains it, my family barely tolerates me and tries to get me to detrans, I'm also in germany where trans rights are kinda not very good and I have to diy my medical transition because there is only a single qualified therapist in my region and he only does group therapy, which won't fly for me.
this!!! it's so rare to see anything about trans people that's not depressing, this really made me feel a lot better🖤
We suffer because our bodied aren't what they should be.
Body dysmorphia isn't caused by this society, need for transitioning isn't caused by this society.

Being trans does not rule. It makes peoples killing themselfs, hating themself and their body, it's fucking expensive, getting surgeries and being in medication their whole life.. 
And no matter what, you won't ever be what you were supposed to be. Absolutely nothing rules about that.

If I were you, I would wait with the transitioning because it sounds like that you aren't planning it for the right reasons.
Oh I'm so sorry about your family and I had no idea Germany wasn't up to date on the access to medical transition

I wish you all the best, hopefully you can go to a more central region of your country and get what you deserve ❤️"	wc37nl	trans	1225	0.95	2022-07-30 17:51:19
Just this week, I got accepted into the royal college of physicians. Come so far in 6 years	I was a sad depressed confused person 7 years ago. Never been so confident than the last year ❤️	"Congratulations OP!!
Thanks guys. Much love. Currently away for a week in Tuscany.
Congratulations
Wow. Just wow.
The place looks beautiful, holy! Big congratulations!
That's really oppressive. Nice job!!!
Awesome, congratulations!!  🥰
Congratulations!!! The world can always do with more women in charge, especially as doctors! Women have to deal with so much bs from doctors, *especially* women of colour. Getting pain dismissed, getting substandard treatment, getting told that you're just imagining things.

A friend with acute pancreatitis was told her pain was just because she carried her newborn around too much. She *almost died* because they didn't even do a blood test.

And that isn't even cutting the surface of the issues queer people face while seeking treatment. 

You're going to do great things. And for what it's worth, this Internet stranger is very proud of you.

Keep fighting the good fight ❤️
Congrats! That’s huge news!
Well done!
Congratulations!
Congrats OP!!!! That is amazing!!! And you look amazing too!!
Yea, congratulations you go girl, rock it!!
Congrats sis
That’s incredible! Way to go!!
Just Wow! You are a true inspiration. Congrats! 

This inspires me, following my way back to an academic life + becoming myself step by step 💛
Congratulations! You're doing so amazing !! xx
Congratulations 🎉
Such an awesome achievement! Congrats on your success and transformation.
Awesome congratulations"	x55szk	trans	1224	0.99	2022-09-03 21:49:44
am I going crazy? stepping into the comments with all of the upvotes and downvotes flipped is absurd		"Turns out the general public actually aren't nearly as transphobic as people think. Most people just don't really care. The ones that do get all riled up. I'm convinced trans acceptance is at an all time high and will continue it's trajectory. We're under fire BECAUSE we're visible and being accepted and the bigots are terrified of losing control
Depends on the sub, for some reason this was a good post/sub.

But make the mistake of stepping foot into a meme subreddit (dankmemes/memes/etc) and oh boy what a trip
That sub skews very left. And I’ve seen the mods take strong stances against transphobia. Just goes to show not everyone is against us!
bit jarring to see that sub and others actually speaking out against this crap.
Another post about a similar topic on that reddit had the same happen. My comments + others got upvoted and transphobic stuff got downvoted.
FORCED FCKING DETRANSITION

I feel the strong urge to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* the people that decided that.
I follow her on Twitter and literally posted about her the other day.
It's seeing comments like that keep me alive. I'm so worn out by constant casual transphobia, sometimes even from other trans people. It creates this hopeless feeling.
Hey to any trans minors in these states you might be able to transition out of state. I know this is true for Utah. You most likely will have to pay without insurance though.
I mean there's more support than hate but there's still a LOT of transphobic circle jerking. Hell I saw someone with like -30 downvotes because they literally just asked someone to prove their bullshit
Considering the terminating treatment could lead to, and honestly . . . being force fed detransition when youre you for the first time . . . and if there was depression before . . . I'd they cared so much about harm they wouldn't be doing this. 

Anyone pushing any government dictated medical decisions should be immediately thrown out of office and into a prison.

This is horrific. Like can they even understand the damage they ARE doing or do they only care about damage that can be done if treatment is stopped immediately?

I'm not even sure why I'm saying this it's not like anyone who doesn't already know all this is paying attention to anything we say.

These people are zealous in their desire to purge us.

I just hope the families of those affected by this will do the right thing and move somewhere safe. I can't think of where would be safe though?
I've had friends moving out of California which seems like a safe state but the price of living, environmental issues, crime, all of that just makes that not good. 

New York? I don't know where else. I'm in Utah . . . I want out of Utah. I'm in the US, I want out of the US. 

I'd suggest we just make a new nation for trans people and family and friends who would rather move to a new nation than live in one built on the principals of religious persecution . . . but they would just use that as a way to wipe us all out easily with a WMD.

They're evil. Evil and heartless and thoughtless and cruel.
America is falling apart, let's just claim Scotland as our own
Really not surprised at this being passed in South Dakota.  Their government, and a lot of other aspects of life there, is in the dark ages.  It is the reddest of red states, you think Desantis is bad, go look at Kristi Noem, she's scary.  South Dakota is my home state and there are parts of it I really like, but it is one of the most dangerous places for anyone trans or queer to live.
I've seen this as well. The comments are mostly not against Trans, at least as I've seen it. Most people at least realize that human rights are stripped away. But my comment there has been downvoted af. I see it as a beginning of a slow genocide against Trans, even if they seem to disagree
Sock puppets and bots. The support genuinely outnumbers the hate, but it’s known that transphobes will resort to sock puppets and botting to make them look more reasonable.
Welp, time to go beat up Kristi noem
“this is the land of the free, and we have so much freedom” meanwhile, daily shootings with regular mass shootings and school shootings with the government not sorting out gun control. Government actively trying to wipe out trans people and take rights and bodily autonomy away from anyone this is not a white cisgender male. Oh and did I mention a seriously awful reputation with every police force across the country. 

Land of the free…you’ve got to be joking!
just wow i hate this country 😭
That is horrible....
Pretty sure a guy I went to high school with helped with this shit. Rep. John Hansen. That place was so hard to grow up in. He seemed like a cool, nerdy, theatre and music kid when we were friends. Bummer. Such ignorance and hate.
I'm so scared
im in florida seeing shit like this jusy makes me piss my pants its so scary like genuinely 😭
Scrolled through that’s last night and their was a ton of transphobia did they moderate it?
What age is being defined as ""youth""?
You know it’s weird that these bans don’t just effect trans kids. Cis people need hormones all the fucking time.
Looks like North Dakota is the better Dakota now.
Uhm.. this has to do with minors.. you guys aren't paying attention to the whole thing.. :/
I’m confused, what do you mean upvotes and downvoted being flipped? I don’t see anything weird for that sub
What the actual fuck
That's horrible!
Soon the cis won't have bodily autonomy either, it's a slippery slope.
I hope people start to become concerned about the Republican Party taking their rights away: pregnancy, books, transgender care, privacy, educational choices, etc..
^(Good god these right-wing freaks are evil.)
even if i ever am able to come out will i even be allowed to transition?
What. The. Actual. Fuck.  They're saying that we're trying to force others to transition? This is so fucked up! I'm sure this bullshit is going to be rolled out in here Texas soon, too.
and they say we force transition on people 🙄
I've been thinking lately it has to do with declining birth rates and the ruling class being terrified of having a smaller surplus population to exploit. They got rid of Roe v Wade and immediately started going after gender non conformists. I'd bet their end goal is returning women to the role of property
I think Reddit skews young, and young skews left.
It's an uphill battle, but so is riding your bike up a hill. Just because it's an uphill battle doesn't mean it's a losing one.
I feel like there's some aspects of being trans that the average person is still uncomfortable with. I.e. trans people in sports, and change room access. But they still want to allow us to exist and the genocide being proposed my many states bothers them as much as it bothers us.
We are under fire because transphobes are starting to realize nothing else is working and transphobia is literally all they have left, and even that’s not working
r/memes & r/dankmemes users trying not to be racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic challenge (Impossible)
Even r/funny is dominated by turbo cringe transphobia
r/polls is pretty terrible too.
Really? It doesn't surprise me iirc there's always a top post regarding the latest in social justice
Yep im the one who posted this. It was really good until it hit the front page….. then the awful comments came rushing in. And of course awful comments got like 50 upvotes because all the transphobes sort by controversial
Erin is the best
and in the cases where you need to pay without insurance USE GOODRX. it’s used in place of insurance and it has literally saved me over $1,500 in the mere 2 months i’ve been on T.
Luckily minnesota is an amazing hub of transgender resources so hopefully it'll be accessible. Still we've seen a lot of legitimately fascist moves from South Dakota, like the courts blatantly overturning a referendum vote for legal cannabis.
Don’t lose hope…
You can come to Europe. 
There are some places, where you will be safe…
So you're against private gun ownership because of mass shootings but also think the government is trying to wipe you out? You might want to think things through a bit more.
Oh nice they did that’s sick
It's anyone under 18 from what I understand.
I think they mean that whenever they see a trans post in another subreddit that isn’t dedicated to the trans community, usually all pro trans comments get downvoted and anti trans posts get upvoted. For this post however, it’s actually pro trans.
Overall it's about restoring things the way they were when the US was not a unified country. Basically, they seem to be trying to go back to how it was when slavery was legal, women where only in the kitchen, and so on. The civil war never ended it just moved into the political chairs and now the crazies that dream of the past are hammering hard at it. At least this is how it has seemed the past decades.

And birth rates wouldn't be suffering so much if they actually gave a shit about people instead of making certain they stay under the poverty line and kept making it so people can't afford medical care.
I don't think that's the case. If they were concerned with having a smaller surplus population they wouldn't oppose immigration.
Nah that’s white replacement, not classism.
I think people attribute too much monolithic thinking to “the ruling class” transphobia isn’t a new concept, people have been hateful against anybody different for a long time. Jim Bob in Arkansas didn’t just get his transphobia chip triggered by the elite because they want a surplus of exploitable labor.
Handmaids tale anyone?
Yes, and I think largely because of military numbers. Less unwanted babies? Less military recruits. Smaller military? We fall to Russia, China, or whoever notices we’re “weaker” first
And all under the guise of Christian love... when people force their personal beliefs on others which they learned in Sunday ""school"" instead of scientific factual evidence presented by highly educated, intelligent, experienced, professionals that have spent decades doing the work you have to question wtf is actually going on. The answer to 99 questions out of 100 in America is money.
I agree with you, but I also don't. It's about the area. 99% of teens here (where I live) are right leaning, they get it from their parents.
IIRC (I unfortunately don't have a source) millennials are actually becoming *more* left leaning as they get older.
Not just young most millennials are skewed left as well
Right, it's kind of like that period of time when public opinion of gay men became ""well as long as they don't try anything with me, whatever"".  Will some people talk shit behind your back? Absolutely.  But it's definitely better.
r/dankmemes has been getting better, r/memes used to be ok and is now spiraling into political circlejerking.

(Also not saying r/dankmemes is good, but from my observations hateful posts are starting to get less upvotes.)
I love it that reddit keeps trying to push r/memes on me no matter how much I rebuke that one. Incredibly jarring to be just scrolling through my normal stuff and ope! Here's some driveby bigotry from a subreddit you never subscribed to in your life!
or AITA, TwoXChromosomes, ... the list goes on
Yup, that one's awful too - pushed on me via algorithm just as often as r/memes is and it's almost always transphobic content thrown onto my feed.
I think they meant actively supporting trans rights - many of the subs that aren’t queer-related on here are intensely transphobic.
Yea but her constant posting made me feel terrified.
I dont know if I can. I'm on disability and I know some countries don't like that.
Honestly the fact that I'm in this community is one of the reasons I will never give up my guns. Gotta have a method of self defense.
“Gun control” never said get rid of them. Although place like the UK manage a lot better than the US! But the US is in such a state with too many people having access to guns that taking them all away would never happen. Also it’s wrong that people can go to their supermarket and buy a gun. Like seriously it needs to be controlled a lot more. 

You may want to learn to read before you start spewing off BS. And yes the US and UK government are trying to take steps to get rid of trans people and prevent us from being able to access care.
They seriously, how can you go through, so many school shootings and mass shootings and seriously not want more gun control. Kids are scared to go to school with the fear that they gonna get shot. Is that not reason enough for better gun control?
Oh I see, that makes sense, though I’m not too surprised that tfm is like that, it’s a pretty good sub
Its easier to exploit immigrants in their home countries.

Also, they want to keep America as white as possible.

Xenophobia is one hell of a drug.
American capitalists exploit workers worldwide. They don't actually care which country as long as the laws don't protect the workers. The massive amount of hate from the politicians is performative to rile up their target demographic and distract them from what actually causes their problems
not true—they would much rather be able to procreate and multiply “their own” than accept immigrants into the country. we’re gonna revert to cousin fucking and marital r*pe being legalized in all 50 in the next 20 years if they get their way.
The caveat there is *white surplus
Being denied access to wealth, reasonable healthcare, pensions, reasonable housing, career advancement, etc will do that.
Yep, we got cheap houses in 2008-09, but most of us still have student debt, getting paid horrid wages, getting forced into shit contract jobs, and paying $500+ a month for healthcare. How does one not get depressed?
I can anecdotally vouch for this. I went from enthusiastically voting for Obama to ""eat the rich"" and watched nearly all of my contemporary friends do the same. Turns out that when you live through multiple ""unprecedented events"" that wind up screwing over the average person, and see even something as humble as ""you know, I'd like to have a small one bedroom home with a modest yard and a car"" become laughable pipe dreams, it kinda radicalizes you.
Millennials are young I can’t believe you’d do me like this
I just press the 3 dots and mute the subreddit. But yeah, I had a alt account and wasn’t happy about the low key transphobic bs I saw. It’s fucking hilarious though how often they will portray themselves as the gigachad while being transphobic when they probably have never went to college, got an actual job, pursued a career, or worked on themselves a day in their lives.
What's the problem with TwoXChromosomes? I've always known it to be quite good (ironically, considering the name of the sub).
Oh, really? I've always seen support- that's why i love it here. Maybe I'm just on the good side of reddit lol
Ya... Sometimes I'm torn between being ignorant and happy, and informed but terrified.
Yup. I always laugh at how the same people who advocate gun control can post about cops beating black people or the trail of tears right after.
Why would it matter where the guns are sold if the same checks are done either way? Got your stabbin' loicense?
No, it's reason for better security in school. How can you see so many instances of the government murdering minorities during traffic stops and think it's a good idea to let them be in charge of our safety?
You can only take advantage of illegal immigrants so long as they remain illegal immigrants.
In that case they wouldn't be concerned about a population shortage. Global population is still increasing
Well globally population is increasing still
Agree to disagree. The ruling class doesn't care about ""their own"" and they aren't particularly religious. The culture war stuff is just to fire up lunatic white nationalists to keep them in power. I highly doubt they actually care. People with actual power are insulated from stuff like that
I'm 34. Do you want to go try to keep up with a someone who is 21?
I'm a zoomer and I will be 23 this April. You're getting old.

Thanks to you all though I didn't grow up with delusions of the world being fair and things being affordable. I'm prepared for the world to fuck me until I'm drained of every ounce of my worth and get nothing for it. I yearn for the inevitable doom on the horizen to colaps in so hard it drags the people who think they're imune to it off their golden pedastools kicking and screaming.

38 here.

According to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, more than half of my country are younger than me. 😂
Yeah, their rules are explicitly trans inclusive and I haven't noticed anything awful (yet).
It's about 50/50 on blatant misandry. Not near FDS levels, but still...
Yea its definitely a problem but it's important to be informed on what states are doing the worst and making sure to avoid them
Yeah but it’s not like you are gonna go round shooting them everytime they do something wrong. Also gun control is way more than some racist criminal cops.
Your a joke. You realise people are dying everyday because guns are not properly controlled. America is in just a state at the moment that people look at America as a joke cause the government is weak and constantly wish for thoughts and prayers when adults and children die from being shot instead of actually doing something about it. Meanwhile police are trigger happy and frankly a large majority are racist. Also meanwhile the government are actively removing women’s ability to have control of their body and safe practices for abortion. Oh and also actively trying to remove rights and healthcare to trans people. Need a say more. I’m not saying other counties are also having issues but nowhere is on par with the US. 
America needs to stop fighting guns with more guns and do something about gun control and any other opinion about it is ridiculous. Nothing is going to improve if things don’t change.
They are concerned about a white people shortage.  Have you ever heard of the Great Replacement conspiracy?
34 is still young by pretty much any measure except absolute elite athletics. You're in your prime!
i’m in my early sixties and i do it every day for my job. it’s not easy.
Trust me we are in much the same boat. I'm just glad you were able to be prepared to hit that brick wall prepared and not destroyed by the sheer realization that what you had been pushed to achieve and reality were so different.
Ok I was kidding around bc I’m over 40 lol, but 34 is legit young, not even joking. I wish I’d known how young I was in my early 30s! Although I recently heard an 80yo looking at pics from his 60s saying “Jeez we were young” so maybe we’re all younger than we think until it’s too late…
Well that and know what policies they'd like to implement nation wide if they get their way.
Someone starting spitting numbers at me about the declining white population as if it was supposed to terrify me and I was just like “who cares? There will still be humans… why aren’t you this riled up about the extinction of entire species?”
Yes but the ruling class aren't adherents to great replacement. The ruling class isn't concerned about that, their wealth insulates them anyway. The rhetoric is just used to rile up the people that actually care about the race shit. Modern racism was invented as a way for the ruling class to enslave Africans and force them to do jobs for cheaper than they could pay peasants. To keep the peasants from having solidarity with the Africans they invented the idea that the enslaved people were less than people to create division. So basically, the ruling class isn't actually racist, they just use racism as a tool to divide workers
Im aware. I still like poking fun though
That I can believe much respect to you
At 100 he’ll be saying the same thing about being 80
I'd step up with a coalition to stop anything nation wide.
How'd they respond?  Just curious
The problem is enough people treat there political affiliation as so much of an identity they literally don't care what policies are being proposed they're guaranteed to vote for them.

I just got misgendered. It's sad how these things can ruin a perfect night. I wish I wasn't so affected by this, I feel so weak sometimes..		"How would someone misgender you looking like that???? Must have dementia or smth
You look’s so beautiful
Wait how on earth were you misgendered?  You look like a cis woman to me.  In fact you look very similar to my Auntie.
How in the actual fuck were YOU misgendered?!
You look fabulous hon, I think it was likely just a slip up. I've called my male teacher mom before. Sometimes things just slip by accident. I think it's just that our dysphoria sometimes amplifies all references to that

I had a moment today myself. While getting ready to go out for dinner, I saw my partner getting dressed in the bathroom and noticed she had on a shirt that I also happen to have, so I wore the same color pants, and the exact same shirt. I waited in the bedroom for her to come it and yelled ""twinsies!"" He reaction was ""Ah really?? Well, I'll have my sweater on anyways"". I quietly removed my shirt after she left the room and threw it in the trash. I proceeded to put on a very gender-neutral t-shirt instead. I tried to hide the fact I was crying inside, but it was obvious I went from my normal cheerful self to a sad mess. Thankfully, I told her during dinner and she apologized and assured me it had nothing to do with me dressing like her ""in that way"" (since I told her I was feeling dysphoric about it), it was just that she was getting prettied up and got caught off guard that I matched her... dunno, but it can definitely get to me even for the small and subtle queues

Hope you feel better about it soon ❤
To people who say ""I call *EVERYONE* bro."" 

That's cool. Hey,  I call *EVERYONE*  Rocky Dennis. Don't be mad, when I say this I'm being ""gender neutral"" & I ""mean no harm"" 

Yes. This is how that argument sounds🙄
I don’t see anyone but a lady!🌸
God, I know exactly how you feel. And it feels deliberate when you completely pass 😭Happened to me today too, I’m so sorry. Sending virtual hugs.
Wait… how did that happen!? Is the person blind?
You are so beautiful!
Even when it's not meant with ill intent, I swear these words related to our agab are the loudest. I hate it. Try and remember intent when it happens. x.x
Anyone misgendering you is doing so intentionally to be cruel.  If you let it bother you the transphobes win
It's ok, you aren't weak people just suck. You look great btw 💕
Girl you look beautiful, I love your hair ❤️
Holy shit, how?! Youre looking fabulous!
You literally look cis omg how did someone misgender you, you're gorgeous??
You're a beautiful women <3
Why someone can misgender you?,you look pretty feminine to pass
I don't want to pretend i know how that feels, but i can say i know how it feels when someone says something hurtful and/or demeaning.

I look myself in the mirror, deep into my own beautiful eyes in the morning and say ""I love you"" "" No one else can define me"" "" I am confident"" ""I am loved"" ""I am accepted"".

The affirmation in the morning has built up confidence in me where as before I couldn't even look at myself for more than second.

I truly hope this doesn't slow you down. 
You ARE a beautiful woman. You ARE loved! You are just as worthy and deserving as anyone else. 

Pick up the bike and start riding again!
How???? How TF did they misgender YoU????
\*big-sis-hug\*
I think you are very beautiful
Sorry to hear that 😞
How tf can you look at someone like you and think MAN?! btw is that tattoo Hebrew? Sry if it’s a wired question it just looks like Hebrew letters
You are beautiful. That is all that matters.
You are not weak! Being trans makes you the strongest woman in the world ❤️❤️❤️
You are an stunningly beautiful woman. What is sad is how utterly shitty some people can be. What it really is is a reflection of how crappy they feel about themselves. Nobody with good self-esteem goes around trying to hurt people like that. You're stronger than you realise. Just having the strength to be who you really are and not what other people say you should be is a clear sign of that. Keep your head up girl xx
How???
Jeez, I'd never misgender you. That's for sure. I would never ever even think that you are not cis... But if it makes your hurt any less, I'm a cis female and I get misgendered myself every once in a while 😅 and I can't say that I'm too masculine or something. If I show you my pic I'm sure you'd agree. I'm what they call a tomboy. Try not to take this personally, maybe that guy has poor eyesight. You look gorgeous btw🌷🔥😊 hugs🤗
I feel you. Just dont know how posting a selfie online will help
You aren’t even the slightest masculine or even look like a man. You pass so well and I’m deeply sorry they misgendered you. You’re absolutely gorgeous
You’re beautiful! So sorry that you were hurt. I hope you took some space to heal. 💕
Oh that person was just being a tit.

Don't let some bigot intentionally get you down. Appreciate your beauty and let their lameness be the nail in their coffin.
I feel like we should misgender them back lmao see how they feel
 are you sure it's real? They/ she looks like a female to me.

Years ago I used to think a lot of people were calling me names behind my back and they weren't really doing it
Look at you. I’d bet you didn’t get misgendered (mistaken for the wrong gender), you got antigendered (called the wrong thing on purpose to upset you - a distinction I just made up words for right now on the spot.)
I am sorry but no...

That person was either blind, mentally disabled or just plain weird.

If you get misgendered then these is no hope for any of us. 

You are fucking gorgeous and you should know that by now ;)
Dm me
It’s not weakness to feel bad when someone doesn’t actually even see you, it feels bad when someone conjures up an idea of who you are and puts it on you.
😢
You’re not weak for feeling hurt when someone does something hurtful. You’re strong for living your life authentically in spite of the pain. 🖤
Well take this to heart,from Florida of all hellscapes. You have a good night ma'am. And your dress does seriously good things for your eyes
I’m sorry you had that happen to you. I think you’re pretty though
You have natural beauty
Okay so this might not help but I was scrolling and thought this was a celebrity page and you were Paget Brewster (she plays Emily Prentiss from criminal minds and I always thought she was really pretty.) then I saw the caption and was like “Huh. Wow they’re really pretty.” 

So you’re definitely a beautiful and strong woman and you deserve to be properly gendered.
I see a beautiful woman.
You're beautiful girl! I'm sorry that happened to you. It sucks that people think they have to be such assholes especially to total strangers. Be strong. You're better than him. Much love hon
Sorry sweetie your beautiful
They must have been blind. All I see is a totally beautiful woman.
How???? 

I mean, I just don't see it.....
My fiance checks reviews before going anywhere. But seriously? You're beautiful! WTF is wrong with them?
I don’t understand how people can be so cruel. I know this has you down but don’t stay there you are to precious to this world. You have people that love you. You are beautiful and I feel you have a kind and loving heart.  I can see it in your photo…
Happens to a lot of us! I had it the other day. A man in a wheel chair said ‘gosh you’re tall’ I replied ‘I am wearing heels today. His wife was beside me as I was trying to pass by walking (they were blocking the walkway as there was an assistant there too) I was walking kinda behind/ beside his wife but I didn’t get a good look at her and her me. But she said to her husband ‘he’s wearing heels.. I mean she!’ I was like Jesus two in one and I was just about to start work. I’ve just had voice surgery too, we have to have hard skin xxx
Girl you look so beautiful just whip that hair back wards and walk away like the boss bitch you are.
Maybe a voice thing? If your driver said it, I’m assuming you were sitting in the back seat having a convo
Hun your beautiful and just so pretty /p
How did you get misgendered??? You pass so perfectly not to mention whoever that was probably misgender you on purpose, what a idiot.
The cab driver.. it wasn’t Ill intended, what kinda hurts even more.. he instinctively said “thanks brother”..
😊 thank u
Next time don't trash your stuff so fast <3
Exactly 🙄
that's not the same but ok
Maybe it’s my voice.. I don’t know
Muito obrigada
Thank you 😊 🥰
I think it was My voice probably…
Thank you so much for the kind words. I can see a lack of self love sometimes… You r right… We need to build it everyday.
Muito obrigada ☺️ you r very kind
I’m feeling better today. I was feeling like shit yesterday.
Yes, It’s Hebrew . From the kabbalah
Thank you 😊
Ow thank you. We really are brave.
Wow 😮 that is so true. Thank you for reminding of that. These communities rocks. I’m receiving so much good advices. It really help to see things with a better perspective.
Cab driver.
Lol That was so funny to read .. made me smile, thank you..And thanks a lot for sharing your life experiences.
It helped a lot. I was feeling like shit yesterday. But received so many advices n shared experiences. I’m feeling much better today. Great community here 💕
Thank you very much for your comment! It helped a lot 🥰💕
I've done that a few times before and they don't like that especially in front of other people.
Hahahaha that is a fuckn great idea 💡! 😆
[removed]
Good to know that. I never heard the term antigendered. Thanks for sharing 😊
hey as an autistic person, please don't use ""mentally disabled"" as an insult, thanks
Nah, I know the culture most cab/Uber drivers come from. They see us as filth
Crap, I use dude alot. I'll do better!
Im sorry your hurt and I've been through similar. I just want to ask if it could have been a gender neutral ""brother"". I've been called guy, bro, and dude, but after a while of thinking about it I think they meant it in more of a gender neutral way. Im not saying it doesn't hurt or anything, just thought maybe this could be the case?
if it makes you feel better, i call most of my cis girl friends ""bro"" and ""man""
Ah so it was just a reflex, that’s still annoying though
Omg those ones, I always ‘forget’ to shut the door when I leave
people use bro, dude and stuff like that all the time for everyone. Its just slang the cab drive is used to saying, and i 100% guarantee you he says that to cis women too. you're over thinking it
that's the way young people talk today. I don't think he meant you were a man I think he ment to be friendly
Your welcome mami
I took it out of the trash after, and it's sitting safely in the laundry basket now 😇
🙄
you definitely don't look like a man at all. Have you done any voice training or checked out /r/transvoice ?
Absolutely can say in this photo you 100% pass. You’re gorgeous. I’ve had a cab driver misgender me once. I ended up just asking him why he did and he said at first he didn’t know I was trans, but my voice gave it away.

At least the voice is trainable, but being misgendered still hurts. I’m working on caring less about it and learning to accept myself in whatever shape or form I am as being me, regardless of gender. It’s just too stressful to deal with people (especially family) who just constantly misgender me. Then internalizing that and thinking there’s something wrong with my presentation (because “obviously” if I passed perfectly they wouldn’t do that).

If I get a he or him now and again, I try to remind myself that I’m a beautiful and kind person no matter what. And for the vast majority of other interactions where I get a she or her, I try to be grateful. It’s a long road we take that goes on for the rest of our lives. I only expect that one day you’ll just forget when the last time you got misgendered was. Then you can flash a little smile to yourself because you made that happen.
I'm glad. Thank you for sharing
Why thank you
Dam... way to be a dickhead lmao at least get there gender right, sure they may have a penis but if they present as a women refer to them as a women. Its just polite at least. And if it was just a mistake soneone made cool they happen. But if your dress up in more famine cloths asking would be the better route. Again tho cant blane people for mistakes but theres ways to avoid them. Ill shut up now before i drag it out to long
Yeah, me neither - but I needed a word to express the difference between accidental and malicious misgendering. I think I’d have to be malicious to misgender you!
Hey as a person with and schizophrenia. Should I have put severally in front to emphasize my point that only someone who would not be fully aware of their surroundings could make such a mistake? 

It's like walking on eggshells on the subreddit sometimes
Yeah. Maybe you r right. I may be overwhelmed by other stuff.. that was just the last drop.
I wonder too. I have three teens (2 girls 1 boy) (1 trans) and they use bro, dude, bruh and sometimes now dickhead 😡 for each other regardless of who it’s for.
No. Brother isn't gender neutral, ‘bro’ is pushing it.
Thank you anyway. It was really good to talk about it.
No they don't say it to cis women, it's usually ‘thanks darling’ followed by some creepy compliment.
They usually don't say it,  if you're over 50
🥰😺
Never done. Really thinking about it now ..
Thank you all guys! Lots of positive vibes here. ✨
or maybe, just maybe, don't use mental disability as an insult? if you don't care then good for you, that doesn't mean the rest of us don't.
Even if it was intended as gender neutral, it doesn't change how much it hurts you. But I will say, if he clocked you at all, if he thought there was a chance you were a trans woman, he probably would not have said it.
Hey it's alright. I guarantee you this is a common and okay feeling
I 100% use bro for everyone.
I use bro or dude for everyone. Maybe that was his case?
I have been working on it, but I use dude for everyone! It is a gender-neutral term in my area. For as long as I can remember, women have been calling women, dude. And men have been calling men dude, and everyone in between has been calling everyone in between dude. lol

It is an extremely hard habit to break. But I'm trying to be better about it because I know I may accidentally cause someone distress, and I don't want to do that.

BTW, you look awesome, and that color looks really good on you!
It likely was meant as gender neutral but it’s still not cool and I’m so sorry they did something to hurt you. You’re beautiful and I hope you have a better night 💜
Maybe not in your area. My sister's and i have all been called brother. And bro
That’s good, you’re so beautiful!
one fun thing about it is that it will also give you a nicer singing voice since you can hit more notes 😀
 i'm sure you mean well, but please consider how it affects a lot of us trans women tho, as you can see from this post, even when  you intend it as neutral, we don't know that and it can hurt. also reinforces patriarchy so there's that. but hey i'm not trying to tell you how to live your life . and please don't take this as an attack, just telling you how it makes me feel
Maybe.. I’m more sad for let it get into me . You know? I wish I could just don’t care that much.
Are you American?
I apreciate the feedback, I'll think on it. Ty
\+1
Hey so it makes total sense that this would effect you. I think most of us get taken back receiving a misgendering comment while we are out in public. Personally when I'm misgendered it ramps up my anxiety because  I worry about my safety. 

I have a long history with being bullied so my defense mechanism was to ""blend in"". Any time I stick out in random crowds I struggle to manage my emotional reaction. Luckily through therapy I've been able to manage this much better but it will always be a bit of an issue. 

Typically the reaction comes from the interaction hitting a core vulnerability that we have. Trying to identify that and finding coping strategies around that can be helpful.
Hey, you've figured out a problem with yourself and I see that as a win. Now that you've isolated the problem, you can now work on it. Everyone has thin skin about something and when you isolate what you have thin skin about, you can use that as a pathway to self improvement."	11o7y96	trans	1093	0.99	2023-03-11 02:09:30
Homeless Transgender Teen Update.	"TW: Suicide mention, death. 

**Posted on Eli's personal account to raise awareness.**

 Hey everyone. I have some really tragic and sad news that I wanted to share, because I know he made somewhat of an impact on this community, and r/LGBT, with a popular post back in January 2022. Long story short, my best friend, Eli Milo \[Last Name\] passed away tragically on March 27th. He was also known as u/affterdark here on Reddit. I’m only sharing this account here because his Instagram, Facebook and other socials were all private. I’ve redacted his last name and other details for privacy concerns. But I didn’t want to leave Eli’s story without an update. So here it is. I will be posting this both on my account and on Eli’s to get his message across. 

In early January of this year, Eli shared his story of being kicked out for being transgender, leaving him homeless in Canada. Reddit blew up his post and reached out with SO MANY resources for him, which was extremely helpful in beginning the emancipation process from his abusive, unsupportive parents. My mother and I housed him for a few weeks, albeit less than legally, before a shelter’s emergency housing for youth accepted him, and moved him in. He began to see a therapist at the end of February, who advised him to start HRT to improve his quality of life.  

He was also diagnosed with a paranoid anxiety disorder and suicidal ideation as well as depression. You’d never know it because of how sweet, caring, passive, loving, and kind he was. Eli’s parents (one of which was a police officer) were going through a negotiation process with him to keep him out of the foster care system. We didn’t get to see where it went before the shelter called us to inform us that he was missing and hadn’t checked in that night. 

In the afternoon of March 27th, Eli’s body was discovered. I will not be specifying how, but Eli’s death was a suicide. My heart is still broken and reeling knowing that. Eli texted me hours prior but nothing was out of the ordinary. The entire situation made him horribly depressed, which added to his paranoia. It was made worse when someone began to inbox him with messages asking about his personal information, asking about his parents and where they worked, despite Eli constantly saying that he didn’t want any personal information getting out because he had two younger siblings at home. He was always so caring, so worried for them and having an income to support them despite his parents homophobic and transphobic nature towards him. He showed me a few messages and instances of this happening. One person didn’t respect that and apparently, ended up calling the Regina police service to report Eli’s situation, with the intention of getting Eli’s siblings placed into foster care and his parents imprisoned. I think that was his breaking point. I want to mention that his little siblings ARE stable as of now. 

Eli was my best friend since we were both 12. We spent many nights, holidays, and summers over at each other’s houses as well as inside and outside of school together. When he came out to me as transgender, I was extremely excited about the authenticity in which he expressed himself- I couldn’t wait to see where his life was taking him. We confided in each other, played together, talked about everything together, and spent so much time together. It feels like my heart is missing without him. He was such a prominent part of my life that being without him feels horribly surreal. 

Eli lived a short life at only 16, and was five months away from his 17th birthday. My mother contacted Eli’s parents after the police contacted them, both via school and via the shelter he was staying at (we were his emergency contacts at the shelter.) His parents don’t want anything to do with the funeral, but wanted him buried, a cultural thing. Eli’s parents gave us $200, but that wouldn’t be enough to even cover it. I might give a couple more updates as they come about regarding Eli’s funeral. My mother and I desperately want to  name displayed after his death. I know this isn’t the update that anyone wanted, and for that I’m so sorry. 

But everyone who reached out touched Eli’s soul in a profound way. Thank you so much for all your support and prayers, kindness and compassion, and love for Eli and his story. I don’t have the heart to privately message everyone that reached out to Eli, it would make me too sad. It means everything to me, it meant so much to him. From the bottom of my heart and Eli’s, Thank you. 

Edited to add: We'd like to raise money via GoFundMe, but there's some legal details I'm still trying to figure out (Like how to make one despite not owning a credit card.) If you can, you are still able to donate via my PayPal or through my bank as well to fund for Eli's funeral expenses and a headstone with his preferred name on it. If you choose to donate, I can't thank you enough.  Please direct message me/inbox me for the details. 

Another Edit: I have found one of the last threatening messages that Eli received before his death, and it’s been posted to this sub for those who messaged me asking for an update.

-Jasper, Eli’s best friend."	"The parents aren't even gonna do the funeral, i hate this world sometimes
Fuck those parents who won't even do a funeral for their child. Fuck them

Sometimes the world fucking sucks
My deepest condolences. I can’t even begin to comprehend how heart wrenching this must be.
Honoring him by even trying to get his funeral planned is so sweet.

They're very expensive and I wish I had the money to contribute. 

Suicides can be the hardest form of loss a person can go through, so please take care of yourself. 

You knew him well, he can live through you and the impact he made on you. 

Im sorry, I dont know what more to say. My heart goes out to you. I really hope you're doing ok, all things considered. 

Also, thanks for posting this. You're a really good friend.
I’m so so sorry. Please let us know if there’s anything we can do to support you as you grieve. We will miss him, a massive loss for the whole world. May his soul be at peace
Fucking Christ. Parents are so stuck up that they won't go to their child's funeral? What the fuck... I'm so sorry, this... God, I have no words, this must be such a fucking... You know that bottomless pit feeling in your stomach, of just emptiness? This is that. Rest in peace, Eli. You didn't deserve the life you had, and I wish it could've been so much better.
I don’t know what to say, except-sorry for your loss. I know it’s heartbreaking to lose someone, no matter who or what they are. Stay strong, and try to help people facing the same situation as Eli. 

It must really hurt for you right now though, so take a mental break. Please.

Good luck!
I’m so so sooooo sorry. I don’t even know what to say
Wow. The parents are something else. Like they won't even cover the funeral... Jesus. Silver lining, at least poor Eli won't be buried under his dead name.

you, op... You are wonderful. You are a shining example of what humanity should be like. You were truly supportive of Eli, and have been the best friend he could hope for. 

Condoléances, this story is beyond tragic.
The worst possible outcome
I am so so sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing his story with us. May Eli RIP and be remembered for the beautiful person he was🤍🏳️‍⚧️🕊
I am so sorry. You should be glad that you were there to love him during his life. I have no words, I don’t know how someone can do something like this to their son.
So many horrible people in the world. Those parents should be arrested for neglect towards their child.
I’m so so sorry for your loss, and I know that doesn’t even begin to cover it. Eli was a wonderful, amazing, strong person, and he is and will be missed. Losing your best friend feels like losing a part of yourself, and you should feel free to take all the time you need to grieve. My dms are open if you need to talk about him or anything else.

When my best friend passed away, this song was and still is amazing. Music is a good way to remember people.

Rest in peace and power, Eli.
May he be at rest, and at peace, wherever he is.

I offer you my condolences. Even after everything that happened to him, you can sleep knowing that he had a good friend, a best friend, in his life.
Why do some people even have children and treat them like that when the Child is not like they wanted it to be
People try to tout trans suicide rates, but they dont seem to understand how painful it is to have your own parents disown you and see you as a monster for something out of your own control. My deepest condolences.
Oh my gods. This is absolutely awful.......
Poor Eli...

OP- I'm glad Eli had a friend like you. I can't imagine how difficult his life was with those animals for parents.
Wow, I can't believe his parents are that morally bankrupt.

Are we sure it's a good idea for those siblings to stay with their parents? I mean, those parents drove their own son to suicide. 

This is so heartbreaking. You're such a wonderful human being for being so helpful, and I hope you know that you didn't have anything to do with what happened. You tried your best and that's all that mattered. 

I hope you find your piece. I lost a friend to suicide when he was 14, because his zealot religious dad wouldn't listen to his problems... So this just hits close to home.

Stay strong, you're irreplaceable.
I remember reading the original post, I remember hoping that everything will turn out fine for him. When I read what happened I cried. Not only one of us suicided,but also because of those terrible ""parents"". It's so sad and unfortunate that because of stupid ideology people don't care about fate of their children
Heartbreaking 💔 my very deepest condolences 💐 may peace be with you and your family! You are kind souls!
I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a friend is one of the hardest things we have to experience in life and I'm sorry it had to be like this. Your memories of the time you spent together will live on and his influence will persist through what you do with your life. I hope he is finally at peace after having lived through those painful experiences leading to his end. This is too common in our community but it never gets less sad.
This is one of those ""worst case scenario"" timelines. And unfortunately there will be no redemption for anyone. I hope Eli's parents are given the slums of their hell for doing this.
I'm sorry, Eli sounded like a very good person trying to make the best of the hand they were dealt. Lossing someone is always horrible,
I am very sorry for your loss. This world is such a cruel and heartless place sometimes. I wish you nothing but the best. Please take a moment to breathe. May Eli rest well.
i almost had a breakdown reading this, even though I didn't know this person. no one deserves that. no one at all. my deepest condolences.
:'(
😞.. May he rest in peace, this really is terrible.. It makes me so sad everytime I hear about something like this happening..
This is the end result of all the anti-trans bullshit that’s going on right now. All the hysteria and misinformation and demonizing of a microscopic number of people who already have it hard. I hope you mouthbreathers are fucking proud of yourselves. 

Just let people be who they are for Christ’s sake
I'm so sorry for your loss. If you need help funding the funeral, set up a gofundme and post the link here. Lots of people would like to contribute something to take that financial burden off of you.


If you need to talk, or just vent, we're here for you okay?

Would it be alright to include you and Eli in a prayer? (I'm not inclined to specific religion, but like to believe there is atleast Something out there that will look after our souls, when we pass)


May you be at peace Eli.

And I hope your pain eases soon Jasper.
This is terrible. I'm sorry for your loss </3
I'm so so so sorry to hear this, may they rest in peace.
Hi Jasper, I'm so sorry to hear about your friend. Eli sounds like a good guy and you were lucky to have each other. I'm sorry to hear of his passing. Even though he was a stranger it's still shitty. 

Sometimes we start to feel really weird after someone so close kills themselves so I really want to urge you to keep talking to people. Whoever it is you trust most: a parent, a sibling, another friend, a friends parent, a teacher - anyone. Suicide is difficult to recover from, sometimes for years so make sure you get any help you need, okay? We all want you to be safe. 

This place is very cool too. It's not trans specific but it is a good group of people: [www.suicideforum.com](https://www.suicideforum.com) They have forums and 24 hour chat rooms. Maybe it'll help if you find yourself struggling and want to talk to a stranger (because sometimes that's easier).
I am glad in a way that you are ones doing his funeral and not his parents- then he can be dressed and addressed in a gender-affirming way
This is truly heartbreaking. I hope Eli is in a better place and I hope his parents realize they were the only responsible for this outcome.

You are an amazing friend and Eli was so lucky to have you by his side
I'm sorry for your loss. It hurts to see how uncaring some people can be when it comes to their own flesh and blood.
Those parents deserve to be locked up in jail and never be allowed to have kids ever again.
i have no words. everything i want to say right now i know i should not. its just sad. this world is just horrible
The right wing fucks in the province have been gutting this, but Social Services should provide a basic burial 

https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/government-structure/ministries/social-services
I'm srry for your loss
I’m so sorry. What a tragic story.
I’m really sorry for your loss. It must have been awful. Wishing you the best for the future
i'm fucking sobbing
💔💔💔😭😭😭
holy shit.. the world really is a cold ugly place…
my sincerest condolences
Oh my god, that's horrible. This should never happen to anyone.
It reminded me a lot if myself tbh... Im also trans guy... But before i realized that, i still lived with mother and when i was diagnosed with autism and personality disorder, my mom just kicked me out...i had a social helper and beat friend and thanks to them i quickly found a small apartment. But fi ding job was harder because of my anxieties i just could stay in any job for too long... In the end owed my mom money for rent, i owed rent money even to landlord and soon it was clear that i have to move out. 
Around that time i already realized that im trans and i told my mom, she said its my problem, that i have to deal with it and that she is ok with it..but right after that sentenxe she started to mock me... She was already unable to call me angi when i legally renamed myself and kept calling me by my previous name all the time, so i cant imagine what she will call me once i undergo the top surgery and start talking testosterone...

Meanwhile the only place i could move out to was a house for woman without home...its a terrible place i was really scared about...so the day my mom and bff were about to come in my apartment to help me move out, i just put a bag over my head and taped it around my neck...
But i panickes when i started to lose breath and ripped the bag open with hysterical cry...i called my bff and told her what i just tried to do...she called ambulance and police and i was transported into mental hospital where i spent one month to recover. I felt like i wanna die the whole time, i just kep sleeping all day and night until the last weekend before they let me go, thats when new pills startes working and suddenly i felt happy, ready for anything and full of energy...i was suddenly ready to live in that house for homeless women and to get back on my feet...

I spent 6 months there and the maximum time you can live there is one year and meanwhile social helpers help you to find new job and home...
But around that time my bff and ger husband got covid and sadly her husband passed away...that day my bff told me to move in to her apartment because she was devastated and couldn't stay there all alone.. So it was such a bitter sweet situation for me because now the plan is that i and my bff we will live together until the end so i no longer have to look for place to live and job to do and i no longer have to be so stresses...but at what cost? I miss her husband so much because we three were very close and he was like father for me which i never had and my bff is like my mother and friend in one...its hard now as we are cleaning the apartment now, selling stuff and plan to move out because she cant get over his lost and she sees him everywhere so she wants to start over somewhere else and of course she counts me in...so yeahh...the situation for me has good ending..kinda, but i still hate that her husband had to die...i wish we all could live together...
Bless You And Your Family
I'm really sorry
Thinking about it, I involuntarily think about whether I will live more than a year or not. It's sad that things like this happen.

What monsters.
Thanks so much. My mom and I have edited the post for ways to help during this time. <3
Thank you so much. I’m overwhelmed with the positive support during this time. If I don’t respond on Eli’s account, I’ll respond here on my personal one. My mom and I have updated with ways to help during this time <3 thank you so much for thinking of us in prayer, you can totally pray for us, that would mean a lot
Absolutely.
I’m confused about what “nsa” even means. This seems like a troll comment. But there’s no “making other accept you is pointless” or “learn to make friends and see new people” that could have prevented this. This was a 16 year old who was made homeless, kicked out of his home in winter in Canada, because his parents didn’t love OR accept him for who he was. Trying to embrace and understand people, support people, love people unconditionally, is how we will heal and move forward.
If their God is real, they're going to burn.
I'm glad you get the support you need. Hang in there, okay?

If they kicked him out, I think they're going through hell everyday since then. A loss is a loss
It sounds like you’re projecting your negative coping mechanisms because of your childhood trauma on a situation that has nothing to do with you. This is a post about someone’s death, have some respect.

Am I not trans? Help!	"I have been feeling like I'm trans for some time now. I have not been getting any serious body dysphoria, but I more thrived on the verbal validation of others.

Recently, I started seeing a psychologist (not because I'm trans) and we got to the topic of gender.

Now, she asks if anything happened to me when I was younger, and I recalled living with my grandparents for a while when my baby brother was born because my mother couldn't take care of the both of us at the same time.

And then she says: ""You want to be a boy because you saw your brother getting all the attention and got jealous."" 

I'm stumped. What the fuck does this mean?? I mean, the fact that I don't get body dysphoria but if people misgender me I get sad, and then this got me thinking - am I really transgender? 

I know this sounds dumb but am I just coping and cis? When I get therapy will I magically be okay with being a woman? Are my feelings invalid because of early childhood problems?

I swear, before this I was just a happy trans man, and now I feel like my feelings are wrong, I'm lying to myself, and I'm starting to doubt myself again. This is messing with my brain, and I needed to hear the thoughts of other trans folk.

tl;dr - my psychologist told me I was trans because I was ""jealous of my brother getting my parents' attention when I was younger"", and now I'm starting to feel doubt. Any thoughts?"	"Regardless of trans stuff, that’s just bad therapy. Therapists aren’t supposed to tell you their theories flat-out, they’re supposed to let you figure it out on your own. 

OP, if this idea she gave you doesn’t resonate with you and if it doesn’t sound true, that means it almost definitely isn’t. You know yourself better than she does.
Yea nah, that's bullshit. That's borderline conversion therapy, trying to make you believe you're faking it for attention.
Thats just bad therapy. Like other said, a therapist is meant to ask the right questions to help navigate you instead of telling you their own opinions and theories. Just because theyre called a therapist that doesnt automatically make them a proper therapist.
Ummmm yeah this has actually been historically the tactic used on gay people in conversion therapy: that the only reason they are gay was from some trauma as a child. This is obviously not true, and I doubt there is really any evidence this is the case for any gay people or trans people.

I once heard someone say this on trans issues: “if you have been contemplating whether or not you are trans for a while, it means you probably are”

I’d highly recommend talking to either another therapist, or maybe just ask around here on how other trans people feel. I always find that super helpful for getting someone to figure out their own gender identity imho.
At this point i almost want to ask, does it really matter if that is the reason? You say you feel better when spoken to as a boy, for me that is enough to say ""geat then I'll speak to you as a boy"". My own journey was one of discovering the things that made me happy and then labelling came afterwards. I feel happy when binding my chest, and presenting more masc and using the words he/him, so i do just that. It doesn't matter if that makes me cis or trans. I know it can be frustrating to maybe not completely fit in with one label, but in the end, it's all about what makes you happy.
I've been in a similar situation and not having dysphoria doesn't mean you're not trans, but just take your time figuring stuff out sometimes that's all you need and if you don't, ask people for help who you feel safe with or who will accept you. I hope you find what you're looking for.
CHANGE THERAPISTS RIGHT NOW. you are so valid.
You're valid and your therapist is talking shit. I have 2 kids (1 boy, 1 girl) and can guarantee you that kids don't even see gender. My son only started saying ""that's for boys/girls"" when he heard it from other kids at age 3/4 and didn't even form an idea of gender until 5/6. My daughter is 2 and has no clue about gender. If you were 1 you would not have been able to form a conclusion that your brother got your parent's attention because ""he was a boy and you weren't"" (assigned so, at the time, sorry to kind of misgender you there but timelines make it tough). Kids are genderless, in their own mind at least (for a couple years). We gravitate towards what we like. We grow into our gender. We only deny it when society tells us we don't fit its expectations. Sorry for the essay. If you are happy as a boy, then you're a boy.
I mean it‘s easy to answer, isn‘t it? How did you feel at that time, what was it like when you were with your gramdmother?  
How did you feel when you returned home?  
Do you feel the same now?
what kinda Freudian bullshit is this lol. get a new therapist
nah thats bullshit, your valid as heck and shes a bad therapist. 

this is actually a tactic that was used by people to “convert” gay people, they make them question the validity of their identity by saying that the reason why their trans/gay mustve been created from trauma.
Gender euphoria is generally a better indicator than gender dysphoria is. What makes you feel the best? Try some stuff out and see what works. It's all about exploration. You're valid regardless of what you decide is right for you <3
That's not even proper psychology. She is incredibly transphobic, and looking for reasons to tell you it's not real.
I’m not trans… 

But holy shit can I spot a bad therapist a mile away. I don’t know you. I don’t know them.

But a session with your therapist should not have you coming to a question board for emotional therapy, AFTER your therapy session.

Find someone who respects you first.
Your therapist is trash. They often are. Find a new one.
That’s almost like conversation therapy bruh, don’t listen to it and just take your time figuring it out on your own terms or with someone who is accepting, you should really stop seeing this person cause realistically this won’t help you figure out if ur trans or not if ur with someone who by the sounds of it doesn’t like or accept trans ppl
Like others have said, that's not appropriate in therapy. Therapists don't tell you your feelings are wrong and give their version of what's going on in your brain. 

I've struggled with doubts like yours. I've never had anyone say it to my face like that, but I have wondered if I'm not trans but just frustrated with the limitations of being a woman in society (I'm definitely trans). Also 5 years ago I thought I didn't have any body dysmorphia either. I think I was not in touch with my body, because that has changed. But, either way, you don't have to have body dysmorphia to be trans. 

Accepting that you are trans is such a vulnerable position to be in that it's no wonder we doubt ourselves. It might be one of the worst aspects of being trans. Don't feel down if you doubt yourself. I've found it's helpful to think of myself as non-binary. It's true -- I do feel non-binary -- but it also really takes the pressure off of phrases like ""wanting to be a boy"" --- you just wanna be you.
I'm a psychology student. Don't take psychoanalysts (Freud's line of psychology) too seriously, they tend to try to explain what you're feeling from some bullshit occurrence from your past, even though it might not make any sense. There's some truth in trying to find things out from the past, but senseless speculation doesn't get it anywhere. It's always things that apparently make sense, but that can't be proved or disproved. Sure it makes logical sense (?), but that can't in a million years be taken as definitive proof to what you're feeling.

But there is also the possibility that your psychologist is just not educated enough on trans stuff, and that they didn't realize how harmful that comment could be. Maybe they didn't know that you're born trans, and tried to give it an explanation, but still totally support you as trans. In the sense that they were not trying to actually deny your trans identity
Nobody knows why people are trans, because it's not an easy topic. 

I know other people have said that the therapist is practicing bad therapy here, but let's hear the therapist out.

What if you are jealous of your brother and wanted to be a boy because of it? You are now an adult who feels happier as a man than you did as a woman.

That's the bit that's functional and meaningful to who you are. Nothing in your past invalidates who you feel like you are today. You are who you are, and you being a man makes you happy.
This bothers me on so many levels. As a trans person, it feels incredibly reductive to reduce something as complex and life-encompassing as identity to a single childhood incident. They're treating your trans identity as a trauma symptom, which is incredibly offensive.

As a trainee therapist, I hate hearing about counselors who allow their ideology to override their professional standards of care. This is the opposite of strengths-based and client-centered; they're treating your identity as a problem rather than a source of strength and telling you what to think rather than letting you take the lead. This person has no business working with queer clients if this is how they approach it.
completely regardless of your transness or lack thereof that is a major therapist red flag
If this were possible, there would be a *lot* more people mistakenly identifying as trans, which we just don’t see. 

You, sir, are almost certainly trans.
Yep, most people already said it, you should either change therapist or just not discuss this with her at all. Dysphoria isn't a requirement for being trans, if you feel like you are a man, then you are a man.
Even if that were true, and it sounds like bullshit, but even if that were, why would it effect who you are now? Regardless of the root cause, you still feel gender euphoria, you still enjoy being referred to as a boy and presenting as such. That doesnt change because your psychologist has a theory. Focus on who you are now, not who you might have been as a child. The child isnt living your life, you are
The best thing someone told me is that gender euphoria is much more important than dysphoria. Feeling good about where you are is much more important than feeling like where you’re at is wrong.

In regards to the therapist, either change or try new another one. If lots of them say the same thing, you might’ve been “jealous” of the attention, but there’s many more steps between “jealous of brother” and “I’m a trans man.” It’s not the “cause,” but it could have opened a new hidden perspective that opened your mind. Childhood memories manifest in mysterious ways. Just know that wanting to be a boy isn’t a bad thing.

At the end of the day, this is about you. Don’t shoehorn yourself into being cis or trans. It’s a long journey, and you can switch back and forth to find that perfect middle if needed.
Everyone else straight up shared my thoughts on gtfa from that psycho.  When I started seeing a therapist because I was worried I was only identifying as trans because I was having a manic episode or something she told me that only I could know that, but did tell me I just seemed happy and I did not seem to be presenting the symptoms of a manic episode.
You need a new therapist/psychologist. You definately are trans, and even if you weren't, that's just bad psychology. Your psychologist isn't you, so they should never be telling you how things made you feel
This is a tactic people have used against gay people for ages. It's the classical ""something must have gone wrong in your childhood and that's why you THINK you aren't straight"".
It's nothing less than a discriminating heteronormative (society expecting everyone to be cis and heterosexual) narrative.
Psychologists should never invalidate your feelings. Have her point you to the research that says being transgender is caused by childhood experiences. As far as I'm aware, no such research exists.
The therapist shouldn't be saying things like that; it sounds like she doesn't understand the trans perspective. I recently had this problem too when looking for a therapist and I realized that even if you aren't going to therapy for trans related issues, it can be a problem that your therapist doesn't ""get it"" for this very reason. If her comment left you saying, ""What? Huh? I feel that way? Really?"" Then it's probably not right. She may be a professional, but without that perspective, she is looking through a biased lens at your problems and offering solutions to what she perceives as a cis woman with trauma. 

At the end of the day, you know yourself the best; you're valid regardless of any opinion, professional or no. Hope you feel better soon, and I hope that this was just a professional blunder on your therapists part.
Regardless of anything, therapists aren't supposed to do that. That exact theory is so full of bullshit that I can't begin anywhere on her thing.
I'm a pre everything trans man and I have almost no disforia (I can't spell and auto correct sucks) but oh boy do I get uforic when people see me as a man. I was smiling all day after some called me brother and I'm depressed as fuck and rarely feel anything other than meh so that day solidified me being trans. Btw what your therapist said sounds like something a shitty tv therapist who was written by someone who hasn't gone to therapy. Please look for a therapist that fits you better.
The absence of dysphoria doesn’t mean you’re not trans.  Focus on the euphoria you get from gender affirmation.  Even if your feelings about your gender were shaped by this event in your early childhood (I’m not saying they were), it doesn’t invalidate the feelings.  There are many ways to look at gender identity. Some say the soul has gender and that it can differ from your physical sex, while others say that the body is simply a canvas for us to make of it what we wish.  I prefer the latter, being agnostic and preferring not to put a definition on the soul.
Your therapist is not a good therapist. You're a man because you were born a man and will stay a man. It's not like you were female and then you became a boy because of your brothers, you're a man and you are valid and you deserve a better therapist. *hugs*
Hello me from whenever I grow enough balls to ask my mom for a therapist (not because of trans things as well). I'm not in your situation yet but remember that not every trans person has body dysphoria also I don't know about you but I did some really egg like things before I found out about that I'm probably trans, to give examples of my own life: I wore dresses to school twice before finding out I'm trans (I'm transfem), in 7th grade I held a presentation about gender swapping in video games, I mostly played female characters in video games. Those examples might not apply to you but maybe you can think of something that you did in the past
that's some of the worst psychology I've ever seen
Please don't speak to that person anymore thats incredibly unprofessional. No life experience can ""cause"" you to be transgender or experience gender dysphoria. You are just trans. Thats all. That person is not only reaching for the stars but is incredibly misinformed and hurting others in the process
Your therapist is not well educated.
Trans is any discontinuity between gender assignment at birth (usually presumed by obvious sex characteristics), and how you feel inside (identity).

It is not required to be a consistent disparity through time.  It is not required to be validated nor negated by confounding or causal factors.

As to the therapist, they are supposed to guide you through your own thought discovery, and not define things for you.  A supposition, “maybe” or “could it be” is the more proper wording from them.

If they are seeking agreement from you, that would be another problem.  If disagreement is a threat to them, that would also be a problem.  You should feel empowered to advocate for yourself, but not required to do so.

In the end, a therapist is someone you can talk about your inner struggles, secrets, etc., who will help you excavate the things you may not realize, or hide from.  If this gets you thinking, then maybe it’s effective.  Questioning yourself is an important part of self discovery.

But, they should have worded this differently.  You should be able to go back and say you are not sure you agree, or even if you do agree, that you can define which parts you actually struggle with vs do not.

Just my thoughts, and not any sort of professional opinion, etc.
Your therapist is probably full of shit, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're necessarily going to benefit from transitioning either. Take a little while to reflect and talk to a different therapist, preferably who specializes in gender therapy
You don't have to have dysphoria to be trans!  I'm sure other comments mentioned that as well but it's so important to remember.  You are valid and you know yourself way better than that therapist.
Oh no freudian psychology
I can’t tell you if you’re trans or not cuz I don’t know a whole lot about you, but it based on the fact that you had no doubts before and you genuinely feel uncomfortable being misgender, it seems like you most likely are trans since the only thing that made you doubt yourself is what your therapist said.

A lot of trans people do struggle with thoughts that they’re “faking” and “just doing it for attention” so you’re definitely not alone! I’d suggest maybe talking to people who have similar thoughts and see what they may do to reassure themselves that they’re trans! 

Lastly, I wanna add that no matter if that’s the reason or not, the fact that you do feel like a boy right now is what’s important. If you do come to the conclusion that you aren’t trans, that’s fine! But for now you do feel like a boy, and as I said, that’s all that really matters!
Do you see yourself being a women in ten years? Do you want everyone to call you she? If the answer is no to those questions then you’re probably trans but just to solidify it.
 Do you want to be your brother or be his brother?
Your therapist is a human piece of shit garbage asshole. You do not need dysphoria to be trans and anyone who thinks that is scientiffically wrong. And also a transphobe. If you think you are trans. You are trans. That's not something anyone but you can decide. Even if they are a therapist. Therapy that makes you more insecure is not therapy. That's bullshit. Sorry for the anger but I genuinenly hate people like that. It just makes you feel like shit. And that's no good.
Ok I can’t tell a lot about trans stuff because I’m still figuring it out myself but one thing I can say is your feelings are NEVER invalid and if you ever need someone to talk to and don’t have anyone close to you to do so (and this goes for anyone) reach out to me
Ignore the therapist. Find a new one.

Only 1 thing determines if you are trans: Do you want to be a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth?

If yes, you are trans. Doesn't matter what else is going on socially or in family dynamics. If you answer yes, you're trans.
If you have no dysphoria of course you’re ‘coping’ with something. You even said it yourself, you thrived off the verbal attention. There isn’t anything wrong with experimenting with your identity or seeking validation.

>I swear, before this I was just a happy trans man

If you were happy, then be happy. If you are trans or not boils down to what you are happy doing. Your therapists sounds kinda transphobic tbh bc she straight up said that you’re not trans. Being trans isn’t something you can tell by looking at someone or even licensing to someone’s whole life story, it’s something only you can figure out if you are or not, if you were happy be happy.
Your psychologist is full of shit, plain and simple. It honestly almost sounds like a retread of old Freudian bullshit - fucking penis envy, for gods' sakes.

You don't want to be a boy because you're jealous of *anyone*. You want to be a boy because you ARE a boy. Dysphoria is complicated and can be hard to unravel when you've been dealing with it for so long it's become background noise that you've learned to automatically filter out. Plus gender is a complicated fuck period. Lack of body dysphoria(or inability to identify such) isn't particularly meaningful.

^((Also ""sad from being misgendered"" is a type of dysphoria, even if it's not body dysphoria.))

That ""thrived on the verbal validation of others"" thing though? That's called gender *euphoria*, the opposite of dysphoria, and it's a pretty good indicator that you are in fact trans.
what kind of freudian bullshit is that psychiatrist on?? drop that bitch as soon as you can. what shes doing is borderline conversion therapy and if you let that go on for a longer period of time you will most certainly get some scars.

and to answer your primary question, if you were happy as a transman and felt good about being reffered as a man then you are a man. not everyone feels dysphoria the same, i myself hardly feel it sometimes but someone else might feel it in a much stronger fashion. what you're experiancing is a light version of imposter thoughts, you know the ""oh i just like x because x im not trans lol"" most trans people have had them a few times in their lifetime. i've had them like twice but thats about it

edit: side note as well, a one year old does not get the thought

""oh my brother gets more love and attention than me, i should be a boy so i can get more love and attention as well""

that just does not happen. and while im not incredibly well versed in childrens psychology i am well versed in adult psychology. (been having classes for 3 years and still going) and something i do about childrens psyche is that thoughts like that are not only rare but also borderline impossible, a child would think

""why is my brother getting more love than me? did i do something wrong?""

then from that you'd be feeling guilt instead of gender insecurity like tf is that psychiatrist on?? im legit fumin babe oh my god

edit2: and now that im thinking about it even more like what the fuck??.

im guessing you're over the age of 15? making you an adult in terms of psychology, so why the fuck is you ADULT PSYCHIATRIST making statements about a CHILDS psyche. oh. my. god. this is so fucked what the hell??? im so sorry you had to go through this absolute dogshit behaviour from a psychiatrist.
That's not a therapist. I don't know what the fuck is up with therapists on the topic of genders, but what they said it's bullshit. If you feel like a trans man, you are a trans man. No changing that
Nothing wrong with being a boy with boobs, and also if that were the reason you would have wanted to be a boy at the time. Like, my kid wants to be a baby because their sibling just got born. Perfectly reasonable. If they come to me in nine years and tell me they want to be a baby, I’m pretty sure the cause would be something else. 

But also, even if that were truly a reason, so what? Wouldn’t make you any less a boy now.
I'll easily put a bet that your therapist is some kind of religious nut too. That is a ""conversion therapy"" response. If it was a sister it would have been - ""You want to be a boy because you were jealous of your sister and therefore resent women as a whole"". If you parents were divorced and you lived with your Dad it would have been because you have had a male upbringing. If you lived with your mum it would have been because you didn't have a male figure and looked to fill that role. It's ridiculous and stupid. Your therapist/psychologist is shit at their job. Tell them to get stuffed and find a better one.
I have found these links quite useful in the past, I hope you do as well.

That therapist is a piece of shit. Fire her as your doctor if you are able and find someone competent who doesn’t have hate in their heart.
Therapist here—

This person is not trans informed, is not sex positive, and doesn’t seem like they are trained in sex therapy.

Most people don’t realize that most therapists receive almost no training in sex therapy or LGBTQ+ issues.

You need a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues, and hopefully someone who is a certified sex therapist.

Ask your therapist for a referral to a LGBTQ+ therapist and one who is preferably sex therapist certified. She is out of her depths and needed to refer you because clearly she is not trained.

Or, you can look for one yourself! There are many out there! You can even go directly to the AASECT website (certified sex therapist website), they have a list of providers who are certified. 

Source: I am a therapist and specialize in sex therapy. Literally the first thing they teach us in sex therapy certification is that it is a myth that trauma is related to LGBTQ+ status. Just because trauma and queerness are present doesn’t mean they are the cause of each other.
That’s bad therapy my dude. Therapist arnt supposed to just mike drop things like that even if they are true. So I wouldn’t take what she is saying as super credible.
Not every trans person has dysphoria! You’re valid
Bad therapist, find a person who has experience or specializes in gender identity therapy. It's not about finding the people who will say what you want to hear. Being told what they told you is bullshit. This therapist trying to lead you into thinking that aligns with their views not yours. Therapist should never try to lead a client like this. 

My therapist never told me I was as transgender or what my identity was or why I felt the way I did. What they did was help me unpack and unclog the bullshit layers of societies expectations, fears of retaliation and rejection, and self loathing from internalize homo/transphobia until I was finally able to say with confidence who I was. They never told me I was right or wrong, they never tried to justify why I felt this way only to help me understand what I was feeling.

Get a better therapist, they are human and can't be expected to know everything. Avoid therapist who aren't specialized or focused. There are no Masters of All.
That sounds like you need a new therapist. Look for specifically trans-friendly therapists.
1. As a healthcare professional, I’m going to use the magic words…”second opinion!”

2. Unless you’ve been living in some PollyAnna world that is only inhabited by nyan cats spreading rainbows across the sky… you know what kind of attention we are most likely to get…. does the psychologist think something happened to you that was so bad that you would want the often negative attention of strangers?

3. Don’t know your grandmother. But in my family one of my afab and cis cousins was primarily raised by our grandmother. You know what? She is the one enjoying her life. Literally the happiest of all of us. She likely got more attention from grandma than we did from out parents.

4. Like physicians, and nurses, mental health professionals have specialties. This one sounds like she stuck back in DSM-3 where being trans was considered mental illness. If she claims to be a gender expert, she’s not a very good one. I would seek out a mental health professional who actually specializes in gender issues. I have one who specializes in substance abuse, gender and trauma. I don’t need the first but the second and third are fantastic for me. She helped me to make up my own mind, and then gave me her opinion, which was to validate what I decided.
Sounds like you need a new therapist ASAP. Try to find one who is allied with the trans community!
I would already be looking for another therapist, that was dismissive and unprofessional on their part.
Wow, that’s quite the leap your therapist is making. If they seriously thought you experienced some kind of unprocessed trauma and wanted to help you work through that then there are constructive ways of doing that without adding another crisis on top of whatever else you’re dealing with. 

This aside, 1) I don’t think that there’s medical consensus on the idea that being trans is necessarily a trauma response. 2) Say it is some kind of coping mechanism, does that fundamentally change things? People are trans for all kinds of reasons, some social, some physical, some political, etc. Why would the root of **your** transness invalidated that identity? Why should it make you “not really trans” when you experience similar joys and pains to countless other trans people?  3) What is her goal in trying to identify why you are trans, and why is she telling you her theory? The only thing I can think of is that she’s trying to “cure” your transness, and that’s incredibly dangerous. From here I’d imagine she is going to try to logic you out of being trans and use her position of authority and superior knowledge in the field of psychology to convince you that you’re wrong about what you know about yourself. 

This isn’t worth the headache or the heartache. I’d say to just get another therapist.
shit therapist shouldn’t have a license
Well its possible its true i would get a 2nd opinion and also discuss your ""trans confusion"" with  specialized therapist. More importantly don't stress yourself over this people are complex and trauma makes things worse and no one is even near perfect so don't beat yourself up trying to please others
Yeahh, you should get a new therapist
Transphobic therapist
I and nobody, but You can't answer if You are trans or not. Ask Yourself if You feel comfortable with Your gender, or not. No therapist can answer that for You.
I think the therapist You're seeing has some... Weird idea that people become trans, because of trauma, or something. But it's a guess, because statement like that is... Well... Weird at least. But idk think about it. Remember that therapist doesn't know You better than You know Yourself. And they might point You to directions, but ultimately it's You who's got to help Yourself.
That was completely inappropriate of your practitioner to say. Dump them, and find someone new who doesn't assume and jump to erroneous conclusions.
Yeah no your psychologist is full of shit. What they're saying sounds somewhat Freudian and Freud was full of shit too. You don't have to have gender dysphoria to be trans, you only have to have gender euphoria when identifying as a gender other than the one you were assigned at birth. If being a man gives you euphoria, congrats, you're trans!
Don’t search for gender Dysphoria  search for what makes you (gender) euphoric, because we often try to tell ourself nah thats not Dysphoria but it is. By finding stuff that make you euphoric, you get a more positive viewpoint of yourself 😇
never take the advice about who you are from anyone but yourself, you may not be trans one day and that's okay but if you right now think you are, and feel more comfortable being so then you are valid and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
If the thought of you being not trans makes you anxious, you're trans.
Many cis people have a thought, ""what if im trans?"" But if the thought of you maybe not being trans makes you anxious, you're probably trans.
Btw, it seems like you're mainly experiencing social dysphoria, which is valid. I mainly experience one aspect of body dysphoria which is my chest. Although, I've had an odd gender experience since I have PCOS. When I began to get on birth control to average out my hormones, I began experiencing dysphoria. Apologies for talking about my experiences a bit.


Which makes you most comfortable, most euphoric? Being called a guy, a girl, or a they?
My old therapist tried to say the same thing, but tried saying that since I have ptsd from stuff my cousin and a pedo did that I was probably just using being a boy as a way to keep myself feeling safe. My new therapist though has been very clear that that isn’t a cause of feeling like the opposite gender at all.
Usually, if you're worried that much about faking, you're not faking. You know better than anyone else and even if it can be hard knowing, you're the only one able to tell who you are.
Your therapist either is fake or should be immediately relieved of their therapists’ license, and quite possibly jailed.  You know yourself better than your therapist does, and therapists are literally trained to let you figure everything out on your own with a bit of professional assistance here and there, not to figure it out for you.
A therapist should never tell you how you feel.

Drop them and report them
even if that is the reason, who cares?

If you are happier to identify as a boy, then you are a trans man. no matter how it came to be.

Its not like that's how it works anyway, people don't change their identity over attention. you get far more hate and difficulty living as a openly trans person than you would being cisgender. If you understand that then you aren't faking it.

This is a bigoted psychologist (weather subconsciously or as a conscious decision) trying to invalidate your gender identity. Gender identity is complex and strange and nobody quite knows how it happens or ""how it works"" you cant explain it away with jealousy.
Hot take: so fucking what? I'm gay because my mom didn't love me enough, I'm trans because I was raised religious and women were viewed as lesser. We are all products of our environment, and this cishet bullshit concept that being ""made gay"" is invalid while they simultaneously have conversion camps that try to ""make people straight"" the *exact same way* is disingenuous horseshit. Understanding why you are the way you are doesn't *change* the way you are, nor make it any more or less valid.
This is exactly why you only talk to a therapist that’s a gender identity specialist about gender identity issues. If they don’t, they have absolutely zero credentials to say anything.

What you’re therapist SHOULD have said was they aren’t qualified to give you guidance on this particular topic and looked into places that can.
You know yourself better than anybody! You just have to ponder on yourself and keep like minded people near you! Don’t let someone who went to school a couple of years throw your whole being off. Keep grounded! If you feel your HAPPIER as a trans man, that’s all that matters! We only have one life! Do what feels right for you! She obviously picked at some old wounds for you to be doubtful but don’t worry and continue to live as your authentic self! I too have had family issues and it really hurts. I understand in my own way how that feels. I have half sisters. They got all the attention as well. That doesn’t change who I am though. It does however make me a loving mother to my two girls. Keep your head high. Keep doing you dude!
You don’t need body dysphoria to be trans I’d seek a psychiatrist that specializes with gender identity !
The human brain is dumb... it only wants what it can't have because it's greedy.  

If you want to be transgender, then it tells you otherwise because one is always contradicting the other.  

Your feelings and your brain hate each and life is a constant, never-ending war of unsatisfaction.
That that's the first thing she said after hearing about one experience... That's not therapy, that's conversion, and you need to get the hell out of there. I'm really sorry this happened to you, I understand it must be incredibly confusing. Trauma can absolutely cause gender fuckery, but it's not at all the first go-to explanation for feelings like yours and it's definitely not something a therapist should be looking for (""how can I disprove this person is trans?"")
“If people misgender me, I get sad.” That’s dysphoria.
Your psychologist is full of it.
1. your therapist is a bitch 
2. not getting dysphoria doesn’t make you any less trans. i don’t get dysphoric about my genitalia, but that doesn’t make me any less trans
Honestly, who fucking cares if you are “really” trans, or if childhood trauma “made you” trans, both of which are bullshit— but even if they were true, if being a man makes you *truly* happier. That being a man feels better than being a woman ever did, and it is who you want to be, then you are a man.
Is sad so many psichologists are really bad professionals, I had problems with one of them because she called that I'm a trans woman just by hating men in general, so in her theory I hate men and of course can't be one. (I'm married with a cisgender man and very happy with him)
One of my favorite youtubers likes to say: if you think you‘re faking it, there‘s a pretty good chance you‘re not :)
Having dysphoria doesn’t equate to being trans. It‘s also not a cis thing to like being called the opposite gender, just saying…
What if a friend of yours told you a story like that? How would you react? Would you judge them and their feelings? 

PS: I‘m in a similar situation (little to no body dysphoria, pretty pronounced social dysphoria) and you really help me work through this, thank you!
Yea dude that's kinda dumb. I'm not a therapist or phycologist but I have been around plenty of people who want attention they lacked and they usually just fallow what they're told cause they seek approval and even if that therapist was somehow in your head knowing everything going on in there it's not ok to just tell someone oh yeah the way you live is invalid cause blah blah blah. I had it happen with my parents. I don't get why but it feels as if they just don't want you to feel comfortable. And on top of all of that not every trans person experiences the same thing this includes body dysphoria. Some people just get the euphoria side of it and that doesn't make them any less of themselves so for your therapist to be making such bold claims without knowing much on the subject is pretty unprofessional (I know it's sorta hypocritical to say this while not having official knowledge of psychology but I'm just saying that is that if you're making someone mentally battle themselves instead of helping that not happen you're not doing your job right so yea that therapist may be bias against you or she just doesn't understand trans people that well) hope that you have o good rest of your day bro.
If it's okay with you, I would really like to share this with my therapist and get their perspective on it. Bc this is bullshit and you need some validation.

To be perfectly clear, if you feel more comfortable as a male then that's what you are, no one else has any say in the matter.
Nah this is a homophobic trying to talk you out of it
Report this therapist, they are completely invalidating you with their bullshit “assessment”.
That “therapist” is total garbage. You don’t need to have body dysphoria to be trans! I once heard someone describe it as, if you somewhat tolerate vanilla ice cream, but love chocolate ice cream and feel super happy when you eat it, why would you stay with vanilla? No one can tell you you’re trans except for yourself!
Phsycologists r assholes in my experience, always enjoyed my sessions with therapists over ones with psychologists
A cis person wouldn't worry about being trans or not
Being trans isnt about hating what you were born with, it's about building yourself into something you love. Whether you get dysphoria or not doesnt determine your transness- I'm willing to bet you're exactly like me (and many, many other trans people) whose experiences are more shaped by gender euphoria (joy at your gender) rather than dysphoria.

I think many people, both within and outside of the trans community, focus too much on the pain of dysphoria rather than acknowledging the beautiful joy of euphoria and shaping your life and growing in a way you control. 

The way people outright ignore gender euphoria in many places sets a warped perspective towards trans people and how we 'should' experience our lives and connection to gender rather than seeing the true rainbow of diversity that all communities contain, which, sadly, tends to steer our siblings who don't fit into the mold of 'dysphoric trans person' away from the community.

I hope you find a better therapist my dude, and I hope you grow more assured in your own identity* as you march on into the future. (*whatever it may turn out to be and however many times it may change and adjust, cause life and labels really do like to play around, lol)
No cis person has those thoughts 😃
Yeah that's dumb. And, really, the concept of whether you're ""really trans"" or not is kinda silly too - all that matters in the end is that you feel happier as a man, and you're not hurting anyone by that. Why the feelings exist is pretty much irrelevant, if you feel them they're there and they're real and that's that
What the fuckl?!?!?!? 

Im absolutely appalled 

dump them
Oh, hell no. I don’t have dysphoria, only a little before I started T, now I’m fine. I don’t experience severe dysphoria my ex has. Don’t doubt yourself. You know yourself better than anyone in the entire world does, even if you’re still navigating. That psychologist doesn’t know shit. 

My mom did the same thing; she listed things out, and I doubted myself, but I was upset, so I wasn’t thinking straight, and later my mind became clear. I KNOW I’m a male, and my mom is anti-LGBTQ+. She’s religious.
your psychologist needs to have their license revoked.
Get a new therapist ASAP!! Look for one that specializes in trans issues.  They seem to be the most helpful in the subject of gender.  My therapist said that feeling of ""what if I'm not or feeling like I might regret it is normal.  She's helped me understand that that is my anxiety speaking and helped me realize that I've had suppressed memories of me trying to express my true gender
Yeah, that therapist is wrong. Social dysphoria is just as valid as body dysphoria (in addition to the fact you don’t need dysphoria to be trans) I’d say find a different therapist.
Nah you're trans  what a shitty psychologist
OP you need a new therapist that's all I have to say
I would counter with your psychiatrist. If you give up then they are right. They are just summarizing what you said. It’s open for debate if you like, or do you just wanna leave it at that? Don’t allow the medical fearmongering on Reddit lead you astray. Remember this is your business. If you are transgender and looking for a reason why then there is your answer. However, if you are trying to resolve your dysphoria there is your answer. Just bc you have gender dysphoria doesn’t mean you are transgender. So the opposite is true, as well. This is what medicine is good at. Weeding out your internet dives and misconceived notions you’ve gathered from the internet. As someone who has to drop their knowledge at the door I have trained myself to be a patient when I’m a physician, as well. Doctors make the worse patients so when you are diagnosing yourself physicians see that, and go with that. Leading you to get to your own answers. Take each session with a grain a salt bc it won’t be fixed in one session unless you want it to.
You should report this therapist for completely invalidating you with their bullshit “assessment”.
Let's put aside the fact that no one can tell you if you're trans or not, and \*let's say\* that it would be possible to feel that way bc of trauma. Even if we do that ""You want to be a boy because you saw your brother getting all the attention and got jealous."" is the worst, weakest and the most naïve take I could ever imagine.

This is actually one of the qualms I had with Jules' special episode on euphoria, where she's in therapy. At one point the therapist just kinda makes a connection and interrupts Jules instead of just letting her talk. Like childhood experiences are important, but I think even still a lot of Freudian-esque bullshit makes its way into media representations of therapy and even some actual therapy, trying to make some sort of profound connection instead of actually trying to address the issue.
This resonates a lot with me. I've started to think of my journey as the Marie Kondo Trans Experience. You basically start out by accepting ""these things spark joy, I will do them. These other things do not spark joy, and I want them to go away."" Eventually I cleanly fit into a label, but I didn't have that clarity until I started living the parts I knew. My identity keeps getting clearer over time as I'm on HRT and presenting female, and I'm finally starting to have a picture of the future in my head that I'm actually looking forward to.
Thank you so much. This, and all the other comments, really means a lot to me.
Absolutely agree. My 3 year old nephew loves Disney/cartoons and make believe. Sometimes he changes his name to Olaf or Mario and insists everyone call him this, other times he has been Anna, Elsa, Raya and insists on those names. We let him be whatever name is flavor of the day.
That's the catch, though. At the time, I was a little over 1 year old, so I don't remember it at all. 

As for my feelings, I've started feeling 'different' when I was around 12. I think you see my problem now.
Gender euphoria really is like putting on glasses for the first time. Like ""holy shit normal people just... feel comfortable sometimes? In their own bodies?""
>But there is also the possibility that your psychologist is just not educated enough on trans stuff, and that they didn’t realize how harmful that comment could be. Maybe they didn’t know that you’re born trans, and tried to give it an explanation, but still totally support you as trans. In the sense that they were not trying to actually deny your trans identity

Sure, this is the more charitable take. But even if this is what’s going on (which is a pretty big if) the therapist has shown that they are not qualified to help OP. Look at how much her saying this fucked with the poor dude. He went from happy and confident to feeling invalidated because an authority figure told him is entire identity is, essentially, made up. That’s wildly, immorally irresponsible even if it was true, and she’s also very obviously shooting from the hip with pseudoscientific bullcrap.

It’s easy to make trans people doubt themselves - in the world we grew up in, we’re constantly erased, disrespected, questioned, gatekept and belittled.

The bottom line is that this person should not be a therapist, period. They are not qualified. OP, please don’t let this clown plant doubts in your mind. You are valid. ❤️
It's bad therapy because there's no evidence for such a thing. The whole ""looking for attention"" is transphobic propaganda. How many trans people have *actually* just been looking for attention and not really been trans?
If you wanna add it to your autocorrect, the spelling is ""dysphoria."" It's the opposite of euphoria, which should be a word most autocorrects will get right.
Please do not restrict enbies to “in the middle” or “in between” the genders accepted by the binary gender system. Yes, some non-binary peoples identities do fall into that space but there’s so much more than simply being the purple to men and women’s pink and blue. We are all the colours on the colour spectrum apart from pink and blue, from purple to green to yellow to periwinkle to ultraviolet and infrared. 

I would like to know where you think that quack was coming from when you say their words shouldn’t be discredited. How does it work for a one year old to go through something that made them want to change their gender for attention eleven years later? If you’ve been having to put up with a therapist who pulls shit like this on you and you’re just gaslighted, please know that you deserve better than a therapist talking to you like this.
This OP. It sucks to start again but I think you should browse for a new therapist and report this one for invalidating you. Im in college and gender identity is no longer a question of your “beliefs” or “politics” or “religion” . Gender  identity is becoming a part of human biology and development classes, inclusivity studies are mandatory if you want your papers in my country as a clinical psychologist. Sounds like this therapist needs to update their education.
Yeah sometimes they forget that its an individual and the book doesnt always apply 100%
I had one therapist who tried to make conclusions from just a fraction of informations and i knew that i had to change the therapist cuz their opinions and theories just didnt fit me at all and I knew they didnt even hear the full “story” of me (this wasnt gender related but still similar situation)
Exactly how it feels to me too, well said
So she says you were envious without any proof or indication thereof?
Come on, you were 1 year. You probably didn‘t even compute what happened to you, let alone have the logical capacity to conclude „Oh it‘s because of my brother!“.  

Seems a little farfetched imho.
Lol, my euphoria ranges from a shot of happiness whenever I get a haircut or addressed as my gender to a unicorn blasting rainbows out of its ass at mach 10 to fly over the moon, wagging its tail like a puppy.

I swear I'm an adult- but sometimes wearing clothes I like brings out my inner labrador, lol.
The ""looking for attention"" idea is also inherently backwards. Do those people really think ANY of us enjoy the immense and horrible backlash we get for being trans? Is that enjoyable and worth seeking if it's not necessary? If I am looking for attention, I tell jokes or climb on a table and dance. I don't put a bullseye on my back so people can trample me.

The idea also thoroughly erases the existence of stealth trans people. How would we get attention from being trans if we're stealth? It makes no fucking sense.

All we want is to be happy as our authentic selves. Fuck this tyranny.

One year olds surely do not even have a concept of gender, let alone what a brother is or jealousy.
OP said they were a happy trans man until a quack said something stupid, you think that’s questioning? Since you’re defending the stupid that was said by the therapist then explain the mechanics of how what happened to him at a year old made him want to change gender for attention eleven years later. If it “resonates” so well with you that you think that it even needs consideration then please explain why everyone with a sibling doesn’t become trans to their sibling’s assigned gender? 

It’s not about resonating or not resonating. It’s about a therapist saying something incredibly stupid and abusive.

I forgot I had this until now sent this to me from 2021, made me cry a little lol	"I sent this to me from 2021 to 2022. Wish I could give myself a hug from 2 years ago

I legit remember me sending one in 2022, but doesn't arrive until next month"	"Aww, there's something really sweet about this! If you could talk to your past self, do you think you could make them feel better?
This is ridiculously cute of past you. 

Past me would probably ask the same exact questions in the same order: Happy? Pass? Money? Ugh lol. 

I’m playing AC rn too!
Aaww this is so cute.

Reminds me of how, a few days ago, I went to read my post when I started questioning 2 years ago. I wish I could hug past me, and just say something like ""don't worry, you are a woman and it's totally fine (and 2 years from now you have boobs!)"" She (me) was so confused back then
This made me cry also. I hope you are in a better place now OP. Sending lots of support.
This is why I love trans people so much. Y’all are just so pure and genuine. Like sorry to generalize but every trans person I’ve met has been the nicest most down to earth type.
Sorry but what type of animal crossing is that?         Awww that’s so sweet for past you,  and I hope (if you haven’t already) you get enough money for that and everything will go ok!! 🤍
This is awesome
I deleted my original island because there is no option in the game to change one’s name and because I played a lot with my siblings I used my deadname.

I miss my fully decorated goth island :(

I still play the game from time to time though.
Really cute mail :) I have to try that!
I think I'd give her a hug and say everything is going to be okay things take time so go at your own pace. 


I remember my mindset while writing this back then, was the worst year of my life
yeahhhh the 3 main struggles we all seem to be facing lol and ikr, I legit forgot about this letter until now

Ohhhh, do you play regularly? I've hardly played since the pandemic tbh even though I bought the happy home dlc ((YET to even play that part))

legit you should send your future self a message it might cheer yourself up in the future
Same😭😭😭
aw thank you so much 💕 I am now, still have my bad days but overall starting to like life more and more lol
You know, this makes it even cooler to me! It's almost feels like the past you was aware of their mindset, and may have been trying to change it. 

And now they have given you the chance to compare how you felt then versus now. 
Seems like an awfully thoughtful gift from your past self! 😁
I actually didn’t know you could pick delivery dates haha. I want to try it. I’ve only played solo so not sure if I’ve even had the opportunity to send mail 😂 Guess I didn’t even know you could mail yourself

I used to be a regular! Just deleted my original island and started fresh! Kind of daunting. 

We bought a second Switch a year or two ago and I inherited a physical copy of AC and started my own island. I played for 8ish months and had a pretty sweet setup going and my island was great. So great that all I really had left to do was the daily stuff to earn money and… got bored I guess. 

Everything on my island was designed with efficiency in mind: rocks here, trees there, flowers up there, neighborhood here, etc. I had separate fields for breeding rare flower colors and an extensive tree/veggie farm. Only like 7-8 non-fruit trees for wasps and daily item drops. 

Hoping to be a little less rigid this time lol.
You are most welcome and I’m glad you are in a better place. 💖 I can definitely understand having bad days but I’m glad to hear that you are enjoying life more! 😊
yeahhhh I know! I can't wait to see what I said last year 😭😭 gotta keep up with the tradition now lol

Should I risk going on HRT behind my parent's back?	I'm a 29 year old Trans Woman who came out to her parents 4 months ago. My parents aren't exactly pissed off about the fact that I'm Trans, but they've told me very clearly that I cannot transition while living under their roof. They say that they don't want my 10 year old brother to be confused because he sees me as a big brother and not a sister. Anyway, I'm already making plans to move out this coming Summer. I'm shooting for June, July at the latest so that way I have enough time to save up the money I need. I really only have to put up with my crappy living situation for about another 5 months, but every day that I'm not on HRT makes me sad. I've been thinking about sneaking a visit to Planned Parenthood to see about getting hormones through informed consent. I'd be taking a big risk doing this because even though my parents have never indicated that they would kick me out, I feel like it could lead to me getting tossed out the house if my parents find out. And I don't have a plan B, so I'd be screwed if that happened. But I just can't take it anymore. I'm eager to start my transition as soon as possible.	"You are an adult.  You need to live your life.
You’re a grown ass woman, go for it girlie
It doesn’t matter what they think. They don’t control you. You’re in control of your life.
100% get on HRT. They're not gonna notice anything by the time you leave anyway. 

You probably will though :)
“I’m a 29 year old” say no more. You’re an adult. They don’t control you.
It says a lot that they're worried about ""confusing"" your brother, but they're not worried about what could happen to you if they kick you out. Nor are they worried about how he'd react to you, the beloved older sibling, being thrown out of the house for doing something your parents don't like.
Coming up on 3 months and haven't told my parents who I'm living with. Aside for growing my hair they're not even noticing anything yet. You do what YOU need.
I suggest at least get a game plan of starting HRT, but dont begin the hormones until youre close to moving. You need to worry about your safety first; i know not being able to medically transition can suck but you have plenty of time to be free once youre in your own space. For now i recommend just doing things that can make you feel more fem, like clothes and makeup and such, and find a trusted person or a counselor/dr to talk to, and maybe find possible housing help or get some lgbtq friendly roomies!
[deleted]
This is challenging and there’s risk involved, but I think its doable. If I were you, I’d start making appointment (which in some areas can take a long time). If you have a car or somewhere you could keep the meds if you’re that concerned, maybe it’s worth the precautions. 
I hope your family comes together to be able to talk about it and let your bro know he’s got a big sister looking after him💜
There probably won't be any changes in the next five months that you won't be able to hide. You can buy a binder in a size up if you're worried about it. But as long as you can hide the actual meds themselves, you should be able to do this under their noses if that's what you want to go for.
A lot of people have said it but-- you are an adult, you get to make medical choices for yourself. If you are already planning on moving out, then it is likely that by the time you can no longer mask the effects of HRT, you'll have left.
When I was sixteen yo, I decided that I can't live my live without hrt, my parents not allowed me to take in, so I run away with my only female dress and my cellphone, nothing more, I run to a school were some friends were, talked with the orientation woman, that did nothing to help, but let me stay in the school until they close, so I talked with a friend and his mom got me in her house for a year, where I beggined hrt with my endocrinologist and continued with my psicologist and psiquiatric treatment, and in this vacation of family, my mom really changed her mind and became to accept me and today, with 21 yo, I'm married and she bring me to the altar on my halloween ceremony where I worn a Marvelous cosplay of my favorite character. So, be free, the risks are nothing compared with your happiness (since you are an adult, don't reccomend childs following my example)
If they kick you out for taking a medicine that makes your life better/easier… how do you think that will go down with your 10 year old brother? You really think your parents want to lose face with their youngest by estranging their oldest?

This is a manipulation tactic, and a flimsy one at that. Obviously don’t tell them, but if they find out, I doubt they’d have the actual gall to go through with kicking you out. They just want to control you.
ngl i’ve been doing it in secret since november 😳 it takes awhile to see changes so i think you would be fine unless you had to take off your shirt to swim or something but i would just wear a swim shirt if you ever run into that
Move out first, for safety, I would say, but aside from that, at 29, I don’t see how it’s behind your parents’ back. I’m 22 and I don’t see buying heels without my mother knowing as behind her back. It’s my money.
Kids are a lot more understanding than adults. Your little brother will be fine.
I'm just an ally so I don't know I have a place to say anything. If I did I would say to go for it. Don't waste anymore or your life not living you're life in the best way that reflects who you truly are. I believe we all have this one life and deserve to live it living out our truth. My wife is trans and our 3 kids (6,3,2) have all embraced her as who she is without struggle though they knew this person as their dad prior. That's a poor excuse from you parents in my opinion. You are an adult. There is very little chance of them finding out unless they violate your privacy. You also aren't far from the time you plan to move out. I understand the fear of having no where to go, but can you trust yourself to figure it out if the worst happens?
You are 29 years old. You do not need to wait for anything pertaining to your parents in order to receive necessary medication.

Take it from a person who waited half their life and emigrated in order to transition - the sooner you start getting the hormones and other appropriate treatments you need, the sooner you can start living the life you know you deserve.
Considering HRT may only make smaller changes in that amount of time, and it won't change your voice pitch, maybe they wouldn't notice? If you're able to pass it off, what are they gonna say? ""You seem curvier and that's suspicious"". I know being an adult in this situation doesn't mean you can do whatever you want, unfortunately, so I'm sure you can find ways around it.
My daughter has been on HRT since about.... June? So 7 ish months. The only reason my husband knows she was thinking about starting HRT is because she left her paperwork out and he read it. The differences are slow and gradual, so I think you will be fine. 

Leave no paperwork where your parents can see it, keep your meds with you and if anyone asks, tell them it's an anti depressant. It is, in a way, because becoming the real you will mean you are much happier. 

Many of the early effects do look like a lot of the odder anti depressant med side effects as well, so there's that. 

Go to PP. Get the information. Make an informed decision once you have info. And live your best life, sweetie. You got this.
I mean you’re already transitioning no matter what, since physical transitioning isn’t the only type there is. 

They can’t stop that 

Also there are literal 5 year olds that can accept or understand what transitioning means soo 

You could try some creams or over the counter supplements?
Yes.  Fuck them for trying to be manipulative pieces of shit.

Also you may want to check with an attorney to see if they can even legally kick you out.  They may be able to do something like demand rent, but to actually kick you out legally they probably would have to go through a court process.  

I don't know where you live, but where I live a parent trying to evict a non-minor child for seeking medical care would not be well received by the courts.
I would wait until you're a few months closer, so that the changes will be less noticible. If it's dire, ultimately you could wear binders/tighter bras around your parents since you'll develop a chest. Maybe do some masculinizing makeup. I'm not exactly sure because I'm a trans guy so I haven't done much research on the effects of transfem hormones, but look into it and the changes before making your decision to figure out what the timeline is, and have plans to cover it up if you start showing signs that you're on hrt.
Could you work something out with your parents? Hormones take a long time to work, and it sounds like you're going to be moving in a few months. Maybe your parents would be ok with you starting on hormones but continuing to present as a man while you're at home?
I don't know why so many parents are willing to completely ruin their relationship with their kids over something like this. If my kids ever thought for a second that they would not be welcome in my home because they may choose to transition I will know I've failed as a parent.
Do it! The process is SUPER slow so you probably (for better or worse) won't have any visible side effects for at least the first 3 months and after that the effects arnt very noticeable until like a full 6 months+ in. Plus, if you havnt started the process of getting the meds that alone takes awhile as well. As long as you can keep the appointments/ medication itself away from them, you'll be great and you can enjoy being your true self super soon after you move out!
You’re 29, who asked your parents for their opinion?
Hi. 26-year-old in pretty much the same situation as you.

Without a plan b lined up, I'd wait until you're absolutely sure beyond any doubt that your move this summer is gonna work out. I tried moving out of my parents' a year ago. I moved in with a good friend in a bigger city, so I thought for sure it was gonna work. But things changed & moving back with my parents ended up being the best decision for me.

I know waiting sucks. I truly do empathize. But if you want to start that badly, try to come up with a plan b in case you do kicked out. It's what I've ended up doing, & I just begun the process of starting HRT.

Sometimes the best thing for you is making sure you have stable housing & food.
Full send, it's what I did they haven't noticed a god damn thing. At this point I am a year in and have size D tits and they haven't even brought it up I'm sure they just think I'm getting fat.
go for it honey. there's a very little chance they'd find out anyway, just be careful
 I really hate that line of argumentation they’re using. Your little brother won’t be confused for a very long if at all. Kids will usually just accept things you tell them. So if they just tell him “your big brother is actually your big sister“. Everything would be fine on that front. 

I say go for it. Transition behind their backs. Your parents aren’t respecting you, and they shouldn’t have a say over this part of your life.
Maybe find a plan B first, then start. Find a friend to live with while you work to move out. Different family member? Somewhere cheap to rent with a room mate?
i would say wait until you move out and then explain to your little brother when you get the chance to move out, i understand that it makes you upset not to do it just yet but its better to be safe then sorry.
Your parents don't boss you. I say fuck the patriarchy, you get your HRT and we run away and start an lgbt & ally outpost and drink monster
You aren't obligated to spend years of your life unhappy for the sake of appeasing someone else who really doesn't have that degree of a stake in your lived experience. You gotta do what's best for you. And to be honest, I think it would be beneficial for your brother to see you being happy and yourself. 

Unfortunately your practical concern of having a place to live makes it not so simple. I'm not sure if you have already done this, but if I were you, I would prioritize looking into alternative housing options, and making an action plan that gets you out of your parents' realm of control. If you can forsee a scenario where you are both 1) able to be true to your identity, and 2) housed, I'm sure it will make the next steps become a lot clearer.
At the end of the day, beloved, it is your life. You deserve to be happy and live it the way you want. You owe your parents nothing. You did not ask to be born; it was their decision to have you, therefore, their responsibility to care for you until you could care for yourself. You owe nobody an explanation.  

Sure, you love your parents, but you do not owe them anything. This idea that we should be grateful for anyone else's choice and responsibility is simply ludicrous to me. A false sense of responsibility and gratitude.  Start HRT because deep down in your being, it is the right thing for You to do. At the end of the day, folks are always going to look out for themselves first. What is that saying? "" Me before you."" It may sound selfish, but how can I help anyone else if I don't have myself together?

The best of luck to you! Loads of love and support!
Live your life for you and you alone. Also.... you're 29, come on now you don't need your parents approval for anything
I just wanted to say THANK YOU to everyone for the show of support. I wish I could give every single one of you a hug!
My opinion is that you do it.
You’re 29! You should have moved out ages ago. Do what you want to do
I'd try your best to be as compassionate with your parents as possible and try to hear out their reasoning, and mirror it back to them so they know you understand, and only then tell them how important transition is to you and that with their support you will be closer to them and your brother. Like it sounds to me like you care a lot about family and like you'd probably either end up being closer with their support or more distant without it. Also, if they deny you what you need than their teaching your brother that family is an obstacle to health and wellness where as if they support you they would be teaching your brother that family can love beyond conditionality, they might be uncomfortable with it but they can get used to it in time and be better off for dealing with adversity maturely, or they can just not and teach a worse lesson. Please though, do not implement such reasoning before hearing them out and mirroring their perspective, it's imperative that they know you understand them so they can work better to meet you in the middle.
Honestly. You can easily hide it for like... 6 ish months depending on your genetics. If your sure your moving out on the summer, they won't even know prior.
It's up to you to weigh your options. If getting kicked out is more of a concern than having to wait for HRT, then hold off. If your dysphoria is so bad that you are willing to risk it, then go for it. Even if you do not start HRT, you could always just start the process of getting forms filled out / blood tests done.
It's not like you're going to get HUGE changes in 5 months, so you could start now and maybe they'll notice you have less acne/softer skin to which you could say ""I'm just trying a new face cream"" or something like that. But if you do this, please hide pretty well your pills and everything! Be safe, if you don't think you can be safe while starting HRT there, then please wait a bit more
It should be easy enough to hide, and you shouldn't have any drastic effects that will give you away by the time you are able to leave. Go for it!
Your an adult it shouldn't matter what your parents think imo I think you should go for it if that's what you want
i wouldn't support creating conflict although I do believe they would not kick you, that would make it even more confusing to your lil bro. 

try to have more certainty with your date to move out and start off the hormones based on that, I think that'd be safer and you avoid unnecessary conflicts :)
Just do it, they won't notice.
You’re 29, not 9. You’re an adult if you can move out what leverage do they have? If not then well that’s a different story
I'm personally waiting until my birthday this summer to just get hrt behind my parents back without telling them I'm trans. I'll be 18 by than and I won't have to worry about what they think
They won’t find out. 😉
Go for it. The first couple months a lot of the changes are subtle so if they see you every day they might not notice.
I'd go as far as ""confusing"" your little brother behind their back myself tbh...
That’s what I’m doing. 19 trans female still in college here. Parents transphobic af and everything. I haven’t come out to them yet nor do I feel it’s the right time. But I’m taking HRT behind their backs currently. Your doctor should be able to help you keep it on the down low in terms of bills or anything. I know mine does. But yeah in terms of hiding the pill bottles or anything that’s entirely dependent obv. I mean I do a semi good job myself of hiding it. My puberty blockers, spironolactone, I just keep out in the open and I tell them that it’s acne medication (because I had found out people also take it for acne so figured that would be a good way to take it with them knowing). My estradiol I clearly can’t lie about for any reason they’d believe so I just keep it hidden behind my PC in my room and usually just take it secretly in the mornings.

Personally, I’d say you should. You’re an adult and allowed to be yourself and find happiness. But I also do realize your situation and can empathize if you feel it wouldn’t be possible to hide it well enough. 

If you do though just make sure you talk to your doctor about keeping it under the radar and also make sure you have a plan on how to hide the medication. Personally what I’d recommend is you buy a weekly or monthly pill planner and then just put your medication in there and hide the bottles somewhere you know they would never find it. That way if they just see your pills in your pill planner they won’t know what medication it is.
5 months is a short enough time frame that you can probably hide any changes easily enough,  and change blindness will take care of the rest.
You said enough. Your 29 years old. You can make your own damn decisions without them. You do as you wish and not as your parents say. I hate that they're making excuses for your sibling. That's some shitty transphobia. Do not let your parents dictate who you are and your body. Your brother need to learn to respect that to. Just do it.
Yes
Have you talked to your brother about it? If he's able to understand what you're going through, that eliminates their only reason for you to not do it. Who knows? Maybe he'd be excited to have a big sister instead? Kids can be a lot more understanding and accepting of things than adults give them credit.
I’m 19, almost 20 (ftm) and living with my dad. He wasn’t super against it, but we never really talked about my transitioning since I had came out about 4 years ago. Last year, today actually, I started Testosterone injections. He hadn’t found out until five months in (July of last year) and wasn’t happy. I’ve been one year on T and I couldn’t be happier. Starting hrt was and continues to be one of the best decisions of my life thus far.
Reading the title of this post I assumed you were underage, in which case I would have said probably don’t because you might have to source is illegally on the black market. Given you’re 29 you should really be making your own decisions. Do you have a source of income or any friends who you could stay with in the event of being kicked out? Or is there a shelter in your area for LGBT people (if it’s not trans friendly you may be grouped in with men instead of women)
Yes! That’s what I did and I don’t regret a bit of it. I only wish I did it sooner, despite the risks.
i would say go for it but i don’t personally know your parents so please do consider your safety!
to be honest i think younger people actually start to accept trans people more as they've seen maybe zero transphobia in their life since most people under 12-13 dont know what transgender is. i would take the HRT only a few months before you leave so that they dont notice it but you still get to take it early. if you have a guitar case or any old shoes you dont wear you can hide the pills inside them.
Considering I'm doing the exact same thing  I don't see anything wrong with it. I think I can hide most of the changes so should be relatively easy
ye
Might be worth looking to start 3-4 months before you move out. Very few women have enough physical changes at that point that your parents would be likely to notice them. 

This lets you start before you move out, but keeps a roof over your head for the entire time. It’s a compromise, but I think it’s likely your best path forward. 

The “It’s your life, you gotta do what you gotta do” crowd aren’t the ones who might be made homeless. Unfortunately, the reality is “it’s your life, so make sure your basic needs are met.”

I hope this autumn you’re happy and fully settled in to your new place, and are telling us about all the changes that are happening!
Since many changes of HRT are a process and take some time, probably none would even realise, that you're on HRT. So even if they find the medicine, you could still say, that your brother wouldn't notice that and you also plan on moving out soon and that they should chill. Like their arguments with your brother don't work for HRT
You're 29, I'd get it if you were 17, but it's your decision
You are an adult you can legally now disobey your parents if you want… tho i would have a place or a friends house lined up as it sounds likely they will kick you out the second they find out.. and hrt is something they will notice eventually
Honestly as someone who has been homeless I say don’t, once you move out go for it, and if you feel you must make sure you have a plan in case they find out, check what resources are in the area to aid you, etc.
Look, they don’t get a say in your bodily autonomy unless you give them a say. I’d say go for it, just be sure to hide it well for your own safety and well-being.

But if you’re not feeling safe, holding off until you get out of that situation isn’t the end of the world.

None of us can answer this question for you, only you can know if its worth the risk. Be happy, in secret, or be sad with a place to live until you can get your own place. 

Good luck.
Imo you should go for it. Idk how it is where you live, but chances are you wont get hrt right away bc they need to see which medication fits your body the best n stuff (at least in germany). So you have time anyway. Maybe if you talk with a friend about this they would let you stay at their home if the worst case happens.
Either way you can go inform yourself and work on a plan b and decide along the way. I mean they cant blame you for ""preparing"" whats to come in 5 month (at least to their knowlege) and steps in the right direction should help you with how u feel I think
I think the fact that HRT doesn’t work too fast and will not create many physical changes in just 5 months means you absolutely should do it. I don’t think cis people really would notice many of the changes imho. As long as you have a good hiding spot for your pills I think you are probably quite safe. Good luck no matter what you do girl! 🏳️‍⚧️❤️🏳️‍⚧️
You can at least GET your hrt. Having T sitting around in my home is what reminds my dysphoric and suicidal ass that there'll be a next dose. Can you hide it well? Can you pass off smooth skin as a skincare regiment? Are you willing to go put up an act for your parents despite doing things contrary to their wishes? If yes to all, go for it. And a little suggestion. By time you started having a plan B and C for everything in life. I say this with the most empathy possible.
You are >only< obligated to yourself and nobody else. They don't control who you get to be
one thing to consider is most trans homeless aid cuts off at age 25. so if your housing is at risk, i'd be important to have a safe place you can live if things go bad. As someone who escaped a toxic household, it sounds like at least not living with them will do you a lot of good; of course, without a plan b, that's hella hard.   


also depends how invasive they are. if they're going through your stuff or feel entitled to know what meds you're taking, it's not finna be a safe environment. It's been a while since I transitioned, but it think titty growth is the main thing that could give you away, and that tends to take about a year iirc  


I'd suggest trying to network with other queer folk in the area, and see if you can find a plan b from doing that.
Do your parents go through your stuff and are really nosey ?
You’re almost fuckin 30. It’s not “behind their backs”, not in any way, shape, or form.
Do it it takes a few months for it to really start, good luck, and fucking confused, please, 10 year olds are either smart enough to deal with it or too dumb to care
Move out. Living with your parents at that age is pathetic.
lol kids don’t give a single shit, fuck them
You don't need your parents permission as an adult. Do it. You can hide changes for a little while if you need to
Get on HRT….it shouldn’t become too noticeable right away…5 months isn’t gonna out you.  I also get a small cheap storage unit and keep your hormones in them or better yet a combination safe and keep the hormones in them….
You’ve got to live girl!
I'd say go for it. I'm pretty sure HRT won't have any noticable effects to them in such a short period of time. And being in US, planned parenthood and all, it shouldn't be too hard to pull of.

If they do find out hopefully their threats were just grandstanding, otherwise they'll be the bad role models for your brother. It sure would suck, but you're an adult so you might as well rip that bandaid off when ready.

Whatever you do, best of luck and ❤️ xx
Go on HRT. You need to be who you are and you need to live your life.
You can start whenever. The changes will come in slow enough and you can still ""boy mode"" for a long time if your ^(transphobic) parents are ""worried about the children"" (which is a bullshit excuse btw they don't want you transitioning and it's such that they're using a child as a shield so they don't feel as bad for denying you something that you need)
On the one hand:
 you're 29, you have full autonomy.

On the other hand:


>I feel like it could lead to me getting tossed out the house
I’m pretty much in the same situation and I’m doing it. I mean, in 5 months not many things are going to happen and when you get out of there still may enjoy those 5 months of changes. Be stealthy, be looking for a place to go and in case something goes terribly wrong you’ll still could go a friend’s for a little till you find something. I feel like we are the oppressed defiers of this century, gay people went thru this, we can also
They say you get better results the sooner you start and you shouldnt hold of living your life/ being ture to yourself!   
/Id say go for it :D
Make sure you’re secure in your living arrangements first.  Cause it’d suck to have that on your shoulders as well as dysphoria.  It sucks to wait but pays off
Kids minds are really maliable, him learning now would go infinitely better than in say 8 years because he's more likely to take in the information and not have as many deepest biases to overcome, your parents are being assholes and clearly don't understand how children work
Im honestly gonna say it. 
Do it, you’re moving. Start now so when you get out youll be you. Changes don’t start right away, di it. Live your life. Live the truth.
I would just make sure that in case of them kicking you out you have a place to stay and a source of income. Youre an adult so I definitely agree that you should go on hrt whenever you want, just make sure you wont become homeless since especially as a trans woman, it can be dangerous. Good luck!!
If the plan is to move out this summer anyway that’s only a few months away. If that’s a hard move date 4 to 6 months of hormones may just start having (visible) effects around then. Keep in mind they may want labs and other stuff run before they prescribe, sooner to start the better. I think most doctors start on a lower dose and ramp up, and given your age and likely dropping rate of growth hormone (hgh) you should start as soon as you can, for maximum development. I started at 25 and wish I could have gotten on the right track (for me) sooner. 

Oh and my parents were not on board either, when they say “transition” do you think they mean hormones or name, clothing and going out as your true self. For my situation the hormones were one thing but at first what they really had an issue with was me being out and around them, gets better with time though.
Best of luck! I’m rooting for ya!
If your planning on moving out go for it. You’ll have probably half a year at least before you see noticeable breast growth, so it well be easy to hide. Most people can go a long while boy moding before they consistently male fail. 

Just look at Abigail Thorne, creator of philosophy tube who transitioned for two years before coming out on her channel and nobody suspected a thing.
You are an adult. So it really depends on how you could stand possible further conflicts. It is safest to do HRT after moving out though.
Didn't tell anyone, when i started hrt for more than 7 month,  seems nobody found it ist, only one of my Friends, who hadn't seen me for as long told me: ""something is different with you"" but can't anwer my question about what it is
Yes. Fuck them
I’m currently 19, at school trying to start HRT and my mom doesn’t really wanna believe that I’m trans. It’s a lot for our parents to handle, and honestly, I just don’t want to hear their opinions at this point. I’ll be 20 this year and just want to feel happy and confident in my body for the first time
Sis, just do it. 5 months on HRT won’t be noticeable enough for them (maybe for most people) Plus your bro will see you in the future anyway so he’ll figure out your actually his sister later in life. Your parents really didn’t think this through did they? A year passes and they really don’t think your lil bro won’t notice when you visit your changes or beautiful voice. Are they dumb? Sorry my parents did the same thing. I moved out and started transitioning. Once my voice got deeper and face changed they started acting dumb founded even though they knew I was transitioning. My niece faithfully calls me he/him.
Order it from amazing4health
You are an adult and can do whatever you want. Changes won't be obvious for awhile any way. Do what makes you happy
So if your trying to do that just just have to time it right most noticeable changes start 3-6 months after going on HRT with the maximum effect taking several years. I’ve been on estrogen for 2 months now and have had 4 injections and the only noticeable thing so far for me has been thinner body hair and slower growth. (Everyone’s different and I’m 27 for reference) plus I don’t know what your state laws are reguardinf transitioning but usually it involves atleast two meetings with a psychiatrist (so they can write you a letter of recommendation to your endocrinologist to begin HRT)and a 30 day “make sure you really want to start HRT thing” also I can strongly recommend going on HRT as soon as possible the mental change is Immediate and so worth it if it’s what you need , also do the research about how you want to take HRT (injections , orally , patches ) (I recommend them in that order but do the research and see what would be best for you ) my dms are open if you have anymore questions:)
Your overall safety is important, and sometimes that means your need for shelter precedes your need to transition when you want to. I never advise anyone to risk their basic needs to transition even if I feel transitioning when you want to is so important for trans people. However, the risks I’ve taken for my gender affirmation have been the best risks I’ve ever taken and I’ve never regretted a single one. The only regrets I have are being too scared to act sooner. Lots of love to you!!
Yes. Lie your ass off. Fuck them. Just be careful.
Okay so, as long as they don't see any remnants of the HRT, i think you'll be fine. HRT takes a bit to do much, and like somebody else said, you shouldnt have too hard of a time hiding the effects for five months. However, I think it's also a good idea to try and find a backup plan if things don't pan out. If you can't find any backup plans and/or you think it'll be to risky, wait a month or two. Transition in non-hormonal ways (if you haven't already or if possible), and if you can talk to them about talking to your brother about you, that's a really good idea. 10 year olds are stupidly smart. If none of that seems like a safe option, waiting until you can get out is unfortunately the option that I think would be the best.
Fucking do it, it's not your problem if they don't want to explain the things to your brother, education come from parents, they are just closed parents, you have everything to do it, so do it.
Good luck with your life💋💋
I guarantee you that your 10 year old brother will struggle with this far less than they do.
Kids are a convenient excuse for anti-trans rhetoric. My partner's 5yo brother wasn't confused at all by me saying I was a guy. My younger sister adjusted seamlessly to my pronouns (she's an adult but she also said me being a guy just made sense).
Yea honestly you don't need there consent I will say and please don't take this the wrong way I am a trans women and so I get but there is something to be said about is it something you actually want and I'm not trying to attack you or anything like that just make sure this is what you want and the potential consequences that may follow suit I'm not saying any of this to discourage you please don't take this as such eventually your family will find out and it could result in rocky or even lost relationships
I did it. I was really afraid of my parents, they are strict and controlling. It was really difficult, to think they could understand or support me. So.. I started HRT secretly. Now I am on sixth month of HRT, we don't speak much with my mother, but I don't regret. I was never so happy before.
People tend to deny seeing change they don't want to see, you're most likely going to be perfectly stealth with it for those 5 months unless they find your meds. Have a good hinding place for those and you'll be great, and figure out before hand how you need to get rid of empty packaging so you can figure out if cutting up the prescription bit and throwing it into a public restroom trash is okay or if you can deposit them back at the pharmacy, do you need to burn it, etc.
You’re a grown woman, and also it’s honestly probably better for your little brother to learn about this stuff sooner rather than later imo. Parents who shelter their kids from learning about gender identity are just setting them up to feel insecure later when they think they have to conform to gender roles. If you’re his big sister then he should know that.
Others have said it, but I'll throw in with them - do it. The changes you'll see in the first few months will likely be minimal, on the outside. The hormones will start their magic on the inside, especially mentally, even if it's just knowing that you're making progress.
Odds are that they won’t notice any changes in 3 months. When summer comes, you may be at the point where you need to avoid taking your shirt off around them. 

I have a lot of children in my family. The kids understand being trans quite easily and they have no problems with it. It’s the adults who have the problem. Your parents are projecting on to your brother.
I’m actually in the same boat same age lol I started HRT 4 months ago using the patches and no one knows I’m on it. It takes considerable time to notice results. So if your planning on trying to find your own place like me I would say start it now. You could be on it for almost a year without noticeable changes imo
do what you can to stay safe. try to create a plan b, even if its just small. you’re an adult and can absolutely make your own decisions but if your safety is at risk be careful
You can probably make it through 5 months and get away with it, but honestly you will need a plan B .   Estrogen does what it does....  You can start with a smaller dosage and raise it after a couple months and again you will most likely be OK. It won't necessarily be the physical changes that will happen quickly, but the emotional ones can start very quickly.
Go for it.  Good luck.  They won’t notice the changes right away so it give you time while you move out.
You are grown, and moving out soon. Plus HRT takes a while to get your hands on sometimes so you should probably start now. Your 10 year old brother will come to understand - kids are resilient and open-minded. Your parents won’t be able to control you once you move out, and they have no choice in the matter anyway. You are your own woman and you need to live your own life.
Your life. Do what you want,girl, fuk your parents(mine said the same thing too, so I feel you)
I say just start HRT. There won't be visible enough effects for them to notice in the few months it takes you to move out.
So 5 months of hrt can be a lifesaver tbh.  Im a bit over 6 and I'm already feeling so much better about myself.  That said, if you can wait, it might be safest.  It may be possible to hide some of the changes, but it might also not.  Breast growth varies based on person, but some women grow rather quickly and unless you're wearing baggy stuff, it can be difficult to hide them.  I'd also be sure you have a place to hide your hrt.
Wait like a month until you can move out, then start. That way if they do throw you out, you wouldn't have to wait long
Do what makes you happy and if they throw a fit they can fuck off, it's their house but it's your life, not theirs. Also it's literally just transphobia, your brother won't be confused about anything
This may be unpopular opinion but it is an objective truth I’m trying to express You have gone this long you should respect your parents opinion on what they want and don’t want there child exposed to I don’t think your wrong for wanting to but I do think you would be wrong to do it without there consent considering your brother he is young and there is enough confusion and stigma around this situation your 29 your moving out in 5 months just wait
I think you should tell them you intend to, and see how they feel like if they'll kick you out and if yes just do it behind their backs and move out asap
I’m at 7.5 months and my parents still have no clue

go for it, they won’t notice
Just be careful that they don’t see any hrt meds and you’re gucci. I doubt they’ll kick you out if you just keep going about your life as normal as possible
HRT TAKES SO FUCKING LONG TO WORK JUST START YOU WONT NOTICE MUCH DIFFERENCE UNTIL YOU MOVE OUT GO FOR IT GURL!!!
If you’re past 18 you have every right to transition and your parents should have no say in that
I would go for it.
10 year olds are a lot more mature than ppl give them credit for. Also it be good for him to have some exposure and to see lgbtq ppl are like any other. Not only would you be happy but you could help this kid learn. I also think your brothers support would make your parents soften up somewhat

Ofc if you feel like coming out would be unsafe then definitely don’t. You have plenty of time to transition and you’ll reach your goals. I believe in you <3
If you're moving, then I say do it, just make sure that you don't get caught. Come up with a plan to do it safely and secretly. At the very least, you could start looking into it and figuring it out with a therapist.
I mean you’re 29 if it’s what YOU want do that. You’re not 15, you’re old enough to do it yourself, you don’t need their approval even if you want it
I would just recommend you be careful. Be safe. If there's a friend who would be willing to take you in until June or July if your parents kick you out, that might be an option.
Man fuck them I hate this stupid crap because I was forced to watch my crusty ass siblings and I didn’t get paid anything for it but they’re telling me how to spend my money my mom thinks she’s visiting me and thinks I’m visiting her absolutely not(I recently moved and my mom tried to she/her confuse my roommate so he’d call me she/her but he’s cool so he tries hard)
transition is a slow process and getting the jump on it by 5 months wont make a huge difference in the long run, and you probably wouldnt notice any big changes over the five months since the first six or so is usually just getting the dosage to the right spot.  If you can stand boy mode-ing for a little longer id recommend it just to make sure you're secure and have a roof over your head.  That or find a friend who will let you stay with them for a bit if something bad does happen.  I was moved out when I started hrt but made sure to get Medicaid in case my Parents kicked me off the insurance.  Surprisingly they were really cool about it despite having said some transphobic things in the past and them being fairly religious \[esp my mom\].  nevertheless, im glad I had that plan B set up.  so if you do decide to start now, I think it will probably be fine, but I do recommend setting up a good plan b and maybe even c
Not the easiest situation, but given wait times and the time it takes for hormones to kick in, as long as you're careful you could definitely make it to june/July without them noticing anything. On another note, what do you think your brother would say if you told him? I found my younger sibling way more understanding than my parents, it's far more commonplace nowadays. If you feel comfortable, maybe try coming out to your brother. Hopefully it goes well, in which case you have an ally on your side and have gotten rid of the prime argument your parents have against you transitioning
I’m transitioning without anyone in my household knowing
So heartless for them to blame anything that happens to your brother on you. Your brother is confused it's because he witnesses hate from people he loves.
Their roof, their rules. Like most people said, you're an adult and they can't control your life. The issue is as long as you're under their roof, their rules apply to you. I'm a dumb child so take this with a grain of salt, but I think you shouldn't start anything unless or until you have a backup plan to support yourself in a worst case scenario. Just play it smart and be patient as I'd hate for something bad to happen, good luck <3
I think you should do it. You're 29, and you've been living their truth the entire time. It's high time you start living your truth. I support.
If/when you come out to your brother, he’ll get it right away. It’s really about your parents and not him. Idk, personally I’d just do it and figure something out in the time it takes for it to be noticeable.
Had a similar experience, they just started noticing changes and by then 4 months had past by and they couldn't do anything to stop me. Sometimes its better to ask for forgiveness.
even if you start HRT now, it’s not going to happen over night, it’s a very slow process
Do it!!! We love you 🙏🏼
Girl, you are an adult, go for it
You're an adult, it's time to move out and live your own life.
I think you should. It’s your choice and they can’t really stop you because you’re literally a legal adult. Anyways, good luck girlie!
Rather than give you advice, which I can’t give because I don’t know your parents, let me tell you my own story of doing a similar thing and what happened. , 

I came out as trans at the eve of my second to last year of college.  It was the end of my 4th, but I was in engineering and I had a few classes I needed to be there for another year to take.  I thought my parents would take it well.  My mom eventually accepted me.  My dad never has.

I had a full ride scholarship for those first four years, but in the fifth year it ran out.  I didn’t need a tom of money to finish relative to the overall cost of school, but I did need more money, and I was asking for it from my dad.  He told he that if I transitioned he wouldn’t help me out.  I chose to hold off transition until I was financially independent.

That year sucked, in more ways than one.  He hadn’t canned me from presenting femme full time so I did, and everyone at the school who I cared about was accepting.  But I spent the year getting more and more depressed.  every time I had to deal with my dad was a nightmare.  The lowest point of the year was when I went home for the holidays.  I was depressed the whole time, often to the point of barely wanting to speak.  At one point I was cleaning an ice pick, he said something awful to me, and it took all of my self discipline not to drive that ice pick through his temple and put him out of my misery.

My relationship never recovered with him.  It was an easy year school wise.  He had also forced me to go full time instead of part time for some irrational reason so I took a lot of fun classes.  I was going to parties filled with accepting queer-folk almost every weekend.  But once I was away from others I was incredibly depressed and frequently drunk.

After that year he tried to keep stopping me.  I got a job but it was a contract position and I was still on their insurance through COBRA.  he threatened to cut off my health insurance if I transitioned, even though I was paying for it myself.  But I was making enough I didn’t need that, so I was able to force the issue.  My life continued it’s downward spiral after I started hrt, but that’s another story.  I eventually disowned my father over his continued attempts to stop me and we don’t speak anymore.

So what should you do?  I don’t know.  It’s a trade off.  It’s your emotional well being versus access to resources.  My mistake was that I grossly underestimated the personal cost to me of trying to suppress myself.  5 months is a long time to be both aware that you need it and not getting it. Doable?  Yes.  Worth it?  Only you can know.

Also, be aware that your parents may be throwing up road blocks and excuses and this might not be the end of it.  They are, it sounds like, hiding behind your brother.  Maybe they just need time to accept, but they are going to have to deal with you transitioning eventually and probably sooner than they feel comfortable.

Taking hormones in secret might make that harder to navigate down the road if you get caught.  what they might need here is an earnest and frank conversation about it where they have space to work out their feelings and where you can clarify your own.  This situation will almost certainly hurt your relationship with them.  If that relationship is important to them, it might help move things forward if they understand what they are asking of you and you understand how to help them work out their own feelings such that you can be you and they can be comfortable.

True, but right now, I'm at their mercy for a roof over my head. That's what I'm hung up on.
Well, they do in this case, somewhat. I’m leaning towards she should do it though, and just not advertise the fact. Particularly if she has plans to leave anyway.
THIS!!
I’m surprised more people haven’t said this. I have absolutely no idea how hard it is currently for OP, but there have to be safer ways to alleviate dysphoria. I wish the best of luck in any case
heat is bad for medicine...
I mean, even if my little brother does find out I'm trans, I doubt it'd be much of a surprise. I already dress somewhat feminine. Skintight women's jeans, panties(though they don't know I wear them) I wear nail polish and carry a purse. Plus I have a big Trans flag pinned to the wall in my room that he has seen, though he has not asked me about it nor do I think he knows what the flag stands for.
It basically comes down to the fact that they don't want me transitioning in their face(even though I'm already sorta doing that). And the fact that until I do move out, I'm at their mercy for a roof over my head.
I think this really is a big concern. Are there places she can go to if shit hits the fan? 
I wouldnt go for it until I felt save, but then again. Other commentors pointed out how long hrt takes and the possibility to mask the changes.
No way of deciding things with how little info we have. Getting a game plan should be the next step, I feel.
Self medicating could lead to some serious side effects. I only want to do HRT under the supervision of a doctor.
My 3 year old niece completely accepts me as her aunt and I was her uncle for 2/3rds of her life.
My goal is to get my own apartment this Summer. I've already got a decent amount of money saved up, but it's still not quite enough to move out yet.
My parents essentially want to keep my little brother inside a bubble. They don't want him worried about Trans or gay or LGBTQ stuff. They just want him to be a kid. If I say anything, it might set them off.
I have a full-time job. As far as friends to rely on, I have none.
Thankfully, my parents aren't the type to go snooping around in my room looking for stuff. I should be able to hide pills pretty easily.
Thankfully, no. I shouldn't have a hard time hiding hormone pills in my closet or something.
Actually you could also start on low HRT so that your levels start to change but the changes aren’t drastic. By the time you move out they can higher your dosage.
A rule I live by: don’t be afraid to take risks, but only if you have fully made peace with the possible consequences.
There won't be any therapists involved. I'm using informed consent to get on HRT.
""No Balls"" is eventually my goal😅
Autocorrect makes morons of us all.

You’re is an abbreviation of “you are” whereas your is used more in a possessive sense.

shit im in the same boat but i said fuck it. im an adult and tbh i say if they kick me out so be it. im sure my sister will gladly take me in because shes offered once before to get out of this toxic household. i say go for it. better now than later
I'd go for it. Even if you started tomorrow, I think you'd be pretty lucky to be unable to hide the changes by July. And if you have wait time, you might only be starting around then anyway
Girl I know that feeling all too well. Being in a Chinese family, that feeling is even stronger but I just went “fuck it” and did it all behind my parents’ back. They were upset with me and I no longer talk to my dad but my self esteem has gone through the roof and I’ve made so many friends. Can confidently say that transitioning has been the best decision I’ve made in my life.
You got friends or a shelter that can take you in temporary?
Hey, have you tried looking for trans shelters where you live? If you intend to start transitioning that's great but having a back up is great too.
Yeah, legally they can kick you out and there’s nothing you can really do about it. Having a roof over your head is the most basic form of psychological well being.
If you're planning on moving out in 5/6 months anyway, they're unlikely to notice anything until after you're already gone, particularly if you stay on a relatively small dose (like 2 to 4 mg estradiol daily). I'd say go for it, just be careful and make sure you his your meds well.

Also, fuck them for using your brother against you. Kids are usually the best at getting it, it's the adults who have trouble dealing with their already-cemented biases.
If you think you can be gone by June/July, they probably won't notice much of a physical change until then. For the vast majority of people being on HRT remains ""hideable"" for a while. Just think about it, if you really want it maybe you should go for it !
Like I said, relocate first.
I feel like that's arguably worse tbh. The only thing I really knew about LGBT+ stuff was what my parents and a few other people said around me. It was never really in a good light though... But it was never like, explained to me at all, just that men could like men, women could like women, but that those people were ""othered"" essentially. 

You could always just ask him what he thinks about it without saying anything directly to him. He's gonna learn about this stuff one way or another, and it would honestly be better if he learns about it sooner rather than later. Otherwise they run the risk of having feelings and such that they don't understand and thinking there's something wrong with them. 

Maybe consider talking to your parents about the possibility that your brother could end up being LGBT+ as well, and that you're concerned that him not knowing anything at all could be harmful to him as he goes into puberty and such.
With a job, do you think you’d be able to afford rent if you moved out of home or?
Make sure your 10 year old brother don't find it because he might think it's candy or show it to your mom
Ik. You got this 👍
Nuh uh really.
It doesn't really make sense does it?
>shit im in the same boat but i said fuck it

I need that attitude. I'm in that exact situation except I have to go a step further because I can't tell them I'm a girl without... consequences... to say the least. You think it's possible? I'm in Canada so finances shouldn't be the largest concern
i dont knoe how you all do it. Im deeply in the closet and my asian (indian) parents have complete control over my life. At this point ive sort of resigned to repressing but its soul crushing. The answer may be obvious but its next to impossible to break free, with my conditioning and lack of resources.
Do you moisturize?
Nope. If I get kicked out, I'm on my own.
Im sure I could do it if I budgeted money correctly. I'm also in the process of saving up about 4k in preparation for moving out.
i mean my suggestion is go stealth. thats what im doing. my work and family is all transphobic but im gonna go through with transition. nobody in my family or work knows im trans other than my mom soo
That’s something at least. I’d try to make sure you have a plan and money in the bank before doing something that could potentially end up with your parents throwing you out"	sideg4	trans	1037	0.99	2022-02-02 02:50:35

I am pretty sure my son wants to be a girl and I don’t know what to do	"Please note: I am using the pronouns he/him for my son for now, for ease. I am very afraid I’m posting this I may be judged for some reason or other. Please try not to do that and just help me make the right decisions and give the right support my little boy. Thank you.

My son is eight. A couple of months ago we found him searching for videos on body swapping, many many searches on Google like ‘I want to be a girl and I don’t know what to do’ and things like that. We asked him about it, and he got pretty hysterical and said he was searching because he thought it was funny. He only said that after us really trying (probably too much) to get him to talk to us.

Yesterday we found him watching a Disney movie about body swapping. No problem, but he tried to hide it and that made us try and talk to him. He got completely hysterical and wouldn’t talk to us, just fits of tears obviously terrified and probably confused I don’t know. Every time he calmed down because we told him how much we loved him, but then got so panicked and hysterical again when we tried to get him to talk to us. We told him again and again we love him for the beautiful human being he is and we don’t care who he decides to be, just that he stays the wonderful and beautiful little human being he is. 

I tried again yesterday after we found in his search history he was searching related topics and wearing make up If you are a boy and said to him “would you like me to tell you what I think is going on” and he said no. So we just can’t talk to him about this. 

I will be honest I just don’t know what to do. If I don’t get him to talk to us I am terrified he will grow up sad that we didn’t try and make him engage. But if I force him to engage right now I think he might just tell us anything to get us off his back and it will cause more problems for him. 

He is so beautiful. And whether he wants to be a boy or a girl or non binary whatever All I care is that he stays the beautiful human being he is. Kind and wonderful and loving, just an incredible human.

I just don’t know how best to help. My wife is a psychologist but not in this field and she suggested we get him to talk to a psychologist but I’m not sure because I don’t want him to think he is doing anything wrong.


I think he wants to be a girl, but my wife thinks we shouldn’t make any guesses about an eight year old. I just want him to be his authentic self, always, and I will love him all the same, no matter what. I am desperate to give him the best life and not one where he has to feel he must hide who he is.

What do I do? Do I get him to speak to someone? Or does he not really know and I just keep reminding him how we love him so much. He is my best buddy and nothing will change how I feel about him I just want to protect him and care for him until I leave this earth. 

Thank you for your advice."	"[deleted]
Does your kid like reading? If so I highly recommend Melissa by Alex Gino (previously published with the title george) It’s a middle grade book about a young trans girl who wants to play charlotte in her school play of charlotte’s web, but she isn’t out yet so people don’t really get why she wants a girls part.
It seems to me you're off to a better start than you might realize. Even if it's turbulent, the number on thing a child needs in life is for their guardians to be wholly excepting and loving of them.

You have that down. There's people who can give you better advice on where to go from here, but I'm just trying to let you know you're doing a great job, even if it doesn't feel like it.

This random Redditor recognizes your effort, and appreciates it. You're human too, and you need affirmation as much as your child.

Therapy is a great idea, I think. Getting your son to a professional who deals with this stuff might make his little noggin handle it a bit better.

Beyond that, if you haven't already, I think it would benefit if you could boil it down in simple terms that you love him any way he chooses to express himself, and you only want to be involved with it so you can support him.
To me, it seems like somebody, somewhere has taught your child that these feelings are wrong. The same thing happened for me and pushed me to repress the feelings for 15 years. The trigger for your child to ""learn"" this could have been so small that whoever caused the trigger would never remember even causing it.

Given that your child is young and hopefully a few years away from puberty, you have time to slowly approach the subject. If you can do the research on puberty blockers now, you'll be able to get to a position where you know exactly what to do when/if they become necessary.

It's also possible that your child is just generally socially anxious. That certainly wouldn't be unexpected if they are already repressing feelings that would distance them from the male friends they might be being pushed towards by the social structures at school.

Face to face talking might not be the best way to break the ice if that is the case. I don't know how much technology you allow your child access to, but they may be more comfortable opening up in texts, emails, skype, discord, whatever. That way, you also get a lot of time to plan the wording of the initial message.

Points I would recommend covering:

* They have your support no matter how they identify
* You want to be able to let them help explore their identity
* There is nothing wrong with identifying differently to how they are expected by society
* If they'd rather not talk to their parents on the subject, you can arrange for another person to talk to them with.

Hope it all goes well.
S/he is the same person that you gave birth to.  Never lose sight of that.  Part of their beauty is their gender identity. 

I'd recommend getting ahold of your insurance company and asking for a list of transgender friendly therapists in your area and getting him setup with one.  They'll be able to work with him/her and let you know if s/he is trans.

From my own experience and from the information I've got from other trans women, 8 is about the age where many of us first have feelings of being trans.

If you need anything, feel free to PM me.
I can’t imagine how stressful this must be for you. Everything is going to be okay, you’re on a good track. It sounds like your child isn’t ready to come out to you yet, which isn’t your fault! Everyone gets there in their own time, independently of the support around them.

I think, aside from the therapy idea (which is honestly fantastic whether or not they’re trans) it might be helpful to casually have discussions with your wife that show trans people in a very positive light. That can be about famous people, like Elliot Page or Laverne Cox. Make sure the discussion stays heavily on the side of “wow I am so happy that Elliot is living his best life, I couldn’t be more proud of him” and “Laverne is such a graceful woman, I’m pleased she’s getting the recognition she deserves.” This sounds obvious, but steer clear of any misgendering or reference to the gender they were assigned at birth. There’s also no limit to how many times you can tell a child that you love them unconditionally. 

Another comment (which I say with no judgement whatsoever): you mentioned that you told him you don’t care “who he decides to be.” I just want to emphasise that he is not *deciding* anything. While the distinction can seem irrelevant (and he may not even notice), differences in language go a long way in perceived support. Try instead to say “we love you no matter who you grow up to be” or “we would love you exactly the same as our daughter.” It might be a bit soon to bring in the daughter term when talking to him, but it could be helpful to practice gender-neural or feminine-leaning language when you’re talking privately with your wife, just so you have some practice with it.

And finally (apologies, this went on for longer than expected): do your research. Support groups, this subreddit, interviews with trans people, news articles featuring trans people on a local and national level… all of these are your friends. After all, he’s only 8, and you wouldn’t want him to be the educator on any other issue, right?

Above all else, congratulations. It must be incredibly difficult seeing your child in distress and even more difficult to seek the help of strangers. You’re doing really well. Best of luck to you and your beautiful family.
This post really hit me. I was where you are just a few years ago when my son (ftm) started exploring and questioning.  It felt overwhelming and scary as we weren't sure how to proceed. As he was discovering who he is, a therapist for him as well as for us was very helpful. And educating ourselves also gave us the tools to best support him. 
Its not something that needs to be figured out overnight as its a journey of exploration that takes time. 
Some of it was and still is difficult as we can't control how people feel beyond our household but we worked hard at maintaining a loving and supportive home for him.
Will use them pronouns out of respect in this reply. 

I knew I was trans around that age and couldn't really find the braveness to do anything about it until last year. Big part of that was a fear of society and losing my family and friends.

I think if you just show your kid that it's fine by painting trans people in a positive light, like for example, while talking to your wife when you know they are listening talk about an actor or actress that is trans that made a cool project. Talk about different people in a unique  and positive light. Maybe take your kid to a pride parade next year but make it your idea.

Don't tell them this directly otherwise they will know you are targeting them and may be more shameful, find a way to incorporate all this into regular conversation and expose them to curated information fit for an 8 year old, but never confront them directly. If you do this, they will be able to come to you naturally and you will help ease the shame they may be feeling, by making it socially acceptable within your family.

It would also be good to investigate if their classmates are making transphobic comments which may be the source of the shame they is feeling and either change schools, or address the problem if that is the case, because even with a supportive family, if kids are being mean to them it our natural instinct is to want to save face and deny it if someone is being an absolute ass about it, especially at a young age.

At the end of the day it needs to be their decision to open up, and I agree with your point of view that taking them to a psychologist may give them the (wrong) impression that there's something wrong with them that you are trying to fix.

Thankfully there's still 3 to 4 years before puberty starts so, if they decide to open up and decide they are absolutely sure they are a girl, you can help them get the right treatment and while there may be a few rough years socially, they would have a much better adulthood than most of us.

Also, if in the end they aren't trans that's okay too, I have a real interest for crime and serial killers, and I watch a lot of documentaries and read books about it, that doesn't mean I want to start hunting people for sport.

Cheers and thank you for being such a good and supportive parent.
"" for the beautiful human being he is and we don’t care who he decides to be,""

""He is so beautiful. And whether he wants to be a boy or a girl or non binary whatever All I care is that he stays the beautiful human being he is.""

It's not a choice. Help your child understand that.

I think this paragraph mostly says it all. He's 8 and he may or may not know what he wants in the future but right now he doesn't and that's okay. You are supporting him and you're open to whatever the possibilities are. Many of us knew at that age that we were different and I'm sure that plenty of other people ""grew out"" of it and we never hear from them now. As long as he knows he has two loving parents that are there for him then he should fare okay. Thanks for being good parents to your kid, sadly there aren't nearly enough of you.
Honestly, when I was their age I used to do the exact same sorts of things, but I didn’t understand that trans people existed and I certainly didn’t know that being a girl was an option, if I could go back and tell my 8 year old self anything I’d let them know that trans people exist and that being a girl is an option. Maybe start there?
Firstly, keep it chill. Don't make too big a deal out of it. I know you want them to tell you but they don't seem ready, and pressure to do so could make it worse.

Second, just tell them about trans people. Don't even try to ask if that's who they are. Just tell them. Even if they aren't trans, any child should grow up knowing about trans people because they will likely meet trans people in the future. Make it clear that there is nothing wrong with being trans and that you think any parent should support their kids if they're trans. Give them resources that tell them about the kind of things they've been researching.
I want to reiterate what one of the other people wrote, this isn’t a choice. If they are trans then they are your daughter now and forever. I tell people that the choice isn’t to transition or not. The choice is to transition or have a breakdown. It is something that can be put off for years potentially but it will happen. In my case I put it off for 60 years. I will leave this quote here because it seems so appropriate for trans people:

""Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it."" pg. 133, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid
The fact that you are worried because you fear that they might grow up sad, shows what a lovely and caring parent you are <3
You're a great parent. Since your child seems to feel overwhelmed talking about this, but is seeking out reading material, I'd suggest providing high-quality books written for trans kids. Leave it in your child's room with a note saying that you love them unconditionally. Maybe also leave a blank notebook to offer to chat about it through notes. Find a therapist who specializes in this stuff. Good job loving your child!
Everyone is saying not to force him to talk about it, and so... here's something about that.

I didn't realize that I am autistic until well into adulthood.  There is a huge cross section between trans/non binary people and neurodiverse people.  As a child, and even now, when I was under stress, I had a horrible time talking.  While I am not saying your child is autistic, you should consider they might be neurodiverse.  It is possible that there's a stress reaction making them *incapable* of talking about it.  It sounds like they hit full meltdown mode at the very mention.  Even if this doesn't stem from neurological issues for your child, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be smart about trying to communicate, though.

So here's something you may not have considered:  Write them a note or letter, and ask them to write you back, about all their feelings on this.  Use whatever written media they like best, paper, text, telegram, whatever it is they use.  They don't have to do it immediately.  They don't have to do it in the same room as you.  It allows them all the time they need to express their confused feelings without the stress of eyes glued to them.  Give them another venue for expressing their feelings, because not all of us can actually **talk** when we're stressed.  It sounds like your kid might be having problems with that.  You might want to monitor that too, tangentially.
- make sure your child knows it's okay to play with gender. there's no requirement to have it all figured out. some people are genderfluid, some are non-binary, some never figure out what exactly their gender is but they are free to explore it nevertheless.

- are you comfortable modeling some gender nonconformity for your child? stuff like painting your nails together, maybe?

- a therapist for your child is a good idea. I think you and your wife should also have a separate therapist or therapists with expertise in childhood LGBT practice.

- do you ever have story time? some other comments have recommended great books but even just introducing your child to gender non-conforming and trans figures in history would be nice.

- do you have any trans friends who would be interested in spending time with your child? a sense of community, that having different genders and gender expression is totally normal and nothing to be ashamed of, could be good exposure.
As long you love him/her and express that everything is going to be fine. Honestly I wish my parents were like you
I'm glad your trying to help your kid and be there for them! 


I'd recommend to just let him know that you love them, no matter what, whether they want to be a girl or boy. They're your child and you love them and be there for them no matter what.

You can ask them if they want to talk to somebody who maybe knows a bit more about this stuff. (Make clear its just to help them understand and they didn't/aren't doing anything wrong. That this is no punishment or anything of that sort.) 

Them back off. They're 8, probably super confused and afraid of what you may think of them. They need to know that you're there for them, and when they're ready they'll come to you.

Look of there are any LGBTQ+ centers or anything like that near you, that you and your wife can talk to for help and resources. Never hurts to have that, even if it turns out your kid doesn't actually want to be a girl. They might have little pamphlets or books for kids about that kinda topic. Or you could look online for something like that!

Wish you all the best, I'm so happy to hear you trying to be there for your little kid.
Most of what I was going to say have already been mentioned, so I'm just going to add that you are an awesome parent and I really wish my parents had the same guts as when I came out, to do what you are doing. 💪
when i was around 12—13ish i googled and did the exact same stuff you’re describing your child as doing, only difference is that i wasn’t caught doing it, but if i was i’m sure i’d react the same way if not just staying quiet, i was terrified that anyone would find out. at 13-14ish i stopped doing these things snd kind of “gave up” on the idea because i thought it wasn’t actually possible. i had heard the word trans and what it was but i didn’t really know what it actually was. i knew it as “boys/girls who where actually girls/boys” and i thought that it wasn’t me because i was “actually a boy who just wanted to be a girl”. i repressed it for years until early this year when i realised what it actually was i was feeling my whole life, i am. now 18.

i say that you shouldn’t tell him that you think he might be trans, telling someone that they are trans often leads to denying it, even if you’re right. in the cases people accept it it can lead to a lot of doubt and imposter syndrome, kinda as if you’re only doing it because someone told you to.

it is far better to figure it out on your own and come to accept it by yourself. because when you figure it out by yourself it won’t be “because someone told me to” but “because it’s how i feel” and there might not be nearly as much doubt.

but i would recommend telling him what it is, accurately and nuanced but simple enough for him to understand, and maybe without telling him that he might fit into it, let him figure it out by himself. also show that you accept him and the trans community as it will give him a safe environment where he won’t feel ashamed or as scared of accepting it if it is the case or telling you if the time comes.

i have a very supportive family but we never ever spoke about these topics so everything i know has come from the outside and i’ve never felt like i could show it, and i was super scared when coming out even though my mom’s very much a feminist and fights for human rights and my dad was ready to disown my grandma if she didn’t accept my sister when she came out, but still we never talked about any queer topics which made for an environment not inviting for such talks.
I just came here to say that you are on the right track, my friend. Don't push your kid, but also don't feel bad that you've been met with hysterics so far. What's happened? He's gotten hysterical and felt out of control outwardly and you have responded in love. That's what he needed you to do. As others have mentioned, make sure he has space to explore on his own. And be ready with those open arms when he asks for them. Good luck!
It's funny, it reminds me of younger me, except I did a much better job hiding it from my parents (luckily, otherwise they would have kicked my ass) but yeah, I agree with the statements about therapy to help them figure themselves out, someone they can feel safe talking to.
I dunno how universal this experience is, but right as I was realizing I must be trans and the enormity of it hit me, I became extremely panicky thinking about anything to do with it and had trouble talking to anyone for days with the one exception of a close friend who was also trans, and who had helped me realize I was. It passed on its own in time, but it was an incredibly emotionally turbulent time and I needed a lot more rest than normal. If you can put together something fun for your kid like a night out at the movies or something that’s about all you can probably do, as far as I know.
I wish my parents sought out support and information when I was questioning, instead of brushing it under the rug and causing my to suppress it for years. You’re an amazing parent ❤️
Thank you for being supportive and caring. 💜🙏
r/cisparenttranskid might help
All the redditors gave awesome advice, something i wish i knew at a young age was knowing how much my parents did for me but i couldnt understand, they worked their souls out, didnt care what would i become or do, the only time they had left was for checking out for me but as a kid i didnt get it, and them asking for school made me absolutely mad thinking i was only seen as the ""only has to study child"" but it was never that way. Until i said hey im this person, who likes this and feels like this, i understood their point. So yeah, show your child ways of support they can understand to make them feel safe and be proud about it because no one learns to put themselves down for who they are out of nowhere, and that loved kid deserves to feel the support they are given. Wishing the best and be safe!
They might not yet know of the concept of being trans, or at least not all of it. I assume they panic because they still interpret it as weird to not be masculine when that is all they've ever known. Try to learn about the subject with them, and teach them as they go. They may or may not find that it's for them. Sometimes it just takes being aware of something to know if it pertains to you. Hope this helps you and your child!
I know its not exactly the best source for anything but i feel its written in a way that an 8 year old could understand. I would recommend reading chapters 33 to 35 of the prettiest platypus. Note the main comic isnt really appropriate for an 8 year old, but in these chapters the main character reads a children’s book that explains trans people in a digestible way. 

[Heres the comic in case you feel like doing this](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/the-prettiest-platypus/list?title_no=463063)
Personally id be very wary of having a child see a mental health professional. Seeing them when I was young caused me a lot of developmental issues. I would, however, monitor their searches and stuff. You don't want them to start research things like self mutilation or self surgery because that's a dark path. Just watch and provide them the love you already give is my 2 cents.
Rather than trying to get him to talk about his feelings why don't you just recognize what he wants to do so if he wants to dress up like a girl why don't you get him some clothes and maybe dress him up and see how he reacts at home or simply buy him some clothes that you think he would like or better yet take him shopping but if he shall I get him some stuff to leave it on his bed and let him try it out and have fun maybe leave him a note on the bed telling him that it's okay that he wants to do this and if he ever wants to to talk or want some help with makeup you would be more than happy to help
Start with toys. For me (MTF) I’d get girl characters of boy toys mixed with other toys that were guys. I wish though that my parents would be like “get whatever toy you want from any aisle” ofc within reasonable price range if necessary. Even clothes. Sure most places separate the genders but even shoes or like t-shirts could work if you don’t want to push it. Just let them have free will in things that aren’t so major. When I got older and wanted to wear makeup my parents were a hard no. Eventually I was able to and used to wear it everyday. The makeup was a phase. I love makeup but now only wear it when going out or for something special.
Do they know what non binary and trans is you could use non binary pronouns for them like they/them/kid/child sorta things and if he doesn’t know what trans and lgbtqia+ is I’d try and show them and tell them about it after researching and tell them that it’s ok to be part of that and if he wants to be a girl he has your full support
I think at this stage the best thing you can do is give him some space and let him come to you if he wants to talk about it. You’ve made it clear that you won’t judge him if he is trans, so hopefully that will make if easier for him if he does turn out to be. 

It may also have freaked him out a bit to realise you had seen his search history and made him more defensive.

Beyond that, the only thing I can think of is probing the waters in the same way a lot of people do when trying to open up to their parents: don’t make it about him. Mention a celebrity who transitioned in an approving way, or something to that effect, so that he knows you generally don’t have a problem with trans people.

Best of luck to your family. It sounds like you’re doing your best to be a good parent.
He is only 8. So my only advice is: don't worry. In all likelihood, he's not yet capable of actually understanding the full ramifications here. Even if he already knows he wants to be a girl, there's no need to force him into talking about things. Let him come to you when he's ready. And perhaps he hasn't even figured things out for himself anyway. Just be supportive and loving. That's all he needs right now.
I'd like to commend a lot of the comments in seeing.

First, keep loving your child unconditionally. Even if they don't show it now, it will be the most important thing you can do for them.

Second, therapy is probably a great idea. I don't like the idea of therapy being for something wrong with you. Approach it by saying you'd like to help your child find a safe adult to talk with. Emphasize that what they talk about with a therapist, stays between the two of them. Therapy isn't about ""fixing"" anything, but about understanding yourself. Nobody needs to know about it outside of your house.

Again, just love your child. Encourage exploration in general. Don't press on this subject. Do keep tabs on online activity and only address concerning behavior (self harm or risky people/communities). Think about having an age appropriate cyber safety discussion so they understand the sorts of things that are safe and the ones that aren't.
If only more parents had this patience and understanding. You’re already off to a great start, and I can only agree with the advice here but you have my respect~ 💜
wow. if I had the internet at that age im sure my searches would have been similar. Until I learned the word trans I thought I was extremely unusual for having the feelings that I did. Unfortunately my first exposure to the word was via negative media portrayal and probably hampered my ability to process and understand my feelings for some time. 

I’m wondering if your kid knows the word trans yet or knows that there are other people out there who feel the way they do or that transition is even a possibility. As a “good kid” I can tell you that we need permission, even to explore and act on our deepest desires. I worry a little bit that when you told them you just wanted them to “stay the same human” it might have been misinterpreted to mean “not change into a girl” - i obviously wasnt there and dont know the full context or your relationship, that is just something i could see myself doing. Even with the construction of “stay a wonderful human being.” There is obviously some shame they have from somewhere associated with these feelings so “wonderful human being” to them might get interpreted as “not someone who wants to switch bodies and become a girl” even if that isn’t at all what you meant. If it comes up again maybe try and explain that there are people who do just that, and that the word for it is transgender. Be affirming, but knowing how i would have reacted as a kid, i would avoid the “stay” language going forward. 

Its so heartwarming to see you seeking out advice from this community, your kid is lucky. :)
Ohhh they are still 8, there is still loads of time and experience to be gained, get him a trans specialized psychologist
You are already off to an amazing start. Your child is most definitely going through something, and it you just being there and telling your child you love them no matter what, is probably very helpful. A lot of parents wouldn't do the same, some even would react very negatively to what you caught them watching/doing. Therapy sounds like a great idea, even if it's just a check up on how they're doing, however extremely important that it's in a trans positive space. If you don't want to jump into therapy straight away you can try watching some queer/trans positive documentaries or shows, and just lay it on that you completely support the idea of such things.
I wish i had a parent like you when I was young. You're doing great so far, just give them space and help where you can. Try not to push too hard as they're likely working through their feelings in their own time.

Wish your family all the best 💕
Your child probably is trans. That doesn't mean that they are ready to talk about it. You seem to have this idea that if there's something going on, it needs to be addressed and dealt with and put in a fancy package right now. It doesn't. Let things happen naturally.

Some things you can and should do: make sure your child knows there are trans people in the world--that it's possible to live a nice happy life as a trans person. Let them know you admire and appreciate trans people. If you can arrange for them to meet a trans person, that would be great. 

But remember, your child is only 8. There's no rush. And it's not for you to decide who they need to be.
As many have already stated, therapy is always an excellent option, as long as it's presented in the tight way

I imagine that your child is going through a lot of anxiety trying to process the emotions they're feeling about their identity, and at this particular point in time, patience may be your best option. 

Children can often feel a great a amount of duress when asked about things they're not ready to talk about. Their environment also plays a major part in their thought process and behaviors. As long as you continue to be loving to your child and you provide them with an environment they feel accepted in, they will eventually have the courage to speak about this topic. 

As others have stated, it will likely help to have conversations that paint your views on trans people in a positive light. If your child is transgender, and has seen with their own eyes that you're accepting of trans people, they will eventually feel comfortable opening up.
You’re both wonderful parents for caring and trying so hard. I get where the kid is coming from though with the absolute hysterics when they’re confronted about it though. I imagine it’d feel like the parents know something “private” about them that they weren’t ready to share, that the discussion about it is overwhelming because they’re just trying to figure out who they are, and honestly just being 8 can be hard. So you’re doing all the right stuff in letting your kid know they’re loved, but it’s ok to also back off and let em know the ball is in their court. You’ve tried to talk with them, they’re not having it. When they’re ready I’m sure they’ll find a way to talk about it with you. Try to make your household as inclusive as possible (gender neutral language like “they” instead of “he or she” when possible and using “server” instead of “waiter and waitress”, having a mix of traditionally “girls” and “boys” toys, not needlessly gendering things like colours). If you put in the effort to normalize dismantling the binary system, your kid might not feel scared about figuring out their gender. Also bring up queer and trans topics like it’s casual - aka note the victories of queer or trans actors when you see a movie, let them watch shows that discuss these topics (obvi age appropriate) or about how trans people have made strides with sports, and just subtly give them resources without seeming like you did it. The fact you’re trying to reach out to the community speaks volumes - you are good parents trying to help. Listen to and validate the kid as they grow up (and do the work on your end aka go to support meetings of parents of trans/queer kids, educate yourselves about trans realities, look into what options there are for their future (as puberty approaches, hormone blockers may help. Definitely research that though) and try to take a look at what expectations you have of your child’s life as a parent and try to detach those from gender as best you can) and I’m sure they will be ok.
I would say give the kid the space and privacy they want to figure out what they need to. Gender identity takes a long time to be sure of, and even if you have the best of intentions, prying or seeking things that a kid wants to keep private for now only erodes trust, at least in my experience. Best advice I can give is to give time and support without intrusion. Make it clear that you're supportive and educated about trans identities, but don't pressure your little one into breaking out of their comfort zone before they're ready.
Much love to you all, you've absolutely done the right thing asking a forum full of trans people! I think you're gonna do great, if your kid is trans or not ♥️
So my mother (using her as an example) isint the best with this sort of thing so when I came out I thought she would be the easier one to come out to and turns out I was wrong she uses my dead name she try’s to gender me correctly but often says what I was born as and ya know mabye I’m not the best at giving advice for theses sorts of things but one thing I can say about her is she constantly reminds me that she loves me which is why I can live with her not fully going with it she’s constantly  supportive she’s always there for me and I feel in any situation that’s the best thing u can do is just remind your child hey no matter what happenes I love u so much cause for me it’s idc most of the time when my mother miss genders or miss names me cause it’s hard for her but she’s supportive in other ways so I guess 

TLDR just be there for them and Remeber it’s ok to be scared and that their happiness means everything
[deleted]
Don’t pressure just listen
Your child is naturally very very scared and confused about what is happening.

First, stop pressuring them to talk. They will talk when they are ready. (Since we dont know what is going on, they/them are pronouns for an NB).

Second, your wife can do a little experiment. She can take them to the nail salon with her. Get them a manicure/pedicure with polish of their choice. When they get home, act like its completely normal (which it is!). And then watch and see what happens.

Regardless of how much you want to talk about it, pressuring them is possibly being too confrontational. If you do little things to show its OK, like a trip to the salon, and maybe some female styled clothes they can wear around the house, you will gain trust and eventually get where you want to go. 

Youre not going to get there directly, trust me. Youre going to kinda have to sneak up to it and just let them open up bit by bit, at their pace.
Maybe make a simple gesture to demonstrate your support, but don't make a big deal out of it. He's interested in makeup right? Maybe get him a starter, kids friendly makeup kit. 8 year olds don't have a lot of money, and makeup is something that he's really curious about. Leave it in his room with a note that says ""We love you, Mom and Dad"". You don't have to bring it up unless he brings it up. This should help him really internalize the idea that you're willing to give him his space, but also that you're fully supportive.

He's going to do a lot better with your support. Trans youths tend to be VERY vulnerable. The internet has lots of great resources for trans youths, but it also is full of perverts, predators and porn. The biggest worry I have is for a naive kid to accidentally fall into online communities that don't have his best interests in mind, that might warp his view of things or worse. Loving, supportive parents are the #1 ally a trans kid can have, and if he feels comfortable coming to you with stuff he'll be less likely to seek out his answers from potentially dangerous internet sources.

tl;dr - Get him some makeup, don't make a big deal about it, hopefully that will be the olive branch he needs to see that you really are supportive.
Will you be my dad also?   

For real though, you're an awesome father and your child is super fortunate to have you.
I think that if uou take him to a therapist (which I totally recommend) I'd couch it in terms of ""Sometimes we have big things we're thinking about but don't know how to talk about them. We'd like you to chat with a friend of ours. Maybe they can help you find ways to give words to your big thoughts.""

Eight is a hard age. You're really starting to realize you're a person. And you've got BIG feelings. At that age, they just want to be like their peers and have fun. When they've got big feelings it's hard to know what to do with them. 

Maybe it'll shake out that he just wants to be more accepted by his female peers. Maybe he just thinks body swaps are cool and can't figure out why. 

He sounds like he's scared and overwhelmed. Getting a child therapist who can let him participate in at therapy and play therapy could be super good for him. And, that therapist may be able to help you all learn how to communicate about big feelings. 

I'd also recommend not pushing the subject. Focus on the reactions. ""Hey, buddy, I see we're having some big feelings. What can we do with our feelings so we can calm down a bit?"" At that age my son and I focused on tapping, deep breaths, and safe ways to express violent reactions (punching pillows, running, wild dancing.)

You're doing your best. Keep doing it.

Also, [here](https://youtu.be/d3M2kd_VmeM) is a wonderful video about a sweet, little, trans girl. Maybe bring able to see himself in a kid his age may help him too.
It’s no issue asking for advice here, in fact, good on you for making an effort for your child. 

If he’s freaking out over the idea of talking to you about it, then it’s likely he’s still working it all out in his head. He’s a child, so the idea he’s in the wrong body or wants to have the experiences of a girl would be confusing as hell to him. 

I’d say the only thing you can do wrong is to jump to black and white conclusions. Instantly trying to get him to confess his feelings would only make him feel like he has to choose. I would suggest letting him continue to explore these ideas while also trying to get him to talk to a therapist that can help him work through those feelings in a safe environment. I know for a fact that when I was question whether I was a girl or not, the only thing made me realize my path was a lot of time, and the proper resources to figure it out.

In short, don’t hold him back from his own independent discovery. Let him know that it’s okay to talk about these things in your household without shame. If he asks for thing like makeup or toys/clothes meant for girls, let him get it. Nothing bad can come from the tools and freedom to help these confusing feelings. 

It’s okay if he doesn’t want to choose what he wants to be right now. It’s okay if he has the time to find himself. As a parent, you should let him know that all of this is okay. All of it is normal and doesn’t have to be scary. Show him that he can figure these things out for himself, but also show him that he isn’t alone in this journey.

I hope that helps. As a former boy who’s become a woman now, it’s what I would have wanted when I was his age.
Patience. Understanding and love. Sounds like you’re a good parent already.
Coming from someone who often feels bullied into talking to my parents about things I don't want to, I would say not to try and force a conversation. Let them come to you when they are ready to talk.

Just let them know they don't need to feel embarassed for exploring and that they can talk to you about it with no judgement when they're ready.

I would even advise not to get proactive with things like sugesting to buy affirming clothes, although someone's suggestion about a book seems like a nice enough idea
I think seeeing as he’s only eight wait a few years and then he might have figured it out.
I used to non binary then trans then gender fluid and I’ve only just realised I’m trans
Your child is reacting the exact same way I did whenever my parents confronted me or tried to talk to me about these things, at the exact same age. Stop. Its already traumatized them because they don't know how to express themself at what is a very confusing point of realization for them, and I can guarantee its stressing them out. 

Let them tell you on their terms, you're doing the equivalent of outing them because its making you uncomfortable.
Oh, this letter so touched my heart, and made me weep at the sheer beauty of the dynamic between you and your daughter. 

And you know that's whom she is. 

All I can tell you is to just give her space. And time. Her egg is cracking--which is how we transgender people describe the process  of finally realizing who we are and beginning the coming out process. She knows whom she is, and what she is, but right now she's trying to find the vocabulary to tell you and your wife.

She will tell you at some point, and probably not too far in the future. Because her dysphoria is coning to a head. She's hurting inside, and is absolutely terrified that she will disappoint you and your wife. 

So do what you're doing. Tell her over and over and over that you love her unconditionally. That you will always be proud of who she is, and that you and your wife will always be there for her, and will always support her. 

However, your wife is dead wrong about her being too young to know who she is. She KNOWS--and is either trying to prove to herself that she  ISN""T whom she's 99% sure she is, or she's looking on the Internet for validation and reassurance. 

She absolutely would benefit from seeing a therapist, but please--find the best gender therapist in your area for her when the time is right. It will make all the difference in the world. And preferably, I'd suggest someone who is LGBTQIA+ and/or a female. Your daughter will absolutely feel more open with a woman, and not be intimidated by the often intimidating male imperative.

And finally, I will tell you that your daughter is incredibly lucky to have yiunadyiur wife asbher parents. SOOOO many trans kids live in abject terror that they'll come out to their families and be disowned or endlessly shamed. 

So, be strong. Your family dynamic is in a rough patch right now. And the confusion and fear you and your wife might be experiencing  right now is nothing compared to what your daughters is feeling. 

Let her feel her own way for a bit. Don't confront her about her research or viewing habits. She's exploring. Let her know that she is free to experiment with clothing, makeup, longer hair, and that she's living in a no-judgment zone right now. 

You'll get through this. And so will she. It's not going to be easy. But with you at her side, she's going to grow up to be an amazing young woman.

Good luck!!! Many, MANY blessings.....
Maybe start letting him choose the clothes he wants and letting him know if he wants stuff from the girl section thats ok, he might still be working through it and small stuff like that could help him know he'll be supported either way
This is so wholesome it made my day. I don’t have enough experience on the topic to give advice except to be loving and affirming to his wishes, but seeing how you’re doing thats not a problem.

I hope it works out for him no matter what he chooses!
Oh my god. I wish OP a wonderful fucking life. You are such a fucking good dad. I wish my dad had the same philosophies about things. May your child grow up to be whatever they want to be whilst keeping in touch and being on good terms with you.
Maybe buy him some girls cloths and make up and a do not disturb sign for his door. Promise him if he puts the sign up that you will not come in to his room. This way he has some time to explore on his own. It will show you are supportive without having to talk about it. And also the idea of the books that other people have said. That way you can help make sure the info he gets it's positive and accurate. There are some trans documentaries of kids on prime and youtube
It sounds to me like if he is googling these things and freaking out like this every time you want him to open up, he may have already been exposed to transphobia online. He might have it in his head that you, like many other parents, would outcast him or hate him if he comes out as a trans girl. This wouldnt be your fault from what i am understanding and i do ask that you do not take away his options of research, he might feel that the internet is the only safe place for him to look this up. 

Maybe do something to show you support people who do transition. He is an 8 year old child, so maybe stage a conversation with your wife. In front of your child, talk about someone who you heard of who transitioned (this is a stage conversation- feel very free to lie, make someone up). It might be even better if you make it about a trans woman so that it can reflect your son's ideas better. Talk about how ""oh, linda is so pretty, ever since she realized shes a woman shes been much happier and im glad to see it"". 

Im not sure if there are any trans-educational books for children (there probably are) but maybe get him one after doing some research on good inclusive ones. Ask him if he wants you to buy him makeup and show him how to apply it. Rather than push him into forcing himself to explain (which is scary enough for trans adults, let alone a child who may have been exposed to transphobia already) perhaps offer him avenues to experiment
Based on my own childhood, you're definitely coming at this from the right direction, though possibly coming on a bit strong.

I was around that age when I started questioning my gender, and if I'd been confronted by my parents about it, I imagine I'd have reacted similar to your child.  I was deeply ashamed, didn't have a clear idea of even *what* I was thinking let alone why, and basically was generally confused and terrified.

This was 25 years ago, so online resources were limited at best, and social awareness / representation was even worse than it is now, and generally I do lament how this impacted my own path (i only started to actually accept myself and begin coming out earlier this year, after decades of severe depression and dissociation).  For this reason, I fully commend your efforts to help your child through their self-discovery, but let them move at a pace that is comfortable to them.  

And, as others have stated, make sure you do your research.  Part of why my own journey has taken as long as it has is because when I did eventually reach out for information, what I received was a very limited perspective presented as the only description of trans people (it was a mix of the ""trapped in the wrong body"" and ""always known without a shadow of a doubt"" stereotypes), and because I didn't fit that perfectly I concluded I must not be trans (and used this same thinking to reject the idea every time I came back to it over the years).
Just love and support your child. Ensure that they feel free and safe to talk about anything with your actions, acceptance and love. 
Let your child lead the way and feel free to explore.  

Hang in there.
It might be just a phase . As lot of us that are trans begin to realize when we hit puberty around 12 to 14. It's like the hormones start flowing and the wiring is all wrong.
The way you describe him 🥺🥺

He’s so very lucky to have you
Something that really slowed me down was never knowing a trans woman. There’s a lot of good advice in this thread, but simply knowing someone who’s trans may be the thing that lets him know it’s real and ok to want this. Good luck!
Small tidbit of advice that you can use now just in case. Instead of calling them things like “son” or “my boy” try to use things that aren’t gendered like “child” or “my kid”. Just a little thing that helps and doesn’t make it seem like you’re… idk how to say it… gendering them I guess. Sry if that’s really vague or not helpful I’m just trying to help.
As a trans woman and parent of an eight year old boy, this really made me tear up.  
I feel like maybe your wife is on track with the psychologist idea but I don’t know.  Parenting is difficult at times no matter how much we love and support them.
Your child has plenty of time to figure it out. Just go at their pace. You’re doing things just fine. If you want them to open up more. Try little things instead of conversations. If you like going out to get your nails done. Maybe invite them next time? Or the next time you take them shopping for clothes see if they’re intereeed in anything in the girls section. I wish I was so aware of these things at 8.
Does your wife paint her nails? especially somewhere your kid could happen to see? curiosity/fascination usually overcomes fear/shame. They might come over, a conversation may start... something something.... your kids nails are now painted, they look fab, they're happy, you parents are happy.... keep expanding the dialog, make things interesting.

Makeup? nope not yet don't think so...face paint(s) with glitter could be on the cards (any party's, events, shows, Other reasons to get glammed up?)

Clothes shopping.. don't take them shopping for a particular gender of clothes for themself (well clothes have no gender, but society goes to great lengths to shame anyone who would step outside the status quo) Go shopping as a family, Also everyone tries on everything... even the dinosaur costume RAAWWW
I’m not gonna be useful because I really don’t know how to help you, parent sided.
I just wanna say that I literally cried while reading this love and support masterpiece. I really would’ve loved and needed my mother to be so careful and trying to make me happy. 
I’m a trans woman, 16 years old and just wanted to thank you about that. Your child, whatever their gender is or will be, has great parents and an amazing luck. It makes me happy to know every parent isn’t like mine. 
I wish you to find out if they’re trans, and if they’re, I really believe you’ll help them as much as a parent can.
You’re a great parent and I wish more people had their parents paying so much attention to their well-being and being so supportive. I wish you the best.
I don't really have much to contribute that hasn't already been said so I'll just react with this.

Whatever ends up happening, just keep calm or you might freak them out. There are years before damage from not transitioning if your child wants to could start. Just be patient and let them explore themselves without being pushy, there is plenty of time for them to work things out.

Just keep reminding them that you love them and will no matter who they grow up to be.
Maybe like find something trans positive and watch with your kid, make comments thru it that make your support clear. Your kid might be afraid of being rejected even if you have expressed some positive attitudes in the past. Making it 100% explicitly clear that you’d be supportive and happy for them if they transitioned would probably help them relax
Do you have access to trans adults? Is there an lgbt center or even an online space where he can be around adult trans people?

My little brother is 12 and just came out as trans a year ago. It’s scary. He needed me to be there for him and help him come out, and it was ROUGH. Even though my mom’s always been supportive (I’m a lesbian), she really struggled to accept my brother. 

He probably knows you won’t disown him or anything, but he’s probably terrified you won’t love him as much or won’t adjust or will miss your son. 

He also is probably terrified himself - being trans is hard. Being a trans woman is harder, and who knows how his friends talk about lgbt people. 

You guys are being great parents. Try and get him around lgbt adults he can look up to, take it slow, and let him open up to you about it. Being around non-related lgbt adults could really help him.
Everyone on this sub would do anything for a parent like you
The best thing you can do is be there and be unjudgemental. Be there for them and offer your support in any way possible.
Maybe the way you're confronting him makes him think he'll be in trouble. Make it clear that you'll accept him if this is the case. (Unless you won't accept him then that's something else) But just let him know that your love won't change and he should open up about it.
Do you question him about everything he does the way you have described here, or only on matters pertaining to “body swapping” etc. something is ringing false for me here and I’m not quite sure what. Your wife is a psychologist? Perhaps as parents you should seek support for yourself first. Children are curious and creative creatures. 8 is a magical age. Stop making him “hysterical” with this questioning would be my 2nd suggestion.
Sounds like your suspicions are pretty accurate to what’s going on. That’s being said, they are only 8 now. The time to really press for questions would be right before puberty. An 8 year old is still kind of far from that, and is just really young in general. I’d just watch and be as accepting as possible. Don’t press too much on questions if it makes them hysterical. Just love them and make it be known they can be who they want to be.
 I can remember being 8 and having a difficult negotiation with my mom about the long coat I wanted (So. California, go figure, but the girls had them) where I was hyper aware of the need to conceal and settle for a masculine style, which sadly I still do.  Also 8/9 brought my first experiences with gender envy mixed up with attraction, and 9, in my particular case, wouldn't have been too soon for blockers.  So, I would have benefited from parents as sophisticated as OP, and professional help, though I agree this isn't a time to imply the child is 'sick'
Please do not force your child into conversations they are uncomfortable with. It isn't going to help even if it feels that way

I have a few questions to steer your thinking. I know they feel confrontational but that's not what I mean by it

Can you find ways to show them that being trans is okay and wonderful? Not just tell them, show them?

Can you find resources that teach them about gender and LGBT identities? Do they even know that trans people exist?
Hard to say at his age. Looking things up and watching things on tv could be curiosity because trans is in the media so much. AT this time, transition for him wouldn't be medical, he'd just start wearing whatevrer sort of clothes he wants to wear.

You could ask him to draw a picture of himself when he's a grownup. Or ask him what he wants to be when he grows up and ask a few probing questions like where he would live, what would he do, what would he look like, how tall, what kind of hairstyle, what kind of pets, what would he wear to work. Put all those things in the picture. 

You can just wait this out. Don't make a big deal out of it and wait for him to make decisions. He won't be old enough for puberty blockers for several years.
I don't nessesscarily have much to add that hasn't already been said, but I just want to say you are an amazing parent and you are a model for how every parent should treat this ""issue"" with your kid.  

My parents are supportive of me now at 26 and were never explicitly transphobic, but they never did anything that allowed me to explore my gender and later sexual identity.  They did things whether or not was intentional that implied who I was and what I wanted to be was wrong.  It was stuff like pushing me to play football and rugby when I wanted to do swimming and running, discouraging me from wearing feminine colors like light blue or pink or purple, or even stuff as ridiculous as ""...when you marry a beautiful Irish girl and provide us with a bunch of grandkids..."".  Of course at a certain point all of it stopped but it definitely discouraged me from telling them when I started having these feeling at 10 and waiting until I was 25 to start hormones. 

My point is you are an amazing parent and are doing the right thing.  Let your child explore who they want to be and support them.  Also you will almost certainly get pushback from transphobic and homophobic parents, **don't let their judgement sway you or your kid's want to do this**.
100% give your child the space they need to explore their gender identity.  You can do subtle things to let them know you are an ally, not just to them, but the LGBTQIA+ community as a whole.  Go to a local Pride event.  Support a local business because of their outward LGBT expression.  Wear a pin, bracelet, or necklace that affirms you are part of the community to everyone.

It is wonderful that you have attempted to give your child the reassurance that you love them no matter what, but it's very possible that society has given them the idea they should be ashamed of who they are, and they need to work through some of that on their own.
These comments are great but why are we all calling them ‘him’ or ‘son’. It seems quite likely that the kid would eventually want to go by she/her pronouns and be seen as a girl, so at least for now we should use neutral language until they figure that out- people o  no this sub are usually so conscientious about this kind of thing, I’m really surprised
I am your best buddy from college. Here, sit down and have a beer with me and I will tell you something you need to hear.

Just WAIT, my dude! Jeez! You're trying to force him to come out to you on YOUR timeline. Please stop worrying so much. Stop prying. Stop spying. Let the human be. I know you're trying your best, but you're trying way too hard. You can't do this for him. He has to do it on his own, on his own terms. CHILL BRO! Be PATIENT. Talk about literally anything else with him. Ice cream, movies, dogs... Anything! But! This!

Said with gentleness and love.
If he's freaking out like this I'd interpret it as he's still working out some things and maybe doesn't have an answer. Conversely, he could definitely want to be a girl but be afraid to tell you because even at that young age, children learn what they are supposed to be. Personally, my suggestion is give him a bit of time to learn and explore. If then he still is freaking out, maybe go see a psychologist just to try and understand.
Your child is very lucky to have you. I have no advice  but Good luck and congrats on being a good human yourself!
So, confrontation is not the way to go, lots of us have a lot of fear around things like this and have a bunch of repression. I would say that you should let your child know that if they want to be a girl that it is okay, and that you will love and support them no matter what. Since that genuinely seems to be your stance.

If you want to take it a step further you could go for therapy, or you could offer to help them explore this part of their self. Something really easy to do would be ask them if they would like it or if it would be okay if you called them daughter. I know that if my mother or father started doing that without me asking I would smile the whole day. Maybe offer to get them something girly and see how they like it. (it reinforces gender norms but in this case that's okay). You need to make them feel comfortable and safe enough to explore who they are. You being in on the idea helps to do that.

Your wife thinks that you shouldn't make any guesses, you shouldn't. Eight year old's are at the age where they start to understand gender and what it means, it's common for kids to start realizing something is wrong around this age. All you need to do is give them the right environment to find themselves in. You have years to do this so you can be very gentle about it. Instead of ""catching them in the act"" and then talking to them when they are in a state of panic bring it up somewhere open and neutral and don't push too hard. It is very easy to feel cornered and that isn't what you want to do.

Your child as much as you probably doesn't know or understand where they are at yet, I certainly didn't when I started questioning and I was 18. I'll say it again, explore it with them and make certain they know that you will be accepting. Actions speak louder than words here, there's no need to be super serious, if they justify it as being fun, then treat it as fun, anything to get them more open and happy around the idea. When you can have a dialogue then you can ask questions and get answers.

Another thing you can do is leave it alone for a bit. Let them explore for themselves, which is what they are doing, and then when they are ready they might come to you with it, or at least they might not be as scared.
Okay, so the first thing is that you're being a great parent for being so open and loving towards your child.  

Beyond that, give him time.  He may need time to sort out the feelings in his own head.  At eight years old, he's got time before puberty starts kicking in, so there isn't a rush on it.  Make sure you let him know that you love him, and will continue to do so no matter what, and make sure he knows that what he's looking at is okay and that you'd love to talk to him when he's ready.

As mentioned below, there are a lot of books you can get, and I highly recommend them as well.
Except them for who they are. Make sure that they know that they can talk to you about anything without judgment. When they come out to you tell them that you love them unconditionally.
I'm sorry but I have to be brutally honest. I couldn't finish readying because I was getting an anxiety attack. Please do not inject yourself so much in your kids personal life, it feels like they don't have any freedom. And if you see that he is feeling anxius and panicking with the topic just stop, don't force them. A simple ""If you want to talk about something feel free to do so"" is enough. 

And don't do the questions, it feels like you are under investigation about things you don't even understand. You are forcing them into the closet if they are actually trans, you are taking control over their own life. And I kinda feel like you know this but you keep going because you are scared and them shutting down will be easier for you to deal with.
Yes. Exactly that.
And a therapist isnt because smth is wrong with him. It is a point of view I see often, but talking to someone professional can help everyone.
I will buy it thank you!
>w much we loved him, but then got so panicked and hysterical again when we tried to get him to talk to us. We told him ag

I read that when I was like 17 was an adorable heartwarming story.

Thank you I’m really upset about this I don’t want him to feel alone and afraid. I’d do anything to stop that honestly.
Personally I would never send my kid (who's about the same age and might very well also be experiencing gender incongruity) to therapy over something they're not ready yet to talk about. As a teacher, I can tell you this: therapy is often  experienced as punishment by younger kids. And merely sending him there could be the beginning of making your child feel different.

If the child doesn't want to talk about it, then don't force his hand. Instead work on being a loving and accepting parent and making him feel safe to talk about anything, even difficult stuff to you. I can guarantee you he'll eventually open up to you, IF he really feels that way and isn't just curious about his budding sense of gender and sexuality.
Thank you so much we recognise some things in this! Thank you for your advice best wishes
Ok so you don’t think that it will make him think that we think there is something wrong with him like ‘oh you have a problem you must see someone’? 

I absolutely won’t lose sight of who he is, ever. I have very strong feelings about supporting him no matter what and I know he is the same person no matter what. Thank you.
Hi you are right about the “deciding” thing. I know it’s not a choice but you are right I have used that terminology and I will be careful not to and rephrase from now on! Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for your comment yeah I’m freaking out here but I just want to do the right thing by my child and be the best father I can be to help.
Thank you so much for this there is great advice here and I will take it. It is a good question about where that Shane has come from. I am confident it’s not from my wife and I and his sister because we are very big on acceptance and my rule is that all that matters is if we believe someone has a good heart and is good to the world and others and that is all that matters in the end. I know life is more nuanced and we need to be but I will make sure I support my (currently) little boy to be his/her true self. And thanks again for the advice I’m really grateful and will show my wife everyone’s response her it’s been very supportive.
I do see your point regarding my choice of words but to be clear I don’t believe it is a choice. I will make sure he/she knows that.
I know, I don’t think it’s a choice. Trust me he/she will be supported to be his/her authentic self. Always.
Thank you that’s so nice to hear but at the same time I’m sorry you didn’t have that and I hope life is good now for you. Sending love your way
Thank you so much and best wishes it has really helped making this post I’m glad I did it.
Thank you I will do this.
Any good mental health professional is only going to help a child, not cause them issues. Issues usually come from a therapist with an agenda, or people in the child's life who are shaming them for needing to see one in the first place.
I don’t know for sure but I think so. I’m pretty sure my wife and I have told him because we have taken time to tell him about who knows you may marry a boy or a girl or you may never get married and that’s ok! And that was before any of the events in this post. I’m pretty sure we told him that some people born one gender discover they are in fact another but I don’t know if we really explained it properly. I try to drop these things I to natural conversation because I want them to understand them as completely normal and not something I need to just sit down and have a ‘serious’ discussion about. We really try on this stuff. I won’t say we always get it right but we have certainly tried to. 

Thx for your comment though because I will find a way to naturally drop this into a discussion one day so there is some context and it’s just no big deal just people being who they are and a regular part of life. You are right this may help. Thank you.
Thanks so much I so appreciate the advice. We have that one thing covered that’s for sure because our live for them comes naturally no matter what. The rest I guess we take one step at a time. Thank you!

Will do!
I appreciate the honesty, thank you for your feedback
Right but the worry seems to be the child's perception
hopping on this thread to[recommend this book,](https://www.chroniclebooks.com/products/seeing-gender) which I found a very educational and age-appropriate introduction to gender identities and would share with my kids when i worked at youth shelters

&#x200B;

this one is more sex-ed oriented and frankly a bit cornier but is also a good resource: [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43822305-wait-what](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43822305-wait-what)
Scholastic is going to change the title for the new edition, but I’m not sure when that’s coming out
What I would do would be to see if they want to go shopping for some girls clothing and toys and whatnot? And if not maybe pick them up a few things just to see.  Just little nudges to loose them up to show them as you have that you're a complete ally.  I think you are doing a great job.  But if someone had gone that extra step to help me buy some things, its like throwing out an arm of trust that you can latch on to.  I feel like I could have told people when I was younger.  Huggles though any which way you'll figure this out!

But something as simple as bringing them home some girls pajamas, a skirt or a dress might be an amazing opener for them.  Things at their age a regular girl might have.  Pajamas can be really normal but very girly and since its sleep cloths they can have the comfort its for them privately at home where no one else might scrutinize.
I second the other poster saying therapy might be jumping the gun, especially for an 8 year old who's just starting to figure themselves out. If your kid doesn't want to talk, then you need to be fine with that.

Maybe have a sit down and explain to them that you love them, will support them no matter what, and that they can talk to you about anything and if they decide they want to experiment with anything, that you'll help them. Don't try to force them to respond positively or negatively or talk about it further, just tell them that and let them be.

Maybe your kid is trans, maybe your kid is gay, maybe your kid is honestly just interested in makeup and doesn't have much interest in their gender identity otherwise, but regardless, they need to be allowed time to figure it out themselves before they can even get close to explaining it to you.

Be the corny parents and give them the uncomfortable but reassuring 'we love you and support you' speech and then just back off and give them space, but jumping straight to therapy is just going to drive them away. If and when they bring up the subject, then you go from there.
Hey OP, clearly my comment took off and has sparked a lot of discussion. I'm definitely not the only person with valid thoughts and points, so make sure to read through the thread and not just who replies to you. 

Keep up the good work, you're doing great. I really hope you're found something to help you out.
While your point is understandable, that you don’t want to force your child to talk about certain topics that they’re not ready for, im going to tell you what I believe would be helpful, as someone who has been in that child’s shoes. My parents largely avoided therapy until I was openly suicidal, and I will tell you, I needed it *years* sooner. Therapy can offer a neutral ground to discuss topics that would otherwise seem scary or dangerous to discuss with parents, and can often offer a neutral person just to talk about. The biggest part to remember is to be able to find a good therapist your child is comfortable with, and to let what gets talked about in therapy stay between the therapist and the child unless it’s an active risk to safety. (It’s also important to note, if your partner is a psychologist, I’d recommend making sure they’re out side of your partner’s organisation, so that you don’t have problems with invasion of privacy and trust issues in the future) If you do decide to go this route, I’d say give him a chance to refuse therapy if he wants, then respect that. Show him that it’s an open choice, and an attempt to help, not a punishment. You can let him know he can always change his mind as well if he says no. 

On your other point though, I agree. If you feel your child is uncomfortable and scared, I think it’s important to let him know it’s safe, then allow him to think it over for himself. From what it sounds like it’s an issue that needs to work itself out on it’s own, and it’s not like it’s a danger to him like depression or bullying in school. If you really want, you can offer outlets, and introduce trans friends if you have them, do some research into local LGBT groups, do what research you can about trans issues and introduce trans role models if you can. Allow him to set the boundaries, then respect them. With all this said, I think you’re doing incredible as is in all honesty. You’re showing concern and you’re trying to respect him as you can. It’s a difficult balance. But as other users have said, the sheer fact that you are showing him you love him still no matter what choices he makes with his self expression is amazing.
While I agree with what you're saying. Maybe trying it out wouldn't be so bad? Like if it doesn't seem it's helpful after a few visits, maybe just quit for the time being? 

But I do think communicating to the child that it's not punishment, it's meant to be a safe place to talk, can go a long way in making them feel better about it.

It's OPs kid, they know their child best. I'm sure they could figure something out.

My bro was sent to therapy for ADHD as a kid. Definitely felt like punishment, it was stupid. I think had the adults and ""professionals"" been better at communicating and working with my bro, it might actually have helped a lot.
The therapist doesn’t have to be just for being trans. You can get your kid a therapist just so they have someone to talk to. They don’t have to talk about being trans, they can open up about whatever they’re comfortable about. And if being trans comes up, so be it
I think this is an interesting point, but one that says more about how we view therapy/counselling rather than being trans necessarily. I think if you do decide to set them up with a trans friendly counsellor/therapist, you shouldn’t indicate that you’re getting them to see a counsellor to find out if they’re trans. Instead, the counselling should be about helping them to communicate and process the emotional outbursts which seem to be happening. 

I have a counsellor I speak to every couple of weeks. I first started seeing her because I was beginning to understand that I’m trans and didn’t know what to do or how to figure out who I was. But we didn’t talk about my trans identity for the first couple of months, and she never pressured me to talk about it or even asked. First, we dealt with some of the issues I had with my parents and my wider sense of self, my ability to assess my own needs/emotions and take care of myself, and issues in my relationship. These were the foundations I needed in place to properly explore and start to understand my gender. It may well be that counselling can provide your child with confidence in recognising and understanding their emotions in order to process them, which will help them understand their gender in turn.
Therapists are trained to be warm and welcoming. When paired well they can be a great confidant that can help someone open up, its nothing like sending a kid to see the principal.
That's exactly what he'll think. As a general rule: never send your child to therapy unless there's actually something mentally wrong with him or her. That's clearly not the case here. Your son has only recently started actively exploring his gender identity and perhaps his sexuality. A lot of things are confusing to any 8-year-old and 99.9% of these are things the kids want to and need to work out for themselves. He'll open up to you eventually if anything's really up. Until then: cultivate a loving and open relationship within your family and the rest will follow automatically. Also make sure to point out how you're against discrimination of any kind - talk about that with him.

Even if your son told you he wants to be a girl: you can't really do that much at this time. Nobody will begin HRT at this age
The love you feel for your child shines so bright through your words. Some days when your doubting yourself and uncertain,  that love is what pushes you through.  We might not always know how to navigate through all life's challenges but that love will guide your way.
No worries, unlike a lot of my fellow trans people, I am fortunate enough to have a great and supportive family and I can tell you it makes the whole thing easier.

My only wish was that I had heard less jokes and discrimination against trans people growing up, that I had better trans representation in media growing up and that my family core had had more positive talk about LGBT people and issues growing up. 

They never were homophobic or transphobic, but the topics never came up so I didn't know what their instances on LGBT people were, which made me scared about coming out, for example some of my mom's best friends in college were a gay guy and a lesbian girl, if I had know that when I was a kid/teen rather than when I was 22, I would have probably seek my mom's support a lot earlier, but my family rarely speaks about any of these topics, at least until now because I am bringing the conversation forward and we have a much better relationship now because of it.

One last piece of advice. There's a recent Pixar movie called Luca, a lot of people have said it has a great gay allegory, but to me it felt more like a trans allegory to be honest and it's a great film to learn about inclusivity, in case you haven't watched it with your kid yet.
Yeah like the last part this guy said. I did exactly what your son is doing now when I was his age and I was first discovering YouTube. While I’m not trans (I like being both a man and a woman depending on the day), I did so much exploring with subjects like your son is searching. My dad checked my history was pisssssed. He’s more chill now but he did not give me the positive reinforcement you’re giving your son and I can’t emphasize enough how helpful that is
It's entirely possible that they told a (probably evangelical) friend or teacher and was told something along the lines of ""You'll go to hell and never see mom and dad again, you better not tell them!"" 

And they're using that reasoning to push you away from the issue cause ""If mom and dad don't know everything will be fine.""
You can use they/them for now if you're not sure what their gender is tbh
Key word being good. I personally wouldn't leave someone that young I'm the presence of any adult alone that I didn't know exceptionally well. Op doesn't have to listen to me. I'm only offering a different perspective.
No problem and also one other thing tell them that they can be whatever they want and they don’t have to tell you but can tell you anything and just leave it from there I know you think you are doing bad but you’re doing great and if anything I’d say you’re trying too hard so maybe try and lighten up otherwise it might makes them uncomfortable when talking about it let them come to you to talk about it and they’re only 8 so if they’re feeling gender dysphoria it can only be so bad but if they want feminine things try say yes like makeup and things like that obviously not loads but ye and plus if they’re 8 although you told them about trans they probably don’t fully understand it either and so when they’re my age or a bit younger so 12-13 ask them more about it then if they’re comfortable I told my mom recently it didn’t go the best but if you’re supportive always and don’t shame them for who they are everything should run smoothly just let them be who they want unless it’s a bad person but they sound like a good kid
Yeah, but if someone is unsure or it’s unclear, gender neutral pronouns (at least online) are the most respectful option imo…
That’s a good point. I just don’t want him to think he has done anything wrong or anything is wrong with him because there isn’t and I feel quite ferocious about that. On protecting him no matter what.
Ok this makes sense. I understand. He doesn’t have outbursts he is literally the most well behaved kid in the world. I love him so much would do anything for him and accept him as he is and I have told him that. Hasn’t helped though. Still no talking.
Ok will do thank you
I think this would make the kid upset, just trying to talk to him about it has made him hysterical. Imo you should use the pronouns you've used until the person tells you otherwise.
Agreed, and there are plenty of rubbish and truly harmful therapists out there. I just wanted to clarify that if you put the work in to ensure that the right therapist is chosen (trust but verify) and also create a therapy-positive environment for your children, it can go well.
Do you feel like your child's mental health is affected, though, so that it would warrant going to a therapist? Your care as a parent is obvious, I think, but sometimes children just need time for themselves to figure out their confusion or curiosity. Being openly confronted with issues like these can be a terribly uncomfortable experience, because a) it may be part of your own perceived sphere of privacy and intimacy being invaded - even as a small child - and b) if you haven't had any inner coming-out to yourself yet, meaning understanding and accepting yourself, talking to other people about an outer coming-out can just be awkward and embarassing. You made clear to your child that you're being supportive, that's the most important step. But forcing this issue onto them may be just counterproductive. I'd say be patient, give your child the freedom to come to terms with themselves - honestly, maybe he's also just a curious child having a phase googling stuff, who knows if not even him at the moment? - and be watchful if they actually show signs of getting mental problems with it. I do think a children's book that touches on the topic may be a great idea to help them deal with the topic on their own without shoving the issue in their face.
Just popping in to say that I was also a very 'well behaved kid'. A lot of that was only being taught to be well behaved and not necessarily how to communicate my feelings or transness. 

Especially since it was so hard to nail down as a genderfluid person, I would just generally shut down and block out people when they would question me as a kid because I literally didn't even have the vocabulary to describe my feelings. 
""Why, yes mother, your child is feeling quite agender today, please use they/them or we could even talk about neopronouns, thanks!"" Is probably not something I could have cooked up on my own at that age, but I desperately FELT that way. So I just had screaming meltdowns over small-sounding stuff like wearing girl jeans and completely shut down otherwise.

I think as long as therapy is framed as a good thing where you learn about yourself and how to communicate better, like going to get your teeth cleaned, or seeing the pediatrician, it's not seen as a punishment for doing something wrong, but rather like another thing we do to take care of ourselves and grow.
I guess that’s what I mean. There is something in the way of that communication, and it isn’t necessarily you or what you are telling them, or being trans at all… that’s what the therapist could help with. Removing that block to enable the communication, and to help the child decide when *they* are ready to talk about it.
Thank you I think you are right I don’t he possibly knows or he knows and doesn’t know how to vocalise it. And I will definitely make sure we pose any therapy in a positive light. Somehow. Not sure how I will do that but I will figure it out. Thank you.
The best thing to do is just stress that therapy doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you. It’s just a way to figure things out and learn more about yourself.

I will stress to make absolutely sure it’s a gender identity therapist, preferably one that has expensive working with kids. A general practitioner won’t be much help on this and it’s good that your wife recognizes that. Also if your child says they don’t like the therapist or doesn’t want to keep going, listen to them. You want a therapist that’s a good match.

I’ll also suggest to not push quite so hard to get your child to talk to you about it. Just assure them you love and accept them for who they are and will support them no matter what, and if they ever want to talk about any of this you will be there to listen. Then just leave it at that."	qwknv0	trans	909	0.98	2021-11-18 07:42:25

The wording has me confused, was she kidnapped from America and sent to Saudi?
I'm so fucking tired
Rest In Power
This isn’t right
She was so beautiful, too beautiful to die. The whole scenario is just so utterly disgusting, really evil. Sleep well Eden sorry girl!
Rest in Power Eden, I hate seeing so many of our sisters die and the lack of any media action
Rest in power our beautiful girl, we’ll all meet across the rainbow bridge in the sunless sea.
I've heard stories like that come from Lebanon. We've got it bad too .
I just sobbed for half an hour after reading her letter picturing her loss & terror. Obviously transphobia & special interests are the reasons why this type of trafficking & fraud is allowed & has been forever. Why do Americans, even conservatives, allow foreign nationals to enter the country for the purpose of scooping up marginalized residents to abuse & kill elsewhere under false pretenses?
Fly high Eden. You were an amazing person and you deserved so much better ♥️
🥺😢😢
I honestly can't sleep and on the verge of crying...

Being from the same country as her means that I (or any trans person from that shithole) could end up like this.


How is it my fault that I'm trans?

My Dad physically can’t remember that I’m a girl now.	"CW: Mortality.

So, my Dad is very very sick. Has been for the last three years. I learned I was trans at the tail end, and told my family.

Problem is, my Dad now cannot remember what he ate for breakfast. He’s on so many meds to function that he can’t… Well, function.

Silver lining, he’s sad every time I do tell him that he loves and supports me, and understands… He just can’t remember.

It’s… It’s impossible to fix. That’s the main issue. I just have to deal with it. 

Sorry if this is dour, just kinda something I need to get off my chest. 😅

EDIT: Said, not Sad. Whoops. XD

EDIT 2: God, you guys are all so nice. 🥺🥺🥺 I love you all, thank you. :)"	"He clearly wishes he did though. Thats what counts.
I’m so sorry. My dad has that kind of illness too, and it’s so hard not to be offended when he can’t remember basic things about me. I wish I had more help to offer than just saying I’m sorry and I relate and hold on to knowing that he loves you.
Atleast you know he loves you.
I'm sorry that you are both going through this. My mom is suffering from Alzheimers and doesn't really remember any of us, but is happy enough when i tell her who i am. I will use my dead name for her because it helps her to feel safe. Only for her, though. I will say that one bonus has been getting to come out to her 8 times so far. Her response is very nearly identical each time. I am talking word for word. She loves me and likes to see me so happy, and anybody that doesn't like it...""fuck em!""(along with the sweetest little middle finger ever). If i've had a rough day, i'll walk up the street and come out to mom again. Never fails to make us both smile.
I'm so sorry. 
I came out after my stepfather (basically my dad) passed and I question every day if he would be proud of me.
You are fortunate to have a caring dad.  I can't imagine what it would have been like coming out to my father.
Oh this just makes me so sad.
I take care of my grandmother for part of the week and she has dementia. She can't remember most of the time and frequently calls me my dead name or misgenders me and it guts me every time even though I know it's not her fault and that whenever we have a lucid conversation about it she totally supports me.
It’s rather remarkable that even though his memory is slipping it’s still such an innate part of his nature to try to understand and love you
Hey girl, going through a similar situation here, my dad was diagnosed with alzheimers shortly before I came out and started transition.

It's hard, you're so strong being there for him and it's so amazing that he always supports you even if he does forget.

If you ever have a hard day and don't have anyone to talk to feel free to just send that vent my way, I'll listen.
that fucking sucks. don’t feel guilty for getting annoyed. you are both going through extremely tough times and the point is your dad loves and supports you as best he can. but it must be hard to not resent him/what he says /:
Try to use pins and things around him that reminds you fo your gender? Could help if some other family member does the same so there may not be too many questions of why you have them? He may start remembering your real gender if a person who is cis also helps!
I'm so sorry you're going through this, it's good to know that he still loves you and accepts you regardless, I hope you and the rest of your family get along well.
Not to hijack but some perspective to relate...

Same thing happened with my grandfather. I regret being bitter about it and not being there to spend time with him in his last moments. He wasn't unsupportive, he just couldn't remember. 

I'd urge you to, as much as it's hard, push past it. Losing a loved one when you know you could have been with them more is heartbreaking.
Me and my mum have basically decided it's not even worth trying to tell my dad. He has difficulty understanding even basic things these days and there's a 0% chance he'd even know what's going on. I know my dad would love me no matter what so it feels sad to be hiding it from him but sometimes there isn't much other option. 

(Also I've never heard anyone that's not a Scot say dour so heyy)
My parents have been gone for quite some time, so I can't directly address the trans part. However, I do have some experience with age/health related memory loss. My father and both of my in-laws (like parents to me) suffered from dementia before they died. As painful as it was to have them not remember me or the close relationship we had, being supportive and loving was the way I could give back some of the love they shared with me. Focusing on that really helped me stay positive and helped me be there for the family as we moved through the pain of losing love ones. 

And now I'm crying...
I went through a similar thing with my dad before he passed. It sucks to go through someone being sick like that in general, and this on top of it is not fun. Sorry friend
There is an episode in the nancy podcast where someone else has a similar experience: https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/nancy/episodes/nancy-podcast-asia-kate-dillon

Hope it helps somewhat.

Take care <3
Sorry you're going through this, remember that when he was in full use of his mind he acknowledged who you are and respected it and it didn't matter to him, love was above all. It may be hard for him among all he goes through to again go through that shock every day and maybe he won't react the same way or with the same support each time, but this is why you must remember that when he was at full he did. When the time comes, try to remember him at his best. Love to you and to him 💗.
Do you think it hurts less at least because it's completely out of his control?
I'm sorry you have to go through this. Alzheimers and Dementia took my grandmother almost 6 years ago. I know the pain you feel. Stay strong honey. I'm sending a warm embrace to you. It's okay to let it all out.
Hey at least he's supportive, eh?

Yeah... My dad and my friend's late dad both have/had MS. Watching someone slowly decline into something you (and they) can't recognize anymore is just horrible.

My heart goes out to you ❣️
The Long Goodbye
A poem by Nerdy1980s

The long goodbye, like butterflies 
Memories so new, but fleeting.

Memories, for a moment,
bring great joy, but soon forgotten,
like butterflies in the spring.
If you need new dad I'm here lol.
This is so touching 💖 much love to you and your family
I know the feeling, I came out after my grandmother (raised me from 1 on) passed. I'm 99% sure she would have supported me but can't help but wonder.
similar for me. I'm sure he would've supported me but the lingering question of not knowing is painful and hurts."	tq27zc	trans	878	0.99	2022-03-28 05:33:25
My 5 year old says they’re a girl	"For context, I am a cis woman myself and may accidentally get some things wrong. Please feel free to correct me, and just know that I am still learning. 

My child is five years old, AMAB. They are also on the spectrum, and sometimes have difficulty with pronouns (typically using he/she for the incorrect gender, but will switch them if corrected).

Because of that, my partner thinks they may not understand gender and believes I’m overthinking this for their current age. 

But hear me out - my child has referred to themselves as a girl for as long as they could talk. If you call them a boy, they will correct you and say “No, I’m a girl.” They love video games and will choose a girl avatar every time. A few day ago, they told me they have started using the girl’s bathroom at school (which my partner and I are both supportive of) and have asked their friends to call them a girl. They said it makes them feel sad when some of their classmates say “no, you’re a boy.”

To me, this all sounds like something that has been consistent for the entirety of their life so far. But I have people in my circle (who are cis themselves) who think it’s ridiculous that a five year old would have any concept of gender identity and will potentially grow out of this, and that I should just ignore it for now. I don’t think it’s a phase, but have just been trying to respect my child’s wishes for pronouns, bathrooms, etc. and don’t want to put any pressure on them either way. 

I guess the reason I’m posting this is because I was wondering if anyone here knew they were assigned the wrong gender at a young age, or if any of these things were relatable to you when you were a child. Also, are there any questions I should be asking them? Trying to help this child have as little trauma as possible lol

Edit: First off, I am overwhelmed with gratitude to everyone who decided to comment and share their experiences. One thing I remembered that wasn’t in my original post is how if you ask my child what they want to be when they grow up, their answer is always “a girl.” I do believe they are probably trans, but am going to encourage them to be themselves regardless of gender identity. Love the suggestions for a child therapist, am going to pursue that route as well. Luckily, we live in a very liberal/lgbtq-affirming city and I know that whatever decisions they make about their body will be met with love and support."	"Yes, I knew at a super young age. Not everyone does, but many do.

My personal recommendation is to find them a child therapist to help them work through things and figure out what they want & ensure they understand. You can figure out next actions based on that.
Yes, I had it in a young age but not that strong and my parents are transphobic. Now I am 20 years old and suffer from not being a girl (No Hormones yet etc.)
Autistic trans masc here:

1 out of 6 autistic people are trans. We're more common then most people think. Best thing to do is to just call her a girl. If she stays like this, congratulations, you have a trans daughter. If she doesn't stay like this, congratulations, you have a cis son. Kids should have a safe place to experiment with gender expression and pronouns. It would've changed a lot in my life if my parents had done this.
I have very spotty memory of my earlier childhood but i do remember wanting to be thumbelina and being sad when i was told i couldn't cause she was a girl.  I also remember wanting to skip and being told boys don't do that. Also being really interested in braiding hair. If i was given the freedom to choose then i would've figured it out, but since i was told i couldn't by people i had no reason not to trust i just accepted that.


Children can know their gender at a very young age. If they can understand the concept there is no reason to believe they couldn't know how it applies to themselves. 


I think you're doing the right thing. There is no harm that comes from respecting her wishes now, and if she feels the same way when she begins puberty then she can take measures to avoid the wrong puberty and avoid an enormous load of trauma and a lifetime of pain that comes with that.  I wish my parents had let me have that freedom.
Children as young as two can understand gender, so don't listen to the people saying your child is too young to know! Just listen to your child, support your child in their choice to use whatever pronouns and name and clothes are affirming, and if they are trans they will feel affirmed and figure out it's right for them. You should also find them a child therapist who is experienced in dealing with trans kids in an affirming way.
I just want to say I think it’s amazing that you’ve come online to try and find people with experience and ask questions, that’s an amazing step so many people would never take and I think it shows how much you love your child. 

I think you know your kid better than anyone, if this has been something so consistent, from such a young age, I would trust your instinct and keep listening to what they’re telling you. 

Because I’m 110% sure, they will thank you so so much for it when they’re older! I definitely don’t think it’s a ridiculous idea that someone who’s five can have a grasp of those concepts, I think in many ways they’re innate, I just hope it goes well for you all and I want you to know you’re a great mum!
studies show that children have a concept of their gender identity as young as the age of 3. I’ve also heard (haven’t researched thought) that people on the spectrum often experience gender differently then neurotypical people. You are doing everything right respecting your child’s identity.
At the age of 10, with my first mobile phone, I worked up the courage to call up a sex ed helpline to ask about getting a sex change (terminology of 10yo me). I didn't have the courage to actually finish my question without hanging up but...yeah.
>But I have people in my circle (who are cis themselves) who think it’s ridiculous that a five year old would have any concept of gender identity and will potentially grow out of this

For all we know, she might! But is there any harm in humoring it, if it makes her happy? 

A lot of times people act like transitioning is this huge, completely-life-derailing decision that can never ever be undone, but in truth I don't think you have too much to worry about. Your kid won't be taking any medication or anything until she hits puberty at the earliest, and even if she starts taking hormones, she can always go off them if she decides otherwise. So as for now it's really just a matter of how she wants to present herself to the world in dress and presentation and things like that :)

That said if she's been insisting on this for as long as you can remember, it does sound like a lot of trans kids i've heard of that knew at a young age. But, either way, I just want to reassure you that letting your kid experiment is probably not doing irreparable damage.
I didn't think ""I'm a girl"" at a young age, but I did wish I was a girl a lot. But I think it's such a personal experience, that it may be difficult to judge how your child will develop based on how other people did.
I first knew around that time. And then was closeted for years since my family wasn't quite as cool as you seem.

You're amazing parents btw!
So the whole ‘they’re too young to know’ thing is only ever applied to children who declare as anything other than entirely cis. It’s an invalid argument from the get-go, because if children really were ‘too young to know’ then we would not be treating them as girls or boys based on their body parts to begin with. 

Also, even if your kid was ‘too young’ and they determined later that they actually did want to go by agab pronouns, then … so? Even if this lasted a week, so? (I don’t think it will in this case ftr). Kids exploring gender and figuring out where they fit and who they are is normal. And gender identity evolves as well. Gender can change and our understanding of our gender can (and should) evolve. 

Basically, your kid is sad when someone calls her a boy and happy when someone calls her a girl. So people should call her a girl. If that ever changes, even to the extent of her wanting to be fully identified as a boy, then just do this again and ask people and institutions to use the pronouns they prefer at the time. It’s totally fine to do that more than once. 

Anyway, you are right and your husband is wrong. Also, I’d ask him what’s going on underneath his ‘too young’ argument. It might be that his resistance is less about having a trans child and more about fear of what might happen to his openly trans child in a world  that often doesn’t like trans people, and that’s getting in the way of him understanding the reality of the harm that also comes from kids  being forced to pretend to be someone they aren’t because who they are ‘isn’t ok’.

I’m nonbinary by the way, and have always been aware on some level that I was both boy and girl, although for a lot of my life I did not know that this was a valid and possible identity, only that o wasn’t comfortable being only a girl, but I wasn’t only a boy either. If that makes sense.
At about 4 years old, when I understood that I wasn't going to wake up some morning as a girl. I felt like there was a mistake somewhere. So if I'm not an aberration then yes some of us do have that sense. I was forced into dropping that feeling or else. Thank you for being a concerned parent.
Sociologists generally accept that it’s between the ages of 4 and 6 that we begin to identify and become connected to our social expressions of gender, so no: I don’t think 5 is too young to understand the concept. That being said, I’m not an expert - just a transfemme with a few sociology and anthropology courses under my belt.

As a person who’s on the spectrum and wishes people took me seriously when I was a kid, I’ll just recommend you take their desires to heart and let them express themselves how they see fit. Other people might think it’s not okay, but if you know what makes your kid happy and what makes them miserable, then do what makes them happy.
25 years ahead of me
  
As painful as it might be for them and you, believe me it's better they don't spend the next 25 years as a boy if they aren't.  I did a lot of cool shit in my 20s as a boy NGL but still. 
  
They'll either grow out of it on their own like my tomboy cister did when she reached puberty, or they won't.
If they've been like that they're whole life then it's likely they know they're a girl. Maybe try finding a therapist and then figure out the next actions. I wish I knew from a young age, I'm 19 and now have all the emotional baggage that came along with living falsely. You've got this and its amazing your trying your best as a parent!
The cool thing about being trans at a young age is there's a lot of time before puberty really has a chance to do its thing. As others have said, going to a gender therapist regularly may help sort things out, and allow your child some time to explore who they are, and give you a moment to understand the world you may get more exposed to :)

I want to take a moment to express appreciation for your word choice, especially considering how new you say you are to this. You said ""my child says"" instead of ""my child thinks,"" and used AMAB rather tastefully as well, I think (acknowledged that that was the assignment at birth, which may or may not be correct). Kudos, in my opinion!
Well, I also had suspicions from 5 years old, I remember ask to my mom “how does it feel to be a girl” while she was making se dinner. Anyway I guess you should seek for a child therapist.
As extra sometimes people forget this rule: “if they were able to know that they were boy/girls at 5 years old so do your *son*”
This makes me so happy to read 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 you’re so awesome for reaching out. I knew from a very young age, much before I knew what transgender or transitioning meant. I just knew that I didn’t feel comfortable with the body I had.
If your child is being taught gender roles (which society pushes at that age) then they understand enough to know if it fits them or not. My earliest memories in life are of being confused about why people were pushing me into the gender roles that felt wrong to me. A therapist is definitely a great idea.
Support them unconditionally. Worst case scenario, they grow out of it. Best case, they feel accepted and never have to experience  transphobia from their parents.
I wish I knew when I was that young, before I had any sense of embarrassment or fear or what people would think. Sadly I started to realise much later and at that point I was so nervous to disappoint my parents or worry them in any way I just couldn't do it
At 3 I was forced a ""nice little boy haircut"" by my grandma.  I hated it.  I didn't know why I couldn't have long hair like my mom.  At 4, I was screamed at by my dad for having my nails painted.  I was confused why I couldn't paint my nails, but mom could.  I always HATED being called ""handsome"".  I wanted to be pretty.

I never thought ""I'm a girl"" as a kid, because I didn't understand the difference.  I thought everyone had a penis.  I had no idea I would for certain go through male puberty.  I thought it was random how you developed.  At 9, I said I wished it was possible to change sex.  I thought every boy wished they were girls.

I wasn't great at understanding things, or advocating for myself, or really explaining myself, but I knew on some level I was a girl my whole life.  Once male puberty happened, I died inside.  I couldn't function.  Couldn't date, couldn't hold work, couldn't make lasting friends.  I was miserable until I came out at 33.  When I went for an HRT letter, I was diagnosed with autism.  So much stuff finally made sense.

If I knew as a kid what I know now, I would've been adamant.  But I was born in 86.  Nobody talked about trans kids, or knew what autism was.  I went through life suffering, with no answers and no help.

I wish you luck.  Support them no matter what.
Hey OP, this may ease the doubts your husband may have about it potentially just bwing the autism:
https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/amp

There's a correlation between being on the spectrum and being non-cisgender. In other words, an autistic person is more likely to be trans than a non-autistic person, and vice versa. It's therefor important to be extra observant in these cases and to not discount one for the other
As someone who is on the autism spectrum, a lot of autistic people don't understand the concept of gender which is why a lot of trans and non-binary people are also autistic. We tend to play around with gender more and figure out we're not cis more than neurotypical people.    
     
If your child says they're a girl believe them.
Being autistic makes them more likely to be trans, it's statistically significant comorbidity. I say this as an autistic trans woman.
In kindergarten (around age 4-5) I would always gravitate forwards the boys and things deemed “for the boys”. For example, when asked to divide into lines based on gender, I would always go to the back of the boy’s line before being redirected to the “correct” one. I would claim “the boys are more like me” or “I’m more like a boy inside” when this happened. Luckily, I had great teachers who generally let us do whatever we wanted, so I was usually able to experience kinder in a non-conforming way, which I loved. My tendency to prefer to be grouped with boys and even perceived as one continued all throughout my childhood. When my egg finally cracked, I realised that some part of me had known the truth all along. I recommend finding a trans-friendly therapist for your child and preferably one who can also offer family sessions to you and your husband as well. Also, encourage your child to be their true self. As others have said, the worst that could happen is you let your child be happy and fulfilled during a phase of experimentation. Nobody loses here. You’re doing great.
Get them a child therapist. Kids that age do go through a lot of phases, however assuming this is one will be catastrophic if you're wrong. Take them to a professional who can help them sort out their feelings and decide if they want to go on puberty blockers when they turn ten.

Also, just talk about it with them every step of the way and make sure rhey know they're loved and they're valid no matter what choice they make.
Personally I knew something was ""wrong"" about me, and that I wanted and would be happier as a girl since I was like... 6. So yes it's entirely possible to know at a super young age. I'm 19 now and only accepted the fact I'm trans now, so trust me, starting early can certainly be extremely helpful for someone's happiness and mental health. I'd say that finding a psychologist who specialises in working with children would be a good idea. Either way, even if they grow out of it, being supportive is certainly great and I'm glad you're doing your best to help them discover themselves.
As soon as I knew what gender was, I wanted to be like my sister. I knew that ""boy"" didn't fit. It wasn't until puberty permanently changed my body that I really grasped that my assigned gender was wrong.

I because of how my parents/family reacted to my experimentations with gender, I've only fully accepted myself this very year. I need expensive laser hair treatments, difficult voice feminization therapy, invasive and painful surgeries, and extensive hormone therapy to get me where I want to be.

I don't regret much in life, but I do regret not advocating for myself and getting the treatments earlier. I'm currently grappling with existential dysphoria, and I'm lamenting my lost childhood/teenage years.

I'm not saying dive in headfirst with transitioning, but honor what your kid is telling you. Encourage her, support her, and maybe talk to a doctor or gender specialist about first steps you could take.
I can't really answer your specific questions, but I just wanted to let you know that it is very common for autistic people to be queer in some way. I'm a trans autistic person and I understand the concept of gender, but have decided that it doesn't apply to me. 

Just because your child messes up pronouns verbally doesn't mean they don't understand it internally. Autistic people are often misjudged based on our speech or external behavior and imo your husband shouldn't discount your daughter's understanding purely because of her speech.

I agree with people saying to let her be herself. If she changes her mind later, there is no problem with that, no harm done.
I wonder if your friends would say the same thing about gender to the cis kids. “Ugh my AMAB son Michael thinks he’s a boy. Ridiculous because how can they have any concept of gender?!” Only the trans kids are not capable of conceiving of gender 🤣

This might be a phase or might not, but what are the real consequences of not-ignoring this? In a year they tell you they’re a boy? 😁 seems like there is no consequence at all and that your kid is happy and that I’m jealous she gets you as a parent ♥️
There is a higher percentage of people who are on the Autism Spectrum who are LGBTQ
Just let them be them and be there to support ur son / daughter no matter
what. It does sound like  they maybe either transgender or non-binary.

https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/autism-lgbtq-identity/

Now I am on the autism spectrum  and I am Transgender now I am transitioning later
In life but I wish I had of been able to transition at ur son / daughters age.
There wasn't the support back then I am in my late 40s.

My family doesn't support me being Transgender and don't understand 
Being Transgender.

Just be there and always support your son or daughter
Been saying this their whole life? Your husband is in denial. You need to sort this out with your husband before your kid hits puberty to make sure they can get puberty blockers/anything else they will need.
I can't say I ""knew"" at a young age, just that I kept gravitating to feminine things. I'm also autistic and ADHD, and I grew up in the 80s and 90s in a very conservative community, so I was forced to try and present as neurotypical and masculine. 

As for the people who keep trying to tell you it's a ""phase"", the answer is that allowing your child to present how they want is the fastest way for them to go through it. If it's not a phase, then allowing them to present as their true self will allow them to grow up much happier.
Hello, I am autistic myself.

While it would be possible for a child, especially an autistic child, to misuse pronouns. It does not appear to be the case here, because they are /also/ asking to be allowed to fulfill female roles. Misuse would also be random, not consistent.

It's clear that the child views themself as female.

Transgender identity is very common among autistic individuals, so it is not surprising. Some people attribute it to the different way we view ourselves and society. In any case, these feelings are completely real and valid for the child and should be treated as such.

It sounds like you're doing everything you can to help your child, and that you and your child are both happy. :) Good job!
Likely autistic, and definitely trans person here. I knew from my earliest memories, which was somewhere around 4 years old. I didn’t know I was “transgender”. I knew I wanted desperately to be a girl, and that it wasn’t okay for me to want that because of my parents. Your child is so lucky to be allowed to be themselves.
I wished I was born a girl since I was 4 and it’s never changed or wavered in intensity. People who say kids don’t have a concept of gender are dead wrong.
Everyone else has given valid input so I'll just pop in for a quick comment about:

""Other cis people say i should ignore it and that a 5yo can't possibly understand gender""

But does that matter in this situation though? Using feminine pronouns and doing other traditionally fem things makes your child happy. At the base level, it's really just that simple.

If they do understand gender, good, they already figured out something that can sometimes take an entire lifetime to work through. If they don't understand gender, oh well, worst case scenario this makes them happy for now and they'll be able to figure themselves out in the future, whether they are a girl or not, with no repercussions.

If it doesn't harm anyone, why not make the child happy?
i didn’t think “i’m a girl” at that young of an age, but i did think “im not a boy” so I kinda understand. so my parents thinks me being trans is teen questioning and i couldn’t wish more for someone like you as a parent. It’s difficult and i don’t know how to help you understand this and what to do but just always be utmost accepting of your kid (not saying you aren’t just don’t forget k?) and allow them/her to come to you for anything and be open to change. Again this is just what i would want as a trans child so i hope my rambling is useful in some way sorry i’m out of control and kinda lost and i just needed to fantasize about what kind of parents i wish I had every night when i’m in bed
Hello. To set things first, no one here is a psychologist unless absolutely proven, so we really recommend getting in touch with a pediatrics psychologist with experience and training in early gender dysphoria. The (hopefully good) psychologist will be thorough in helping your child understand their feelings and identity, they will also help confirm your child's identity, not medically, but just making sure that your child IS trans. It's different in children than adults, but valid nonetheless. If and when the time comes, your child will go on puberty blockers to prevent any male puberty from taking place, and when decided by medical professionals, they will go on HRT.

To help your child at home, buy them some girl clothes and other girl stuff you'd think they'd like. Also, talk with your partner, let them know that it is not their decision to choose your childrens gender, and anyone else who pulls that ""they're too young"" crap. Best wishes.
Your child is lucky to know who she is from such a young age. I am 20 and unhappy largely because when I was younger I didn't understand what being trans was and I didn't know who I was.
> I was wondering if anyone here knew they were assigned the wrong gender at a young age  
  
Always. I have *always* known that I am trans. I'm also autistic, by the way. It took me some 26 years to actually transition because whenever I mentioned my female gender, I would receive a ""no you're not"" in response and it made me a miserable child and a miserable adult.  
With that said, don't push anything on your child, but leave the option always open and ensure you inform them of their options as they grow up. The goal is to help them find themselves before they experience puberty, using puberty blockers if they desire to give them more time to decide. Despite sensationalism from the media, puberty blockers are essentially harmless and merely *delay* puberty if the child later decides to commit to their AGAB.  
  
Bless you for coming here for advice, and I wish you and your child all the best! You're doing great so far.
Even if it IS a phase (high it very well could not be) why wouldn’t you invest in it if you can? You won’t ever know if it’s “just a phase” until you’ve missed the beautiful opportunity to be invested in something that will truly shape their life. For some reason it is ok for parents to go with their children on all their other “phases” but not this possible one. Jump in, do the things, buy the clothes, experiment with makeup. Your child will tell you if it’s not them, and you’ll know really quickly if it is.
Thank goodness you live in an lgbt friendly area. I saw the part about a child therapist before reading that part and got scared, thinking a therapist would only try to tell your child to stop. I'm glad to see you so supportive!
I knew before 5. I wish I had a supportive environment. It is really important to listen to them now, it would be better to accept and address this now and throughout childhood than to finally coming up with enough guys to do something about it when 40.
It is messed up to say that someone experience is not valid it doesn't matter the age
I knew it extremely early also and I know a trans man who was exactly like your child. He is still mad that he couldn't start earlier and had to wait till he was 17 to get hormones. I'm extremely mad that I got mine with 21 years, because you know...our life could have been so incredibly much better with far less dysphoria....I actually can't write more right now or else I will spend the rest of the day crying..

I'm so happy to hear that you are supportive, please keep being supportive and for me it sounds like your child is trans. I wish you all the best for the future
Lots of kids know at five. Don't listen to people who don't know what they are talking about.

There is a higher than average rate of autism amongst transgender people. something like 20% in trans people as opposed to 1-3% in general.

Good thing is that you have time to find out, children grow in a very similar way until they hit puberty. You can always get them some girly stuff and some boyish stuff and see whhat they gravitate towards.

School clothes might be a problem if they want to live as their affirmed gender at school so I would suggest gender therapy to get this all figured out sooner rather than later.
I was three and told people I was born a boy but became. A girl, I am afab. Anyways I'm trans queer gender. So... Idk. I think you should allow your child to explore their gender and figure out what they feel is best. They'll know what fits them best.
I second the child therapist route. Maybe it is a phase. Maybe it's not. It certainly doesn't hurt to have someone help your child explore their feelings. I may have turned out completly different had I: A. Been brave enough to even tell my parents about my feelings when I was that age. B. Had someone to help guide me through how I felt about girl vs boy, male or female, or some variety between. Took me 30+ years to break down the conditioning and social pressure that placed me soul searching before cracking my egg.
Even if they does end up ""growing out of it"" that is no reason to not let them identify this way now. People act like gender is such a permanent and important thing. I see no point in it.

Edit: Also I knew there was something different about me before I even knew what gender identity was, but because the fact that ""I was male"" was constantly shoved down my throat, I didn't really realize that I might be trans until very recently in my life.
Yes I knew, was too afraid to tell anyone.
I wish to god I knew I was trans that early in my life. I was to busy dealing with another big life issue during my childhood which was coming to grips with my disability. I’m visually impaired. I don’t think it’s crazy, impossible or wrong to discover that for yourself that early in fact I commend her she sounds like she’s really in tune with her gender identity. If I had known that early things would probably be massively better for me right now and I’d be much better off than I am right now. I’m still young relative to most people but still. You should encourage and empower your child they may be on the spectrum but she really sounds like she knows what she’s talking about. Please feel free to dm me.
I always knew but I never corrected anyone, your daughter has guts, buy her a dress or something
I’ve been saying I wanted to be a boy sine I was 4. I was made to repress that and now I’m 19 and a trans guy. I’m glad you are so supportive of your child. That is going to make a big difference for them growing up.
I definitely knew from the time I was YOUNG. Everyone around me knew and noticed, too. No one supported it, so I hid it for years. But I had been standing to pee from the time I was young, like the boys. I dressed like them, talked like them, did “boyish” activities. It was obvious. You can know young.
There’s a trans woman TikToker Veondre who definitely knew as young as like 6 or 8 and went on blockers when puberty started and is now 17. I think you can definitely know as young as that, and right now you won’t have to think about blockers or other things until she’s a little older. When you do get to that place please listen to her, I know as a trans person younger trans people who went on blockers and got socialized as the gender they identify as are a lot happier. I have a few friends that transitioned early and it makes all the difference.
I think a therapist might be a good idea if you find a good one, but first and foremost I think it's AWESOME that you are so supportive. I'd say let your child be who she is, and if it's a phase, then it's a phase, but the most important thing is to make sure she knows that regardless of what the world says, it's ok to be her (or him, they or whatever she chooses) and that she have your support. All children should have their parents love and support. Noone should have to be afraid to be true to themselves with their parents. You're amazing. All the loves to you and yours <3
At that age, my son, that is on the spectrum too, will say that they was agender, and will inform me in the morning if they was a girl or a boy or neither that day. As a teenager, he said he feels now that he is a guy, but a very androginous one - he enjoys things that society consider feminine, he wear clothing that he consider pretty without any concern about it been masculine or feminine clothing, etc.

Giving him space to experiment in such young age made him comfortable on his own skin, and generally speaking a person that has a sense of self worth and that faced bullying and assholery from peers with a strength that is admirable. 

So, no matter if will be a phase or not. Give them space to experiment, and things will go well.
I knew at age 4, but didn’t start hormones until I was 33. Your child definitely knows the only thing you can do is give them love and support and when they’re old to go onto blockers so they don’t go through puberty then eventually start hormone treatment. I honestly wish I did when I was younger the mental dysphoria gets so much worse as you get older it doesn’t really hit until puberty kicks in it’s just felt wrong.
I knew I was trans when I was 5 or younger. I never verbalised it so clearly because my father and brother are always very critical when I was young which made me play everything close to the chest (whether related to gender or not), not even telling my mom anything I deemed personal despite her being unwaveringly supportive. Then when I got older I realised what telling anyone would mean (child of the 90s when ""that's gay"" was synonymous with ""that's bad""). I definitely knew though. I used to cry at bath time, and ask my mom when my parts would look right. I knew there was something wrong with my body before I ever knew that girls had something else between their legs. I asked when I'd grow boobs and was constantly disappointed to learn I wouldn't. I used to dream every night about waking up in the right body and having everyone just be happy for me. When I got slightly older, maybe 6-7, I used to feel the spot where a vagina should be and look desperately for signs that something was forming there. This despite not knowing what should have been there yet.

I never outwardly expressed it for fear of ridicule, but I definitely knew. If someone had supported me it would have made likely had a happy childhood and well adjusted adulthood vs 30 years of pain, ducking cameras and mirrors, every photo that was taken of me looking like I wanted to commit multiple homicide, not caring about my appearance, throwing myself into dangerous situations hoping someone would end my existence.

You're doing right by your child. By your daughter. Don't let someone who's had no experience with something convince you they're an expert.
I would just do your best to support them. Pronouns, name, clothing, hair, etc is all stuff that if they find out they aren't trans later down the line can be reversed. Even puberty blockers are temporary, but I don't think you have to worry about those right now.
From a transgender woman When i was a child I honestly didn’t play with either especially when you take your vcr apart at 2-4 years old id always prefer to dissect stuff an try an put it bac together lol if i did play with children’s toys it would be both my barbie prefers a 4x4 off-road lol are i would paint my monster trucs blue are pink are a light girlish colors………I always knew i was different from the beginning………it was no phase i tell you……….when i hit 6 I discovered the word transgender from my moms babysitter she was good to share secrets with ………….i regret not transitioning there because thanks to male puberty i look stupid lol an lets be honest male puberty is no where near cute
People are aaaaaaall over this already it seems, so I just want to say you're doing a great job. :) Listening to them and letting them decide for themselves is absolutely the right way to go, ignoring it and forcing them to pretend to be a boy is conversion therapy and causes a lot of damage for a trans person.
I was four when I went around the house pretending my dad’s baggy shirts were dresses, talking/acting as “feminine” as my young brain could process, even saying “I’m a girl” to my parents. This never did go away, though I became more and more scared to express it as time went on. If my parents noticed the way you have, maybe I would be less messed up in the head. This doesn’t mean that the kid is trans, but it’s definitely a possibility
I felt out of place by 10, but there were hints before that.
You should check out r/CisParentTransKid. There’s lots of good advice from lots of parents as well as trans people at various different points along similar roads to yours. I second the advice for a child therapist. Just make sure that your child is comfortable talking to you about things and that they know they can always go to you with anything they every want to discuss even if they don’t feel they have to words yet or don’t think you’ll understand. Show that you’re always willing to try. And make sure that they know that if they don’t like their therapist or don’t feel comfortable for any reason, they don’t need to stay with that therapist for the rest of their life. Sometimes therapists don’t work out because they’re bad, but sometimes personalities just don’t work well together or a therapists techniques that are usually incredibly successful don’t work with how your child learns and thinks. It happens and it’s okay to seek out someone else when that happens.
Strongly trans
Your sense of gender is inherent to your sense of self. The claim that a five year old wouldn’t know or that someone is too young is wrong. I knew really early but wasn’t given the space to experiment, and it hurt me later on. Let her be herself and if she is trans, great, if she isn’t, great. But, most people have an idea of their gender as early as they know who they are in relation to other people. This could be just fun and play, but these experiences are very similar to me and I had the feeling of wanting to be a girl really early on. It is great that she has the confidence and the words to express who she is, wether that be trans or not.
At first I thought 5 is a very early age to know your gender, but then I remembered my past self,and wow. Even from a young age I acted like and liked  girl stuff, the only reason why I realised I am trans much later in life, was because I had no concept of trans people untill a few years back. It is definetely possible that your kid is trans, and you should find a kid therapist that works with lgbtq youth to see what you can do from here
Btw many kids would wish they had a mother like you, keep it up!
I knew at a young age but my family convinced me it was the devil through some very aggressive means... I had always loved singing, and princesses, and wanted to try on my mom's dresses and shoes, but they made me repress all of that. I wasn't able to start feeling normal until my 20s, and it meant having a depressing high school life where I felt disgusted by how I was treated. In PE I would always wait to change, seeing guys changing felt so dirty, and even more importantly, seeing me change was out of the question, they were these big hairy things pushing eachother into lockers, and breaking things, and I was just so overwhelmed by all of that. Regardless of the trauma, it meant I missed a lot. I never went to a dance or event, or met with people outside a small friend group. You seem far more supportive and willing to accept their choices, but the point being, let them make them, let them explore, help them to discover who they want to be, then you can both say that neither of you missed out on the beautiful experience you both have to share. They are going to need you, and the love of a child who feels seen and heard can be a magnificent thing.
Even if it were to just be a phase, where’s the harm in referring to them as a girl for now? If they, a few years down the line, come to the conclusion that they aren’t a girl afterall there won’t be much harm done. Imo, and I’m not a parent so I might be totally wrong on this, it would make no sense not to support your child in how they identify. It seems like there would be way more damage done if you don’t support them, no matter how you look at it.
I've been going through something similar with my 6 year old. I've put in the time and effort to research extensively and have found that most paediatricians recommend allowing your child to express themselves. They are still learning the concept of gender and they might grow out of it, they might not. But allowed them to explore who they are now is much better for their health both now and in the future. If you want someone to talk to about this, feel free to message me. I can also drop some links to sources if you're interested in the articles but I'm on mobile rn so I'll have to do it when I'm on my pc.
Children tend to understand the concept of gender at a young age. They’re exposed to it very young (blue is for boys, pink is for girls. Trucks are for boys, dolls are for girls) so they do understand gender, and if she’s saying that she’s a girl, I would believe her. Even if she changes her mind some day, then that’s okay. I don’t think there’s any harm in letting children socially transition, if you think that it will improve their life. Also, this can prevent them from going through years on internalized transphobia, and taking years to feel comfortable in their skin. Plus, they can go on puberty blockers in their teens, and start estrogen/testosterone, and have a fairly normal puberty, instead of having to go through extra steps. (This is all optional though, and depends on your state) I would mainly just focus on letting her socially transition, and see if she continues to feel this way throughout her entire childhood.
i knew since i was 5 because that’s when i started having gender being enforced on me at school which gave me a clear understanding of gender and where i fit in pretty young and i transitioned socially at age 7 and have been very happy living as a trans masculine person at the age of 18 now :) transitioning young helped me find myself as a person instead of having to constantly stress over being called and treated like someone i’m not. i cut my hair and moved schools and dressed like a boy and was mostly accepted as one and defended by my peers. i strongly urge you to watch videos on trans people and consider starting them on hormone blockers before puberty, id say 11 and then on female hormones by 14 would give them a smooth transition without having to experience the pain of physical and often irreversible in trans girls dysphoria caused by male puberty and postponing it until they’re sure won’t hurt them if monitored by a doctor :) i would’ve been so much happier if i had been on hormone blockers and wouldn’t need top surgery now, and their face will go masculinization they’d be very unhappy with if you don’t step in and really talk it through with them in maybe a couple years when they’ve explored a bit more?
I mean I subconsciously knew since I was 7 but was forced to repress it until I finally decided to confront these feelings a year or two ago
You're in the right here, and thank you for listening to your child.

The idea that kids can be ""too young"" to understand their own gender is just a collective guess from cis people who frankly have probably never intentionally interacted with a trans person ever.

The science does not back that idea at all, and shows we can be certain of our present and future trans identity at least at six, often at four, some even earlier. Even before speech, kids are sometimes observed distressed about their body's sexual characteristics, who then later transition.

As long as you keep listening, you will do okay. It's better for their health and wellbeing to have supporting parents than anxious gatekeepers.
People who claim that kids don't know what they want are people who don't respect kids. Kids aren't dumb, they know what they want and they know what they like. If she's saying she's a girl then that's what she is. And you know what? If she changes her mind, that's ok too. If that happens could be she's actually non binary. Respect what she feels and don't tell her how she feels is wrong.
I’m so glad you’re so supportive! You’re awesome.
I am a trans woman. 

I knew at 3 but was not met with support. I spent my entire childhood looking at the girls at school wishing I could be like them. 

Told my parents at 14 that I was a girl and wanted to transition and they put me in therapy with a conversion therapist who claimed to be trans friendly. I backed out of the decision after that and it took me another 10 painful years to finally accept myself. I absolutely agree with the advice to find a therapist, just make sure to vet them. 

I can assure you your child knows their feelings on this and they are genuine. Not saying they can't change with time and develop but they are likely not going away and not a phase. 

You are an amazing parent and I am so proud of you for supporting your child. The world needs parents like you 💜
Honestly you seem like a very caring and supportive mother I wish my mother was like that. I'd recommend sending them to a child therapist or a gender therapist who specializes in trans children.
this post may have been settled but I want to say my piece. Please note I'm a bit forgetful and I may get information wrong and mean no harm, please correct me if I seem wrong or kind of rude.

I personally think the child is correct in her beliefs. Around her age I also believed I was meant to be a girl, as I would flick my hair a lot like you'd see in media, and sometimes lick my lips a lot to pretend it was lipstick. My hair was always shoulder length, and quite thick, so I just naturally felt feminine, despite that everyone still seen me as a boy. The thing is, I never expressed to anyone how I felt feminine, at least nothing obvious, and nor did I verbally express it. I too always have played as a woman when I could make a character in games, as part of my identity, but I am always acceptive playing as a man in a game if there isn't a choice, gender has never ""concrete strong"" on my beliefs. 

At the age of 11, I was diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) like your daughter seems to have been, except for the age I was diagnosed at, but I believe I am high functioning, I don't know if your daughter is too, but if she is she may truly grasp an understanding just as good as anyone else in LGBTQ when she is older. If your SO believes autism hinders her understanding, he should try to find more information and contact professionals, if he didn't already, about this situation, you should get involved too.

My feelings towards being a girl got weaker as I grew older, but they never fully gone away. I genuinely have always felt like I'd become a woman within a heartbeat if I ever got the chance. The reason my feelings got weaker is simply because I tried to become more acceptive of being an AMAB over time. I'm glad I gave into more of a feminine identity though. 

Although I wholeheartedly think you should encourage your child, just make sure she's healthy and safe in her transition!
I remember on the first day of pre-school having to wear a frilly shirt (I'm AFAB) and crying and saying that I hated how I looked. My mother had always let me wear boy clothes before I had to go to school and it was awful when I was forced to wear feminine things. If your child is showing even more blatant signs, I wouldn't be surprised if they really were trans.
Right now, it doesn't matter if it's a phase or not.

Right now, your child says they're a girl, they want to be a girl, so they are a girl.

Things might or might not change as they grow up, maybe it stays the same and they live their life as a girl, maybe they find a more specific label under the NB umbrella, as I said, it doesn't matter

You do what makes your child happy right now, five years old isn't too young for cis kids to know they're cis, so it shouldn't be too early for trans kids to know their gender either. Your kid has all the time in the world to figure themselves out and explore, but right now, I'd say they're pretty sure they're your daughter :D
Id say to let ur kiddo express themself however they like, just remind them that they’re not tied down to a single gender and can always end up being something else (not always the case but it’s good for them to know)
Keep I mind even if it is just a phase your child still deserves to be respected! If they change their mind later on, so be it! Just let them know you'll always support them!! <3
Five is not too young to be that aware in my opinion. My egg cracked only recently, at around 28, but thinking back I realise that even as a child I wished that I was a boy with a tremendous intensity. I rejected femininity for a long time, then I went through a phase of hyperfemininity around 26 and now I'm back to my old goblinous ways. 

Five is not too young to identify oneself. If anything, I'd say that your girl is very mature about herself.
i just want to remind you that if they decide they're not trans at this age, then there are absolutely no consequences. you can take them for a haircut the same day, you can get them new clothes, you can switch to using he/him and a masculine name and it will all be over. 

exploring their gender by letting them be whatever they want to be will only teach them that their parents listen to them and support them. you're making the right choice by giving them the support to be themself, whoever they may turn out to be.
When I told my mother I was trans, she recounted a story from when I was three years old and called it her ""first clue"". For additional context, I am AMAB and have ADHD, a similar variance in executive function to some types of autism.

While not everyone does, some us for sure know we are our gender at litterally as young of an age as we are capable of expressing ourselves. Others not so much, others didn't realize they were trans until they were much older, and capable of fully unpacking the idea consciously, 

&#x200B;

For sure just support who they are. Some kids do have sudden shifts in their gender identification between like, 5 and 10. If they say they are a girl, call them a girl. But don't PUSH them to be a girl. They are still figuring out their gender at such a young age, and their relationship to it might suddenly change as they approach puberty. 

Also yeah, a therapist is a good idea. Being (possibly?) trans is confusing, it needs talking out.
If 5 year olds don't understand gender, then why do they know words like boy, girl, man, woman, mommy, daddy?
I absolutely knew by four, and only wish I had supportive parents like you. It was 20 years later that I was able to start transitioning.
I would recommend you to support them and just see how it goes.
Your child is more than meets the eye.
apparently gender dysphoria and stuff like that is common with people on the spectrum
I definitely knew how I felt around 3 or 4 (preschool age).  I also understood that it wasn’t acceptable where I grew up.  It seems great to me that you’re a parent who is willing to listen and better yet that your kid trusts you enough to share all of themselves.  I never had that growing up and it definitely hurt me a lot, especially by my teen years.

(32yo trans woman)
when i was 5 i remember i wanted to wear skirts and such. even dreamed and daydreamed about it. your kid probably known who they are by now. good news is that you dont need to medically intervene until like idk 12 or so years old minimum? so for now all you gotta do is but her correct clothes and use right name/pronouns etc
I knew since I was 2 trust me listening to your kid now can save them a lot of anguish down the road
Therapist is the right way to go

But I also want to add that to your friends who are saying this is ridiculous and they can't know their gender identity at 5

Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of not assigning one to children. Gender is in everything
You can't raise them without impacting their gender identity. As far as I am concerned it is far better as a parent to validate them in something they might change their mind about later than it is to dismiss this now. 

If you teach them that you will value their perception of their gender identity now they are gonna have no issue telling you of that changes. If you unwittingly teach them that you don't by dismissing it and telling them to wait until they are older then they might feel like they can't tall to you about it even when they are older. 

So you're doing the right thing
I knew when I was very young. I am not sure quite how long I knew but I am certain that I knew by the age of 6, because at 6 I met another trans kid who also knew they were trans, and managed to fall in love even at such a young age. We are also both autistic. I am sure I must have known when I was a bit younger than that as well. We ended up getting married last year.

As for what you should do with your kid. 

I think every kid should be taught about trans people, because trans people are people who exist and deserve understanding. If that happened, then trans kids would as a side effect of this, learn what the name and context is for what they’re feeling, and thus have the ability to ask for help. They would also learn that their parents are positive and supportive of trans people, and thus that it’s safe to ask.

A lot of children end up feeling like it’s not safe to talk to their parents about being trans, even if their parents have not expressed any hostility towards trans people. I don’t know for sure as it would be hard to study but I think it might have to do with the fact that they view the parents as the primary source of the incorrect and hurtful gender role being forced on them, and therefore see the parents as unsafe to ask for help from. I’m not saying this is necessarily the case, but it’s something to be aware of because it’s pretty common. So talking positively about trans people can really help with that.

If you create the right environment your child can develop their sense of gender without pressure in any direction, and feel safe to come to you and ask for help if needed.
Ok well at that age, absolutely no medical stuff will happen. So just do the things that make them happy now and if that changes, it changes. But it will make it easier for them to discover themselves if people do what makes them comfortable now.
I came out at the age of four for the first time and my parents just rolled with it. They asked everyone in family and kindergarden to use my preferred pronouns and it went good. I even got into school as a boy (I'm a transman) officially. But due to bullying in school I got in the closet again and my parents thought the whole thing was just a phase and that it would be alright. Due to trauma i even convinced myself over time that it was just a phase. I'm currently working on pulling myself out of the closet and my misery again. 
I would recommend a therapist, so your child can talk about their experiences and get the help they need and in the case that they get bullied or something, they have someone to help them through that so they won't  feel the need to give up their reality.
The fact that your 5 year old has a concept of gender should clearly show to your sceptic cis persons that gender has nothing to do with a concept that first has to be learned.
Everybody has a gender, regardless if they are educated about that or not.

I'm happy that you are so supportive to your girl. Great Mum! ❤️
I knew i was male from my earliest memories (around age 5)
I new pretty young that I wanted to try girl things and always wondered/thought it would be cool/better to be a girl. That was all suppressed by religious beliefs from fam and school. I'm 22 now and just starting to transition and looking back can't help but feel without those influences my life woukd be alot better now and I could've been better educated and transitioned YEARS ago. 

It is honestly just so great that you are supportive of your child and open to things and willing to help. As for stuff to do like many said a gender therapist woukd be great. Also just directly asking your kid about how they feel, ask if they know difference between boys and girls and what they liked to be called etc
I'm pretty sure the only reason i didn't know at age 6 was because of my transphobic dad constantly forcing toxic masculinity onto me. I loved wearing pink skirts, and I always wanted to have long hair.

I figured it out at 13 instead, when I made a tumblr account and found out that trans ppl existed and was like ""so you mean I *can* be a girl?""
Yes you are doing everything right by respecting their pronouns and wanting to use the bathroom. Obviously children that age won’t know what being trans is so a lot of the time it’s confusing and we aren’t sure why we feel the way we do but I can say that from around 5 I would be happy anytime I was included in with the boys/told I looked like my dad and that I used to try to pee standing up (I’m a trans man ftm for context) so yes it’s completely normal and valid for your child to know how she’s feeling and if anything she’s being really brave for correcting people when she feels uncomfortable because that takes a lot of courage even when you’re well into your 20’s.
Some children know they're not their agab as soon as they can make the slightest difference between boys and girls, and I think your child's lucky to have you as their mother. You might want to reach for a LGBTQ-friendly therapist. 
In the meantime, keep affirming your child's identity, if they say they're a girl, they might probably be one. Especially if they refer to themselves as a girl for as long as they can talk.
I'm not a parent myself, but I see absolutely nothing wrong about social transitioning at the young age. Even if she ""grows out of it"", literally nothing has been done and she can just continue living as male.

The ""talk"" about it ig I would do somewhere around the start of puberty, since if she's trans, she's gonna want puberty blockers and later HRT because holy hell puberty is already super hard, but us trans kids had to go through a wrong one. I'm glad your child knows about trans people and feels free enough to express herself, I didn't even know about the concept, and simple knowledge would've saved me hours of agony spent on the floor wondering what's wrong with me until I found out about I could be trans.

Just love your child, let them express herself however she wants, it's absolutely harmless at this young age
Yes, I knew. I wasn’t adamant about sharing it, though I wish I had been. Society wasn’t as accepting in the 80’s. Instead I buried it where it festered and almost killed me.

Mad love to you fir being such a powerful advocate for your child!
I knew I was a girl from as far as I can remember, just never thought it was possible, realistic, or even had terminology for it until a few years back now.
I knew something wasn't right at a young age but didn't know how to explain it. Now I'm almost 22 trying to figure things out lmao. Its a struggle but I'm sure your kid will do great with your help
I’m FTM for context. I didn’t know until I was 15. But I often played as a boy in video games when I was very young. I would say once I came out the best support for me was my father just accepting it and asking if there was nothing I needed. I went to a children’s hospital where they have a gender identity program. And they are lovely and helped with everything so much. I suggest them because they can lead you to good a gender therapist as well as if you ever want to take the next steps.
Gender is more fluid than people often acknowledge, and while it is entirely possible that your child will “grow out of it” you should support them as they are, and if they “grow out of it” it has to be on their terms. Gender is already established by that age and from what you are describing I’m pretty sure they would get the clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
A child therapist is a great idea. Thanks!
I second this. 5 is such a young age and a crazy time for development. 5 year olds are only starting to have a basic understanding of complex emotions and feelings. They go through phases constantly. (I have a 7y/o so I speak from experience). That's not to say your kid isn't valid in how they identify but having a professional who can help them through these feelings is really your best bet. And for the love of god, talk to your kid every step of the way, be supportive and make sure they know that no matter who they are, they are loved (which it sounds like you're already doing so good job there!)
Do you have a source for the claim that 1 in 6 autistic folks are trans? I know a lot of us are trans, but I've never seen anyone claim the rate was that high
This is the best advice. I was thinking the same.
Any research into this and you pretty much just find that cis people don't question or desire to be the other gender, which falls into the DSM-5 designation for gender dysphoria as well. Here is more about that https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria
Make absolutely certain that they're a trans friendly therapist. This is more important than I think some would realize.
Just be careful to check for a therapist that works with lgbtq people, that is open minded.
> doesn't stay like this, congratulations, you have a cis son. Kids should have a safe place to experiment with

I see it all over the place, but I haven't seen any sources. 

Actually... there was a big meta study result people were linking to, on [https://www.spectrumnews.org/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/) I think but I can't find it in 5 secs of searching.
I too would be interested. That seems very high.
A seminar at the Radboud hospital/university about Autism Spectrum Disorder that I went to 2 years ago.
I believe it’s because autistic people are generally more internal so are thinking about stuff a lot more, like being trans.
Yes, absolutely...
It says 6 times higher. Not one in six, but that's still /huge/.

[https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/)

I will caution anyone reading, that the empathy score measures ""neurotypical expression of empathy"". Empathy is autistic people may be similar or higher than neurotypicals depending on the individual.

boy moding at work = sad girl vibez		"Was confused for a sec cuz I thought you were transmasc. Sorry you can't be out yet but you look cute in boy mode
if it makes you feel any better, i thought you were a butch lesbian.
imo, you look like a woman, even so. maybe androgynous leaning irl depending on voice, height, body language, etc. hope you're able to get to a point where you don't need to boymode soon!
Where did you get a blackberry in this day and age???
this is the best thing I can say, as it's a compliment I was giving when ""boy moding"" (I don't often cause of how uncomfy it can be) but you look so much like a masculine girl, like a tomboy or (sorry to stereotype) butch lesbain. I don't see any boy here, I see a girl who likes boys clothing!!!
I literally thought you were transmasc. Don’t let the haters get you down!
Going through the same :( But like others said, I think you definitely have a butch-like style, and I genuinely think you're cute!
I feel you sister, stay strong
i also fw the blackberry
""Boymode""
I get it. I do the same thing. Not because I have to. But because in order to actually look like a girl it requires a few hours of prep work. And I just don't have that kinda time before work.
Honestly thought transmasc because the boymode presentation but to me your face looks very AFAB. When you’re ready to be out out you’ll smash it girl! Those cheekbonesssss I see you!
God damn. I feel this today. 
Looking handsome tho! Stay safe 💕
Would have said butch lesbian. Had to buffer over like... transmasc? Wait? No.... 

You got this!
Nice Key2!
Girlie you look great but explain the blackberry phone please I’m dying of curiosity
 femme vibes shining through
You look like one of my lesbian friends ☺️☺️☺️ pretty
(Tom)boy modeing
If this helps, i totally thought you were butch/tomboy/a masc presenting cis woman before reading the caption. You’re very pretty! I hope you will be able to be out at work at some point, if that’s your goal
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thanks! I feel like being on E is making me look more lesbian/pre T transmasc when I boymode which makes me laugh but I still don't love pretending im a guy
Haha.. More tomboy les but it does make me feel better!
Thank you!! I hate that I'm not out at work and have to present as a guy but I definitely push the envelope into andro more and more... last week I even had my nails painted! My body language is pretty fem, my voice is andro and I'm 5'6"". I feel like I read as a pre T trans guy lol which is ironic kinda.. Oh well, one day I won't have to pretend anymore
I was coming in to say just this.
From what I found this is probably a blackberry key 2. They launched that phone in 2018. Unfortunately they don't build phones anymore.
I've had it for a few yrs now. It's the Key 2 LE.. I've loved BlackBerry for years.. Will be sad when it dies
That's so sweet, thank you!
Aw shucks.. Thanks 💜.. Sorry to hear you're going through the same
Thanks 💜
BlackBerry gang stand up
The transfem struggle is real
This made me smile really big! Thank you ☺️
Thats just it.. I don't want to be handsome lol
Some lady came up to me and told me to give my life to God and thought I was Transmasc . Fuck it girl just do it for the memes until you feel okay coming out. Lots of us are in this boat, I'm just under a year and a half and still rocking it in boymode which weirds people out because they all know I'm trans but not dressing Fem. (Self hatred for me at this point ).
I had to come to the comments to see your explanation because I was confused too. Pretty sure you are hitting male fail status 😂
Same thing basically
Wow, I thought I’d never see a BlackBerry in the wild again.
Hey I'm just under a year and a half too! I rock boy mode because of severe social anxiety and my brain telling me I look ridiculous when I present fem... *sigh*
Oh god I hope I'm getting close to male failing status.. Dysphoria tells me I'm not even close haha
I know theyre inferior phones but I love them ☺️
     It's one heck of a hurdle if not the biggest. We really don't learn how to pass until we learn how we fail. In the meantime until that day (me included) should work on introspection without overthinking.         
      Social situations make me doubt myself but when I get home, take my clothes off , look in the mirror, I feel grounded for the first time in my life and that's our truth. We are doing this for ourselves not other people and at the end of the day it's not like most of us can go back to shore so we keep paddling.
     The whole point of being trans in a sense is to break away from that ideology. Literally breaking away from what everyone wants us to be just to become what that they want us to be again just seems like a wast of time mentally. It's like guitar playing in a way,  most success it seems is from playing in public. We have no real sense in the world until we put it all out there and on the line. We play a song/riff and most of the time it's better than we perceive it as while playing it."	xa1x7h	trans	825	0.99	2022-09-09 17:51:19

How are you?
The ""not being able to see all comments"" part might be due to going on this post over your notifications. I would assume it's a bug that nothing happens when taping on ""view all"" in the top right corner under the post.
Hi sad and lonely! I'm [[name not available yet]]
Hi friend! Don’t you worry sometimes I get sad and lonely. I have a cis partner and three children from her. And I get lonely from time to time. I think maybe it’s from not having an actual connection with another trans girl. But you know that’s just me but it’s not always like this. I wish you the best and keep your head up and your heart open you just never know.
Hey friend, I hope that you'll have a nice day and will soon find folks to not be alone with. 
If you ever want to chat, my DMs welcome you. :)

I've just discovered that my sibling is a closeted trans girl, and I don't know how to help her	"Hi Reddit, I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'm kind of overwhelmed rn and I want your advice-

I (16, cis F) found my sibling's (16, AMAB) diary lying open two weeks ago and I couldn't resist looking through it, so I did. The first entry was from June 2021, around 9mo ago. They wrote about how they'd wanted to be a girl since they were a kid, and how happy they felt when they got called she/her. She wrote about how bad she felt about seeing her face becoming increasingly angular and her jawline becoming square, about how her shoulders were getting wider and how she could do nothing to stop herself from looking like a monster. She apparently started voice training in the summer but stopped in January after feeling like she hadn't made much progress. She wrote about how distressed she was when her facial hair started coming in earlier this year, and how she was scared that she'd get rejected by us and get called a freak if she came out, and being an embarrassment to the family and messing up her life. In her more recent entries, she wrote about repressing and reading TERF viewpoints to make herself forget about being trans, but she also wrote about how her greatest fear was that those feelings would re-emerge 20 years from now, and she'd be in a far worse place to do anything than she would be now.

There were maybe a couple of ""signs"" when she was really young. We studied at the same school for 3 years before my parents sent her to a boys' school, and during that 3 year period, all of her friends were girls. When we were like 7 she told me she had a dream where she was a girl and she was sad that it wasn't real. She's always been shy and nerdy, and I think she got bullied quite a bit when she first switched to the boys' school, but it's gotten a lot better now and she has her own group of friends.

she caught me looking at her screen when she was browsing a trans-related subreddit last week and she looked really upset afterwards. At this point she probably knows that I know something's up, but as far as I know, she hasn't opened up to anyone about it yet. Our parents are rather Christian, and we live in Hong Kong, a big city that's seemingly progressive but still holds very conservative attitudes towards LGBT people. I did some googling and found that the minimum age for starting HRT is 18, and there's an RLE requirement before that, so I don't think there's a lot that she can do for now. The effects of puberty kicked in relatively late for her and she's only the same height as I am (5'7""), and I don't think she looks half as bad as she thinks she does, but I'm worried about what it'll mean for her and her mental health in the next couple of years if there's nothing that can be done.

I feel bad about having gone through her diary, but I think she needs someone to talk to, and I don't know how to bring this up with her.

\----------

TL;DR: I've just discovered that my sister is trans, she's too scared to come out, and I don't know how to help her."	"Just being there to listen, or be a shoulder to cry on is enough. Tell her that you know, and make it clear that you A: are very supportive 
And B: won't tell anyone unless she's comfortable with you doing so
id defenetly talk to her, and tell her you support her, she needs it rn. im really glad youre supporting her. maybe getting her some dresses from an online shop and tellign your parents its for you would be a great gift.
First and most important dont out her to anyone, that will ruin your relationship forever. 

Second, consider telling her you know she will be mad but if you explain you still love her and support her she might forgive you. Or you could start hinting you know and calling gendering her as a girl when talking to her occasionally. Like saying “Your a funny sister.” Or something
On the repressing entries: Make sure she knows that the whole ""what if these feelings re-emerge in 20 years"" isn't an if, it's a when. Assure her that although things will be tough right now, that she may have to keep presenting as male for a while until she can get into a better situation (which may be out of the country, or it could be remaining in there and going through their channels), repressing these feelings entirely isn't the right way to go, and falling into hateful ideologies is harmful to her health and eventually, since if she came to agree with those things she'd contribute to those attitudes, harmful to the health of many others.
I can’t say for certain how she might be feeling, but personally I would’ve loved to have that first step of familial support when growing up. Idk how you found her diary, but you said it was lying open, maybe she intended for you to read it
Sounds like she left her diary out on purpose, it could be a cry for help. I would talk to her about it
If you don’t think it’s a safe environment for her to come out and she isn’t ready yet, try and be coy about it. It might be really fun for the both of you if you make bets like “hey, if you can’t do X, you’ll let me have to do makeup on you and dress you in Y for the whole day.” Something seemingly innocent that she will be dying with joy over on the inside thinking she’s the luckiest girl and getting away without others knowing. You could always tell her, and help support her in telling your parents/friends. It’s a scary thing, even with family you know will be supportive. Every time you come out to a new person it feels like Russian Roulette with your social life. Be kind and patient, she will be more appreciative than you ever know.
Talk to her, possibly bring up different LGBT topics first, expressing your support for the community, possibly mentioning a friend or colleague that is part of LGBT. “Hey, have you seen the news? It’s horrible what Greg Abbot has done down in Texas, don’t you think?” Then you can let her come out to you.
Once she comes out, support her however you can. When possible, maybe refer to her by her preferred name and pronouns while in situations she feels comfortable in. Invite her to do feminine things together with you, if you enjoy that. You seem like a very caring sibling, asking for help being supportive is amazing and heartwarming to see. I’m sure you’ll do great helping her.
I can’t speak for everyone (obviously) but if I was in the closet and my sister just kinda went “I’m really sorry but I saw your diary, but I love and support you” I would be so conflicted, but so happy at the same time. I’d say to tell her that you know, offer to teach her things, or just kinda aggressively gender her (as in using gendered terms more often that normal, such as calling her “sis” or something more often). 

I honestly kinda prefer it when I don’t have to say a word about coming out. Like some online friends and people I know from high school know I’m trans but I never had to say anything, cause one of my friends did it for me. For some people you definitely have to come out yourself, but to just have people you never said anything to start using the correct name and pronouns is really nice, cause you don’t have to worry about it.

One thing that I would like to say is that feelings like this will re-emerge, this isn’t exactly a thing you can bottle up, at least not without a lot of stress. Cis people don’t have to bottle up feelings like this cause they normally don’t have them in the first place.
If I was your sister- 

1) I would adore you, you sound like a great sibling.

2) I would be mortified if my secret was point-blank sprung on me.

Subtlety here is the key.

I bet your sis might know the trans pride flag colours. You rep the colour combo on something obvious to her but nobody else; she might take the bait.

Not- breaching the topic. But, getting next to it. And letting her proceed (or not) at a pace she finds comfortable.
please update us! 

make it known you're supportitive and you'll have her back, and don't out her to anybody (optional, if necessary: tell her to stay away from terfs (they're nazi adjacent at best))
I didn't read the post once I realized you were sharing personal private thoughts from someones diary. That's fucked up. From the comments it seems like your heart is in the right place. This does not excuse the complete lack of respect for boundaries and privacy. I'd be pissed if I were your sibling.
>but she also wrote about how her greatest fear was that those feelings would re-emerge 20 years from now, and she'd be in a far worse place to do anything than she would be now.


ooooh 😔 that hit hard
If your parents are ever gone, it might be nice to propose doing your sibling's make-up or dressing up
Hi there! I am glad you were the one to find out first. Are your parents transphobic? Either way, talk to her and tell her you are happy to have her as a sister and you will always be supportive of her. I am sure she will be very happy to be heard and seen 💖😍🥰
Be there for her.  One of the best feelings in the world is to go from being terrified by how vulnerable you have to allow yourself to be to share that sort of thing, only to have it ***not*** explode in your face.
Hey! im also a child of HK christian parents! As you know in HK is rather more a social contruct along with christianity, and I can see why your sister is fearing about it. 

Make sure to tell her that she is loved by you and know that she is supported and you're there for her. Us trans needs support and love most when it comes to puberty and such, and she needs that from you, even for good times. Don't tell your parents about this, or friends or extended family, she can do that if she wants to come out.
Trick is let them do their own thing if you wear similar sized clothes maybe give them some stuff to try on and see how they feel but don't force them ask if they want to learn makeup be understanding but don't shout it out they will appreciate it but coming out is a slow slow process
Oh shoot that diary sounds like a lot of my own thoughts... Just show that you're a supportive sister and be there for her. I hope she will be okay it's a lot to realize and watch your body change for the worse... Maybe if you know how and she's interested you could show her things like how to use makeup or hair things or clothing if any of that is interesting.
Tell her that you know and that you support her, being trans is really hard and dysphoria destroys your mind (ftm here, came out as trans to friends for the first time 2 years ago). In my case having cis people's support wasn't enough tho, so I found a telegram grup (I'm an admin of it now) and everything got just better for me. I felt that I would drown in myself, only the darkest thoughts came to my mind. Joining a group helped sooo much, I was so scared to introduce myself as a he/him and there was so much stuff I didn't know (I was fighting my transphobe thoughts bc of the long denial too).
🤔
i will say that as a trans girl, having an afab ally (be they cis or in my case, a trans guy) can be a massive confidence life and one tends to take advice on ""how to girl"" from them

as other have said, find a good time, tell her and make absolutely sure that she knows youre supportive and wont tell anyone but us internet strangers

the fact that youre here asking is nearly proof that youll be a good ally, though in the future r/asktransgender might be a better thread
First off, you should probably apologize to her for reading her diary without permission and then tell her that you love her no matter what. I'd do this in a note in her room and let her come to you. If she is dealing with as much internalized transphobia as she might be then it'd be a good idea to buy a trans ally pin and wear it when around her. If the pin isn't viable because you fear for your own wellbeing then I advise against it.  


Also, try asking your parents what they think about the LGBTQ community, specifically trans people, to see if they even hold conservative values on them.
OP, she might feel like she can't possibly be accepted as herself, might initially reject your offer of support no matter how well presented and genuine. 

But you still need to talk to her, because a small sibling betrayal of trust accidentally unearthed her deepest secret, and you now have the power to destroy her life.

My advice would be first of all find a time when you are both alone and won't be disturbed. Ideally she should have a place to retreat to alone, so inviting her to your room rather than going to hers for this.

As for what to say or how to approach it... My head says start with a declaration of love for your sibling leading quickly into an apology for betraying her trust, and then listening to what she wants. My heart says just throw your arms around her in a big hug while crying and saying you love her and that you're sorry.

Ultimately though, it is her life and her choice what she does or doesn't do. Standing to one side whatching her get misgendered and hurt by family, teachers, friends... and doing nothing, might be what she asks of you. 
Also I've assumed your sibling's gender here based on what you said, but they may contradict that. 

Thank you so much for asking rather than just confronting her blindly. It sounds like a difficult situation, particularly living under a regime that is repressive against LGBTQ+ individuals and organisations. 

{offers hugs with no expectation}
talk to her about it and maybe treat her like a sister but also make sure u talk to ur sister about it bc she might not want that
this, even through a note left in her room or something. explain youre sorry for intruding and that you fully support them in any way she would want and im 99,999999% sure she will absolutely love you for that.
I think that's what I would do. Just start calling her sis and girl. So casual like it's nothing.
As a therapist and a 32 year newly out trans woman I agree with this so much.
How do you stop repressing?
Do people do this? If a family member had read my diary that would be lights out for our relationship
I’ve left Easter eggs for my family and friends to find, in hope that my subtle hints would get them to break the ice, since I was too scared to do it.  And it worked.
So I completely get where you’re coming from here - as for the specific example you gave, I could see that being a really nice thing she would appreciate. However, I could also see it sort of backfiring, depending on what both of the people are like / how the situation would go. It’s possible that it would just seem to OP’s sister that the activity is being framed as a punishment / deserving of ridicule (like “you’ll have to let me do [x], which is a punishment because it’s shameful / people would laugh at you for it”), and it might end up making her even more afraid to come out.

Again, I have no idea how something like that might go for them and it’s totally possible it would work as you envisioned - I just wanted to bring up this other possibility as something to consider.
I half-second this comment.  
Obviously the ""I'm sorry I saw but I love you"" part is good, but the ""not have a choice"" thing is...it's better to ask if she wants you to help with that or if it's on your sister to commit to it.
I don't know if my parents are transphobic, but I'm struggling to find ways to test the waters because LGBT issues don't come up in the news at all in Hong Kong, and randomly bringing them up would be, well, weird. I haven't heard them say anything transphobic or homophobic, but they're Christians, so I really don't know.
Could maybe make her uncomfortable as well as she is not out and would likely be panicked without explanation maybe just talk to her
Definitely don’t do this. Be clear with her about your support. Saying you know someone closeted is trans and leaving it at that is a recipe for an instant anxiety spike.
Yea
If someone would go into my room and look through my private stuff while I'm not there, I'd be extremely pissed, too! But if I had a diary no one should see, I definitely wouldn't let it lie around openly. Not even in my own room when I'm not in there. The way OP found it sounds like her sister might actually have had the intention to give her a hint with that, I think...
What are some hints that I could look out for to see if she's ready to come out?
That’s fair, though at this point, if she’s in this stage of socially transitioning, the amount of euphoria would likely be so great as to overshadow any negatives. Not that this is true for everyone, mind you, but before my egg cracked I would have killed for such an opportunity, and I know for many others they experienced something akin to this.
I see. Maybe telling them you have a friend who is LGBT or something like that? Do you play any online games? Maybe it could be an ""online friend""
I think it depends on the person. But maybe it might be a bit much off the bat. I just think it reduces the anxiety of having to come out about it if you hint that you know and are cool with it.
Yeah that’s fair actually, I guess it also depends on individual’s relationships
u should probably talk to her first and tell her u know so u dont accidently out ur sister"	taawso	trans	811	0.99	2022-03-09 15:59:49
Who Is Your Trans Icon!?	There are sadly a few popular trans pop stars. There should be more. Sadly the ones who are popular are problematic. My trans icon is SOPHIE. RIP Queen.	"[removed]
I know this maybe a little off base, but hear me out: 

Sam Collins
Is it too egotistical to claim myself as my trans icon? 

Not putting down anyone else, I've just never seen someone who is trans in a way I can completely relate, and I'm really proud of the progress I've made.
Lena Raine!! she's one of my favorite musicians and was a huge inspiration for me as I was coming out :)
Hunter Schafer
One would be Elliot Page. I liked him before coming out and when he came out I was very proud. He already inspired me, and now even more.

Someone else that inspires me a lot is Jamie Raines(youtuber). He helped me learn a lot of stuff(lgbtq+) and has been very helpful navigating my gender and sexuality.
laura les
The Wachowskis
I would say Samantha Lux, she is so smart and 100% goals!
eddie redmayne /s

but actually Maddy Thorson and Lena Raine (the creator and the composer of celeste, respectively)

edit for spelling
Laura Jane Grace or Elliot Page
Not a pop star, but definitely an iconic trans woman: Nikkie de Jager (aka NikkieTutorials). Primarily a YouTuber, but she's presented the Eurovision Song Contest, and has 2 shows on Dutch TV too.
Well my trans icon is not famous but a person I used to know that is pushing through all of the things that are pushing her down
Abigail Thorn of Philosophy Tube. Her coming out video helped me crack my own egg.
Jammidodger on YouTube. The man is so sweet, funny, and inspiring, and he really knows what he's talking about. And honestly, he's transition goals for me!
Jazz Jennings
Easy. Meowriza.
Hunter Schafer
Laura Jane Grace, ND Stevenson, and Eliot Page.
SOPHIE was a goddess, she's my trans music icon
Hunter Scafer, I just finished watching euphoria and her storyline really helped me come to terms with my identity and be more confident in it than ever. Not to mention they are an actual trans person playing the role of a trans person which we don't see often enough imo
Abigail Thorn
Does myself count?
While I disagree with her on a handful of important points— Natalie Wynn.
Ian Alexander and Jessie Gender. I maaaay be a slight Trekkie.

Oh! And Jamie Clayton. LOVED her in Sense8.
Does Blahaj count?
noah fince ! hes a youtuber and now music maker that i found from searching “how to dress masc” and stuffs about top surgury
Wendy Carlos!
Dominique Jackson and Marsha P Johnson <3 Both Black Trans woman pioneers who are the foundation of the entire community. These women need to be given their flowers<3
Me motherfucker 😈
lou sullivan, elliot page, sylvia rivera, domanique jackson, and the wachowskis :)
Sarah McBride, Laura Jane Grace, Abigail Thorn, and Natalie Wynn.
summer luk, and blahaj
Lena Raine 100% she’s so cute and I love her work. Mad jealousy but after everything she’s done she deserves the name she’s made for herself!
I dont know if it counts but, a friend of mine, She was the first Trans person i ever talked to and helped me figuring stuff out
Bunny/rabbit from steam powered giraffe.
Lou Sullivan - the gay trans man who got heterosexuality removed from transition requirements.
Also Chelsea manning bc I mean holy shit how could one not admire her
Laura Jane Grace and Kate Bornstein, Kate's the author of the book Hello Cruel World, they have an interesting view on gender and life.
Idk how to pick just one😭 Laverne Cox, Mj Rodriguez, Dominique Jackson, Indya Moore, Sam Collins, Hunter Schaefer, Ashley Adamson. I love all of them💖🤣
James Stephanie Sterling
Chelsea Manning definitely. Girl exposed US military war crimes AND is now dating Grimes
Kim Petras. ☺️
No one's mentioned her yet, but Jessie Earl/Jessie gender on youtube. One of the smartest YouTubers I've seen.
I love the Sophie song Its Okay to Cry. I have been listening to a lot of Laura Jane Grace, Against Me.

If I was to choose a trans icon who truly inspires me, it would be Jammidodger on YouTube. I think he is a god representation of the best of the trans community. I do wish I could find a trans woman creator who had the same friendly energy.
Patti Harrison or Jamie Clayton or Laura Jane grace, or bailey jay
Ben Barres, neuroscience professor. Talk to him with broken english via email almost 10 years ago and he's super chill guy.

Thank you for teaching me about transition and synesthesia
I really like Jamie Clayton from Sense 8
i am my own icon
Backxwash she's such a queen
Jamie Raines 🥰🥰🥰

Seriously hearing “Hey spuds!” Warms my heart when I’m sad

Other than that I’d say Chelsea manning, 
absolute madwoman, total respect from me.

As well as maddy thorson and lena raine.
My boyfriend ❤️
Summer Luk, Jammidodger, and Kim Petras to name a few
Laura Jane Grace from Against Me!

Though i guess she isn't a pop star, she makes punk rock music.
Natalie Wynn because she's highly entertaining and has produced some very poignant content. She's also total goals for transition.

Mia Mulder because I like her attitude as a person and can relate quite a lot to her interests. Her podcast is great too and her sense of humour really comes through in that more compared to her youtube videos. Also total transition goals.

Abigail Thorn because her coming out video really resonated with me and helped crack my egg.

To a lesser degree as well: Mia Violet because her book (Yes, you are trans enough) helped me a lot with impostor syndrome.
Sophie is my icon too!! I started my transition because of her! I also love Arca
Hunter Schafer
Mia Violet. Her book You are Trans Enough really helped me on my journey.
My best friend!
Abigail Thorn. And also lead singer from A.S.S.P. He's cis but he gave me a lot of strength, since he performs every concert in a dress. Also F1nnster.
Does Rain from [the webcomic](https://rain.thecomicseries.com/comics/first/) count?
Personally, Lena Raine is my icon
Myself
Sewerlvt

God damn her music hits different
Elliot page and laverne cox, and idk if it counts but my favourite author Ivan Coyote is my personal trans icon. I wouldn’t be out as trans without them :)
[deleted]
Abigail thorn
Anna Varney Cantodea from Sopor Aeternus. She goes about it rather uniquely & defies norms in a way that inspires me.
Mine isn’t a pop star but veondre on tiktok
Elliot Page and a classmate of mine
Natalie Wynn
I don't know if this counts but TheLexiKitty is my favorite trans woman and the reason why I decided it was okay to come out as trans. If you don't know her she's on YouTube, and I think twitch but don't quote me on that.
Nicole maines
April Daniels
Not artists, but Hunter Scafer, Nyla Rose, and Abigail Thorn
Miles mcckena and SOPHIE, they were both super important to me back when I was kind of coming out to myself in 2017-2019
ruby rose, gender is shrug 🤷
Laura Jane Grace (the singer of Against Me!), Dark Sheik (indie pro-wrestler), and Abigal Thorn (who runs the youtube channel Philosophytube) are the first that come to mind
Myself
Naomi from Sense8
FUCKING SNAPCUBE

LOVE U PENNY!!!
Me

i’m just that goddamn good
I don't have one
Well it’s egotistical to nominate myself but definitely going to have to say I’m proud of myself for the progress I made in my small country town in 2016-2018 where, by coming out and raising awareness to trans ness in the community I really paved the way for a lot more kids to come out as trans and inadvertently put the supports in place for a lot of LGBT youth. I’ve had so many people come out in the years since to tell me how my own transition really helped crack their egg or make things easier for them and it’s a really surreal feeling. 

Aside from myself and the particular niche i filled in some rural backwoods aussie town years ago… probably you tubers like Ty Turner and Jammidodger for helping me in 2016 when I was first getting a footing in trans spaces. 

As well as Abigail Thorn and Natalie Wynn, two very smart trans girls that know much more than this himbo ever could 😅😅
One trans creator I've been following for the last little while is Bloody on Twitch. I'm also a big fan of Jammiedodger and Jessie Gender on YouTube.
nikkie tutorials!!
my brother
Nat Puff aka Left at London or /@/
Salvia. Her art is what inspired me to come out.
The authors of multiple blogs and news articles about Dr. Rumer, who - from personal experience - is the most dangerous medical provider for transgender patients I've ever had the displeasure of meeting.
Chelsea Manning
J0K3RTR3Y
Not super popular but Connie Sgarbossa from SeeYouSpaceCowboy. I am really into the hardcore/alt/metal music scene and it's really nice to have someone who's like me fronting a band I like a lot.
I dont have one sadly
GoMotion and LeadHead are both youtubers I love. Mia Moore is a goddess in her own right
Angelica Ross
Marsha Johnson, all my homies love a revolutionary qween
Genesis P-Orridge though they’d hate the term trans
hunter schafer
Blahaj...
\- Elliot Page. As a cinema student and aspiring movie maker, seeing another trans man in the cinema field is really, REALLY inspiring.

\- Wendy Carlos. She created the soundtracks of my favorite movie (Clockwork Orange), but also Tron and Shining. She revolutionized electronic music.

\- Lou Sullivan. At a time where transphobia was rising, he assumed himself as a gay trans man until the end. Max Wolf Valerio told about him ""Lou was a writer and capable of standing up for what he saw as truth. He was a gay transsexual man, before this was even allowed or recognized. He is also the person who helped to change that, and now – being gay is no longer an issue if you want to begin transition"" (obviously, there are still shitty doctors who refuse to make trans people transition when they're gay, but being straight isn't an official criteria anymore because of him). He died of complications after his surgery (certainly HIV), and he said ***""I took a certain pleasure in informing the gender clinic that even though their program told me I could not live as a gay man, it looks like I'm going to die like one""***, which is one of the most powerful quote I have ever heard.
Jammidodger the youtuber
hunter schafer
lauren bousfield and devi mccallion!!
Madeline from Celeste. While its probably a lot sillier than other people's choice, the fact that Madeline is trans along with the game's message about anxiety and other issues is pretty good. She was the first character i identified with.

My trans icon is Patti Harrison. She's so funny on I Think You Should Leave.  Accepting myself as trans always felt so daunting and scary but seeing her be so funny made me think I could do it. Watching her blow up in movies and more shows, but also having her act exactly the same is somehow deepening my acceptance of myself.  I think you should leave came out right before the pandemic and if it hadn't I really think I'd still be a cis boy depressed.
Mine has to be Lena Raine. Celeste helped me accept myself so much!
Sam Collins, Mj Rodriguez, Laverne Cox, Indiya Moore -all good choices as for favorites
Not a pop star but still great: Chipflake
Me🤭
its a youtuber- their yt name is natigska-
definitely Hunter Schafer
I would say jay page mainly bc he’s a musician and makes the kind of music i literally love but i also love his personality and we share a name ;) but honestly i can’t decide who’s my fav icon so i have a few like noah finnce laverne cox eliot page jammie dodger etc theres just so many cool trans ppl
Viv from Paper Mario Thousand Year Door
Morgana Ignis, she is an actress and also is the voice actor of Sallie May in Helluva Boss
I like Elliot Page and the YouTuber Kade Cooks, he does reviews and stuff to help other trans people, like men's bathroom etiquette and reviewing trans products.
Oh, and Noah Finnce. He's great too!
Dean Spade (non-entertainment industry) & Patti Harrison (entertainment industry).
Lena Raine or Laura Les, both really cool gals that have great work out.
Penny Parker(Snapcube)
Mine is Cavetown (Robbie)
Wendy Carlos. god bless her.
Eliot page!
Laura Jane Grace from Against Me was my first big introduction to a trans artist I really loved. I binged several clips from her series, True Trans, which is kinda skeevy looking back, because B*ck Ang*l was heavily featured in an episode, and just absolutely FUCK that guy! But Laura has since denounced and distanced herself from him, back in 2020 I think, which is great.
As for YouTubers: Sarah Zedig, not to be confused with Sarah Z, used to be a regular watch for me until she quit doing YouTube.
Penny ""SnapCube"" Parker is a fucking legend. Gameplay Streams/videos, Real Time Fandubs, and music, she is a full threat of talent. 💖 (All of her friends and her gf Joy are all just as funny as she is, so getting into her content is like a massive package deal of so many talented and amazing people who also make content. Except for the case of 2 specific ones, who took literally everybody by surprised with how awful they truly were)
Sorry that this is a really long reply. Lol
Not “pop” by a long shot, but Devi McCallion and Ada Rook of Black Dresses, which is my favourite band, not to mention they both make their own amazing solo music (Devi under like 38462820 different psuedonyms), Ada has made some video games that look awesome and I’m dying to try, and Devi has written and read out some trans woman centred smut, I can link to it if anyone wants it, it’s pretty good.
I am.
Me, myself , and I
The singer Jackie Shane. Also Amanda Lepore, Coccinelle, Crystal Labeija, Sylvester, and so many more
 Yves tumor, they really have an incredible style and music that draws from such classic punk/rock culture yet is completely new I really admire them
I've never had idols lol
Great rising comedy star Patty Harrison, she’s great on ‘I think you should leave’ and is the first trans person to be a Disney voice in raya and the dragon 


Not a pop star but then pop is not my genre
Contra
Abigail Thorne.
Josef Stalin.
Wendy Carlos and then Lynn Conway gave me the hope and strength to transition a little over 20 years ago. Lynn called me at work to congratulate and offer words of support. Turns out we have very different values, so her being an ally was never reality. Today the only women who treat me with respect are Cisgender. I wish it was different but I gave up hope of having trans allies or friends.
Julian Morris, artist name is Layperson. There's a short documentary on YouTube about him very good
samuel spano, he really inspired me to work on my own story
Anna-Varney Cantodea
Gomotion and Atsuover, absolute epic people:)
Laura Jane Grace. I was always a fan of Against Me! but her coming out was what really got me thinking about my own feelings around gender. Against Me!'s album Transgender Dysphoria Blues put so many feelings I had ignored into words. I still listen to that album all the time but the first time I heard it, it reduced me to tears.
Kim Petras. For both her music and her activism.
i have a cis man thats a trans icon 💀(Will wood)

But for actual trans people/people that fall under the trans umbrella: TimeClova (their very cool B)) and Eret
Laura Jane Grace!!! <3 she's the frontwoman of against me
The gorgeous Contrapoints 🥺🥺. She is so articulate and represents queer femininity in such a nuanced way that I have to Stan. Also Kim Petras because she is such an amazing singer and just iconic too.
Natalie Wynn a.k.a contrapoints

Teddy Quinlivan, Valentina Sampaio, and Emma Ellingsen
Noah finnce, ya'll probs havnt heard of him, but he's a trans singer/songwriter/youtuber, and hes great. he also just relesed a new song, after therapy, ya'll should listen to that
My trans icon is Lucy, they're pretty cool
Laura Jane Grace 10000%
Isabella Bunny Bennett from spg

And Lena raine
Josie Totah. Saw her on jesse. Really helps me get through this.
miles mckenna
idk if id called her my icon but i just really like her music and stuff her name is madidextrous
They might not be great people, but I love that Gigi Gorgeous and Nats Getty are out there being rich and living their best lives as a trans couple
Atsuover probably she's awsome
sonic the hedgehog.  


think about it, boy hedgehogs have chest hair and furry arms, but sonic doesn't.  
COINCIDENCE!?  
I THINK SO!
Eliot page and sam collins
TBH a girl in my class, when she told us I didn't even believe it at first, there ways absolutely nothing of a ""clue"" to be found.

Indya moore I think or abigail thorn
For a long time it was Janet Mock
Christine Jorgensen, for sure.
awfultune
Loving how much Laura Jane Grace has come up, her music helped me out a ton in my early trans days. Another Laura I've looked up to for a long time is Laura Kate Dale (Laurakbuzz), who's written some amazing books, makes great disability content on youtube and stars in a lot of podcaats I like. She's also helped organise several of the more high profile trans rights protests in the uk lately!
Isabella ""Bunny"" Bennett of Steam Powered Giraffe

She even did a cute trans pride music video once. Love her!!
Not quite a trans icon, but there was a mention of one dude from history who was pretty flamboyantly gay who I thought was cool, he was mentioned in the Queer Villians episode of Overly Sarcastic Productions
Noah finnece (youtuber) a FTM content and music creator
Laura Jane Grace
🤔 Natalie Mars 
Melody Fluffington
SOPHIE. She was a huge part of my coming out & realisation of my trans identity. Also her music is amazing. True pioneer & icon taken from us in the most tragic, meaningless way. Forever in our hearts & minds 💕
Isabella ""Rabbit"" Bennett. Her singing is fire and she's just generally a very cool person!
Tone Sekelius
Probably SOPHIE too and Laura Les
Elliot Page for sure. I grew up loving Juno and seeing him grow into being his true self has been amazing. Our stories kinda parallel, he first came out as queer and was in a wlw queer relationship, same with me. And then came out as a trans man, same with me.
 
I've always felt such a connection to him, and I just realized more and more why that is. Seeing him so happy gives me hope on the days where I feel like shit due to dysphoria.
Robbin Skinner (Cavetown) goin to a concert april 5th :))
Jesse James Keitel & Miles Mckenna (Jesse is a non-binary actress who played a non-binary character in Big Sky & miles is a youtuber)

Laura Les
Tone Sekelius. She was the first Trans participant in Melodifestivalen, the Swedish Eurovision selection contest. 

She finished 4th in her first heat, and went on to the semi finals, where she won it, ahead of Melfest regulars Alvaro Esterra and Anna Bergendahl.

In the grand final, she finished 5th, recieving 31 points from the international juries, and 53 points from the televoting. 

Her song, My Way, is such a pride anthem, and I would recommend to give it a listen.
Nb child here. I'm very child. My icons aren't real people lmao. Like menhera and blahaj.
Freya Holmer! Huge inspiration for me since I'm into gamedev myself and honestly even if she wasn't trans she has some great content for any programming and maths enthusiasts
Luminum, a TFT/League of Legends youtuber/streamer
Layla Eden (Awfultune), Robbie Skinner (Cavetown), and Noahfinnce. Layla specifically is really inspirational to me cuz I have really bad voice dysphoria and seeing her just putting herself out there is really encouraging!
Shea Diamond, she's a singer
Ryan Cassata
Hey there!

Hunter Schafer, aka Jewels from Euphoria!
OMG. She is such a great actor and I have a thing for her.

Another, although she's not Trans, is Lady Gaga!   Born This Way

Personally not trans, but Laura Jane Grace is one of the most bad ass musicians ever and certainly one of my idols
Holly ""Hollowtones!"" She's a twitch streamer and is very funny!! She's influenced my sense of humor a lot.
Jamie (the youtuber) and lena raine

I love those two so much and they are just huge inspirations for me
Tacticool GF is big gender yes
My girlfriend!! 😍🥰
Abigail Thorn!
Laverne Cox
SOPHIE, Arca and Laura Les definitely. I produce music so my objective if i do suceed into a PC Music level is to continue what SOPHIE started.
Sophie is mine as well! She was so badass and made some incredible music!
Sophie! I probably wouldn’t have survived without her music.

Laura Jane Grace. Listening to her before I understood what it meant to be transgender was kind of life-changing, and her book too.

Honorable mention to Elliot Page for publicly coming out the very moment that I started questioning.
Jammidodger aka Jamie raines and not trans but non-binary Demi Lovato and Elliot page because we have the same name also YouTuber Samantha lux
Jammie Dodger and Sam Collins
Janet Mock, Emma Ellingsen, and Hunter Schafer!
Isabella Bennet.  She's a trans gal in my favorite steampunk band and if it weren't for her I don't think I would have fully understood what being trans actually was.
NOAHFINNCE
Julia Serano, Chase Strangio
While this is a fictional character, my icon would be Arashi Narukami!
Laura Jane Grace from Against Me!
Jamie Raines (the YouTuber Jammidodger)

Elliot Page (Actor)
Schuyler Bailar
I love Sarah McBride! I read her book before my egg cracked and not only did it help me crack but it was so inspiring! I’m so proud of her and hope she goes far!

Jamie Clayton is another icon I love! I also love Natalie Wynn’s and Samantha Lux’s videos!
 Ryan Cassata! He’s a musician and has some really heartwarming songs about being trans, but I don’t see enough people talking about him
Jen Richards. She was an influence and positive presence in the early days of my transition. Her episode of Tales from the City is amazing. She is a writer too, and her web series Her Story is beautiful and honest.
Zoey Proasheck!
The plus size queen of chocolate I actually got a picture with her

JUNO BIRCH
Is Nicole Maines a good answer?
I loved her as Dreamer in DC's Supergirl.
But I dont know too much about her outside of that and I haven't looked just in case.
But the fact that the power she has always passes to females of the family, I love that the character she plays is also a trans woman. And the power recognises her as a woman.

Stacy Cay. I've met her at her live shows, she's cool af
SOPHIE or Hunter Schafer!
This is a hard question but I’ll narrow it down to three - I’ve seen him mentioned a bit but Lou Sullivan and Ben Power Alwin are two of mine. They’re both incredible trans men that worked to archive trans and queer lives. 

Ben is still living and in charge of the Sexual Minority Archive in MA and it’s an archive stored in his home. 

My other icon is my chosen father/mentor Perry Zurn. He’s the head of our undergraduate philosophy department, and is in charge of the trans archive exhibit we have on campus.
My trans icon isn’t famous but his name is Simon and he’s so fucking amazing
Elliot Page or myself 😜
Kim Petras and Carmen Carrera
Alice Gas.
probably cavetown :)
my boyfriend
Reade Wolcott, Ezra Furman, LJG, Ryan Cassata, awfultune, take your pick.
Is that the Sophie down in San Antonio? She's awesome, I've met her in person a few times and my bf has worked several campaigns with her.
Patti Harrison - comedian whose comedy actually matches mine.

Fran Blanche - YouTuber, nice to see I’m not the only trans engineering type weirdo out there!

The Wachowskis - maybe unpopular opinion but I liked the fourth matrix movie because it feels even more Trans experience focused.
Noah Finnce i think
Wendy carlos. : 3
Elliot page.
Sallie May ofc
Samantha Lux!
Lena Raine.
Laura Jane Grace. I loved Against Me! Before her transition. Seen her live before her transition back around 06. I've read her book. I get to see her play her solo stuff as well as Anthony Green in May as my birthday present from my wifey. I'm so excited I can barely stand it.
Boone Williams and Kat Blaque, their channels helped me through a lot.
Murphy on tik tok
Robbin Skinner- 
Cavetown
Me because I don't really have one ahah but unconceited enough, I really haven't thought about that guess I don't think about it I think that the journey enough for all of us is enough to make us all icons ☺️

She is not really that popular i think but msbreezy is a huge inspiration for me

My icon may not be someone famous, but there is a trans women in my towns local wrestling group who is going for the women’s title! She gives me hope that on day I can be as confident as her 🙂!
Jazz Jennings maybe
Dorian Electra
Lia Thompson or our king, Elliott Page
Theyre more youtubers but Jammie Dodge and Sam Collins. They're my faves 🥰
There's a popular twitch streamer called Umbra who passed so well I didn't know she was trans until she mentioned it on a stream like... A year into me following. I already loved her content, that just made me excited for the future of myself - maybe I can be pretty like her!
You are my trans icon along with every other person in this sub 💜
Either Hunter Schafer or Laura Jane Grace, both are icons
I saw the notification and instantly thought SOPHIE
My crush

He is also trans
Daisy Taylor
Jamie Raines
Hunter Schafer
Laura Jane Grace!!
she's from this band called against me! and she's awesome
Kim petras😍
i dont have one.

i dont need an icon, i need a friend to help shape me, and she is the best at encouraging me.

i even think im making real progress on my voice because of her :)
Miles McKenna 😎
LONGLIVE TOYA DA BODY MS.GOODBAR,AND SIDNEY STAR
Miles McKenna, I've watched him for 3 years now and still he helped me
If I had to pick, it would be Lilith Lovett
Jamie (from jamiedogder) or cavetown
Laura Jane Grace lead singer of Against Me!
Magi, Super Smash Bros Melee player. First female to get top 8 at a supermajor and first trans player to get top 8 at a supermajor
Sophie passed as soon as i found her and as soon as i found myself. I'm certain if she was still here making art my whole crisis would be alot easier...
Winona Powers because she is absolutely awesome. 💕
Brian Michael Smith :)
Edit: lmao wait I’m sorry I didn’t fully read the post and thought you were just talking about celebs or something my b.
Abagail Thorn
u/deleted tbh

tgcj users lmao
Ms Breezy
Isabella Bunny Bennett from Steam Powered Giraffe!!! ❤️
Elliot Page for sure
Charlie Martin
gottmik 100%💕
Jamie Clayton is fucking amazing, as is Sense8
elliot fletcher is mine he was the first trans person I had saw and really was interested in even when I thought I was cis
Kate Bornstein is her own type of icon
Lena Raine
Samantha lux and Sam collins
Morgana Ignis. She's such a slayer omg.
I really like elyottos and noahfinnces music/videos
Victor Lockhart. Hes also a cosplayer and victorian goth and continues to inspire me time and time again
Sophie who my I ask?
SOPHIE is still one of my favorite artists. Her song ""Like We Never Said Goodbye"" reminds me of meeting my husband.
My gf is pretty cool, let’s go w her
Ms Breezy (Bree), I know it’s an odd choice but she kinda showed me it was possible to be yourself. I didn’t even know about transitioning and though I would always be trapped and disingenuous to myself before finding her.
Has to be Chelsea Manning for me honestly
Nicole Maines. First live action trans superhero.
Lena Raine and Amy Schneider, Lena because who doesn't love pigstep and her music is just amazing all-round, and Amy because I watched her become the 2nd place Jeopardy world champion not too long ago.
not a real person but ranma 1/2...
Atsuover. So creative and made me so passionate about art! She is open about her struggles and is super relatable. Also she is HILARIOUS.

Other than that Sam Collins and Jami Dodger.
Eliot Page for sure!!!!
Trace Lysette and Amiyah Scott!
ryan cassata and jazz jennings were the first trans people i ever learned about, so i can credit them to discovering myself
Charlie Martin
Jammidodger and Summer Luk
Maddy Thorson and Lena Raine! They're the developer and music composer for the game Celeste.
It's gotta be Isabella Bunny Bennet of steam powered giraffe
Jasmine Kennedie 💖
Too many. SOPHIE, Amanda Lepore, Glamorous Monique, Leiomy Maldonado, Trace Lysette, Candis Cayne, Isis King, Dominique Jackson (tbh everyone from Pose) and also Wendy Carlos for practically inventing electronic music as we know it today!

And all of the girlies from Paris Is Burning, and the Party Monster documentary as those were both huge to me.
Eliot page
Oryx the taken king
100% Laverne cox. Huge inspiration for me. Mtf actress making it into a tv show (orange is the new black) that is set in a female prison made me feel more accepted in ""womanhood"". Her story in thr show was a big inspiration for me
Venues Van Dam on sons of anarchy
Laverne Cox. Was mesmerized by her in Orange is the New Black and have only fallen further in love since. She’s so confident and brave and proud and inspirational.

Also she’s got a very sweet and warm demeanor which I don’t see celebrated enough. It’s the kind of person I am / try to be and I’m still used to living as a man and having it being treated… derisively by men.
It’s the woman from euphoria. Just because she is the first that really spoke about it when the show came out (from my own opinion)
Natalie mars
Lena Raine and Maddy Thorson!
Calpernia Addams. I read her autobiography and felt inspired to look inward at myself.
Cristina La Veneno, and Laura Jane grace. And myself b/c we gotta be our own hero too 🙃
Honestly.. I know that everyone says popular trans people, but I don't find myself relating to them..

Honestly.. My trans icon is a friend of mine! Seeing how she goes on day to day, and doesnt let anything stop her amazes me. She is a strong woman and I would hope to be just like her one day.
I don't have one, I wish I did. There aren't very many people that relate to me to such a strong degree physically and mentally. Maybe there's someone out there, but I guess I don't know of many people can the transitioning that are dealing with the mental stuff I have to at the same time.
Dorian Electra is my non-binary trans icon for just fucking with every stereotype and deep subculture possible. Laura Les is also amazing. And as a trans guy myself Elliot Page is pretty cool.
Kerri Colby
Contrapoints and myself 😎. Hahaha jk about myself but I am proud of my confidence and think I am really good at dismantling transphobes' takes
Summer luk
Me. 😎
Jamie Raines (Jammidodger) and Kade Gottlieb (Gottmik)
Valentina Sampaio. She’s honestly one of the reasons why my egg cracked. She is definitely an inspiration to me.
Thelexikitty definitely her coming out guide also really helped me coming out to my parents as bi/pan and enby
This girl named Nova who graduated last year at my school. Unknowingly made a huge impression on me
yeahOk! Her music is absolutely angelic
They're not really famous, but I love MsBreezy on YouTube. It's a bit sad that the video about how My Little Pony affected her trans identity got taken down (but someone archived it).
ARCA ⚧⚧⚧⚧⚧⚧⚧⚧⚧⚧⚧
Amy Schneider! I love jeopardy, and she’s my favorite super-champion of all time :D
Samantha Lux I guess
Probably Lena Raine
Umbra on twitch.tv!!!! Check her out please! She's so sweet and awesome and was a huge inspiration when I first came out as trans, I love her so much
Indya Moore for sure.
elliot page
Nicole Maines
Not pop but Mena Caputo of LOA.
She hasn't been in a lot of films, but Jamie Clayton definitely has a special place in my heart. Her role in Sense8 I think made me aware of trans people and queer issues when mainstream media had shied away from it, and she always stuck out to me even before I began questioning. Damn good show, too haha
Aiden Miller and Mars Wright 

Not celebrities but they are tiktokers that I've seen in comps :3 and I absolutely love them
My girlfriend. She's the first person I've truly been able to come into myself around!
Kim Petras is fun. Also the trans dinos in Jurrasic park. Absolute icons. ;) AND in the 90’s!
Jammidodger <33333
How is it we've missed Alok Vaid-Manon and Auntie Kate Bornstien. Also although she's already been mentioned shout out to Laura Jane Grace for helping me find my voice again and proving that voice training isn't necessary.
Hunter Schafer, ARCA, Sophie, Laverne Cox, Eskay, Sam Collins, Sasha Allen, just to name a few
Carmen carrera or Kim Petras 😍
People who are trans and don't put !? On the end of everything
Lou Sullivan, Amos Mac and Miles McKenna, also anyone who is trans masc and gay
Chase Ross is a pretty chill dude, he does a bunch of reviews for packers and stuff that are really helpful. plus, he has the most infectious excitement I've ever seen lmao
Abigail Thorn.
Jamie Clayton
Isabella Bennett and Martine Rothblatt
Noah Finnce all the way, not really a pop star, but hes a music artist. Helped me come to terms with my identity and makes amazing music!
oh. uh. uhh. scp 049. is he fictional? yes. very much so. but a cosplay goes a long way for absolutely shattering eggs
Laura Jane Grace
Julia Kaye. She's a cartoonist that writes Up an Out comics and she wrote a book called Super Late Bloomer about transitioning. So idetitoed with a lot of what she was saying
Don't know if it's been said, but Luke Hudson?
Music-wise, Laura Jane Grace from Against Me! for sure, but my greatest inspiration in both transness and politics would have to be Sophie From Mars, her advocacy, activism, media analysis, streams, interviews, and general awesomeness is overwhelmingly awesome. Honorable mentions to Laura K Dale/ Buzz, James Stephanie Stirling, Mia Mulder, Jessie Earl/ Gender, and No Comment Chick.
Laura Jane Grace!!!!
Alsoashleyb on insta
AJ Clementine on Tiktok, she helped me so much on my journey
Annie Dro! twitch.tv/annie
she's so cute and making waves for us girls in esports we love seeing her succeed!
Luke Wale, Sam Collins, and Noah Finnce
The one's whos names we don't know yet.  


I don't idolize anyone.
My boyfriend, Marsha P. Johnson, and Sammy Copley. All of them have helped me through some shit, I doubt I'd be alive if I never knew any of them.
Lena Raine
Ive got a few... Sam collins, 
 noahfinnce, jammidodger, and the one i look up to most finntheinfinncible
hunter schafer and stormryan :)
As a musician, probably either Lena Raine or Laura Jane Grace.

Lena is a video game composer who has some of the most expressive and emotion filled tracks I've ever listened to, with her music greatly enhancing the experience in both Celeste and Minecraft.

Laura is the lead singer of Against Me!, and her music slaps. She's got a similar voice to me, and her lyrics speak greatly to the trans experience.

These two gave me hope when I felt that I wouldn't be able to get far with my musical career, and Im starting to see some big names in the music industry be trans, and thats just so lovely.
Has anyone said Alana McLaughlin yet?
Laura Jane Grace, holy shit I love her and her band
Samantha Lux all the way for me, literally an inspiration to me and helped me come out
Lena Raine
Chanel santini
Marsha P. Johnson.
Lena Raine
So I may be showing my age, but from the very beginning of my transitional journey I idolize Erica Andrews. Her beauty and smile was always something to inspire me. After she passed I watched so many of her performances again and again. Her memory will always live on.
Are there any Vegan+Trans politicians?
I don't have one. Although I liked Page in Umbrella Academy so maybe him? Going off the board with Sylveon, and, possibly me if my imaginary art career takes off lol
I heard of Eliot I think!
Never heard of them! Are they artist or……
I wanted to say that too! Also Jammi Dodger
He’s so cool!
Yes
I got to meet sam Collins once, it was the best
Omg yess
The name sounds familiar, is he a YouTuber?
u/Skullyta is also my trans icon
I also choose u/Skullyta
No, own it! It’s great to inspire yourself :)
Hell yeah!
I literally had no idea that’s amazing! I guess she’s my icon too now.
Yes, 100%! But for me, another trans composer I really admire is Wendy Carlos. She was an extremely influential pioneer in electronic music, and she transitioned all the way back in the 70s!
YEEEES! She’s so pretty too!
Fuckin love Lena Raine
on this note, Madeline from Celeste. Great name, stole it myself
wait is she trans? I love her music so much but I had no idea
I love Hunter Schafer
yess!! Hunter Schafer<33
Agree 1000% she is so cool!
Jules as a character makes me feel so conflicted about liking Hunter Schafer 😭😭 why’d she have to be such an awful person in the show
A fellow spud! Much love 💕
Absolutely! I even got my middle name from him!
I actually did a presentation on Jamie Raines in english class lol, I got an A for it :)
love me some 100 gecs
I’m pretty sure I heard of them!
Based
me too
Fml
Yes 🥺🥺💖
I agree, she is awesome!
She went to high school with my younger sis :p

But that also unfortunately meant she was my sister's reference point for trans people when I came out.
Hate to be that person but it's maddy thorson not maddie thorson
came here to say the same thing!! Maddy is kind of the reason i'm considering changing my major and going into the video game industry.
Celeste is such a beautiful game!! Lena Raine is definitely my trans icon
Lena Raine also made Pigstep
Lena Raine also did a couple tracks for Minecraft!
I love Laura! Against me is a god tier band
They don’t have to be popular! That is why I said YOUR trans icon.
>Her coming out video helped me crack my own egg.

Same here. It really cracked what remained of my egg at that point and truely triggered an ""oooooh shiiiit"" moment in my head.
Lmao, Abigale was the name I picked to replace my old one. Ironic.
Came here to make sure she was represented :D
I love Jammi sm! I actually put Sam Collins as my choice. Go trans YouTube Icons!
he craked my egg lol
omg i love him he’s so wholesome and nice!
I love Jammidodger!! He should be a role model for all men, not just trans ones!
watching him transition over the years saved my life, hes amazing
I love Jamie!!!
I was really surprised when my dad told me he watches her show on TV. I didn't think he'd like it, but I guess it brought some awareness to him which I'm very thankful for.
I was shown some of her story in 7th grade health class, it was very eye opening
♥️ ND
Thanks for mentioning ND! Apart from the obvious glorious gay masterwork that is SPOP, I also love really love Lumberjanes
YASSS! I’m so sad she is gone. The first time I ever heard about her is when I saw a TikTok post about her when she past away.
Right? She also helped me through the very early stages of my transition
I am right with y'all on this one.  I started watching Euphoria as my egg was cracking.   I still can't get Jewels out of my head tho
i just finished euphoria too i love it sooo much
Absolutely
Ditto. She may be “canceled” and “problematic” and whatever, but she’s still made tons of content that has educated and entertained me
Same here, the trans space wouldn’t be in the same place without her. I love a lot about her, where she’s been and can’t wait to see where she’s going!🙂
Jamie Clayton really is a trans woman and she’s in the L Word
Wow!
came here to say this, hes amazing, makes me jealous tho, his new songs amazing
Came here to say this!
I have a whole playlist of underachiever on repeat like 20 times
YEAH!!!!! I LOVE WENDY CARLOS
omg yes
the mother of electronic music
Omg how have I never heard of her I just looked her up and she’s actually my new trans icon
Had to scroll way too find for nat
So... Funny story. I used to love this band when I was younger. But sadly my family was very conservative and so my own transphobia made me stop listening to them when she came out. Now I have come full circle, the music isn't the same to me anymore but I respect the band.

A little sad as I could mimic her old voice perfectly! And Spike's.
Ooooo
Same. Rabbit is my queen 🌹
came here to say this!
She was the first trans person I saw on German TV as a teenager! Learned about HRT and dysphoria from her 😊
I had no idea! Several of her songs on my Spotify.
she is trans but not rlly a good person, wouldnt call her an icon
Excellent addition
Patti Harrison is amazing. I’m changing my answer, I loved her show on seriouslyTV called Conversation Therapy where she interviews trans people and then converts them back to cis at the end with a different ‘machine’ like a paper cup or a ping pong table
So happy other people chose Jamie. She's such a fucking great actress. Plus she's gonna be the new Pinhead for Hellraiser which is hella exciting.
No one said it has to be a pop star!
Mia Violet's book helped me a lot too.  Also agree on the other 3 you mentioned.
Arca is amazing yes
🥰🥰🥰 Her!!
Wholesome!!
Slay
I listen to her work every day, it helps with so much
I used to talk to her often,  met her on realself we began our transition around the same time.  I'm sure she'd appreciate this :)
Wow!
I follow her on TikTok and Snapchat
I love that your elevating your classmate to icon status! Not saying famous representation isn’t extremely valuable and necessary, but non famous trans folk in our real lives are also so important! It’s super heartwarming to see someone who understands that 💕🥰
I’d forgotten about her, thanks for the reminder!
Yes, love her!
I was hoping someone would say Sheiky baby!!
YESSS!!
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS COMMENT FOR TOO LONG!!
Damnnn
Jessie Gender recognition !! She's fantastic
Wow! That is interesting.
Oh my
Can you you post some links? I’ve had a look but not managed to find much about her
💖💖💖💖
Slay
Oooo! I might watch it.
But why tho?
This person must have a thing for degradation.
Oh! And I couldn't go without mentioning Sophie From Mars too. Excellent video essayist, streamer and political educator
I’m sorry but not Kim-
YAS ARCA
I’m sorry but not Kim-
And Sam Collins lmao
Not Kim I’m sorry
He's also in Inception but you probably won't recognize him. T is one hell of a magic
I think he might have been in a movie or two.
Aaaand in trailer park boys as Treena
[removed]
And Noah Finnce 🧡
yES
I'm so fucking jealous. 

I would love to meet him. I bet I'd make him feel real awkward, but the dude helped me sm. I love a ton of trans YouTubers, but he was the only one I watched before my egg cracked. 

I did get featured on his LGBTQ story segment on his Outspoken Podcast one time haha
Here I was, thinking I was off base xD
Yeah
Legend right there
same i had no idea omg
She’s not awful . She’s hurt, just like everyone else in the show.
she’s acting
Hey spuds
Awww, that sounds so fun and educational ✨
Girl from 100 gecs
Unfortunately?
heck thank you! i’ll fix
Because, God bless your transexual heeeeart
[deleted]
Laura's solo work feels so underrated. I've been an Against Me! fan for decades...but her solo stuff is also phenomenal and always makes me feel good.
Yes, I love Lumberjanes too!  Nimona is just as good.
So sad :(  Arca is an amazing trans musician who was her friend too
The “Shame” video put me on a path to discovering my own lesbotic tendencies, and I will always have her to thank for that
She’s also starring as pinhead in the upcoming hell raiser movie IIRC
yeahhhh >:D
She is amazing.
She is amazing and gave me hope for the world and acceptance right before I came out publicly. 
I hated she had to fight so hard to transition but I'm so glad she had a supportive family that was able to advocate with them. I love her music too! 🥰
[removed]
You say she's not a good person for being in a contact with a bad person, but I see no difference in being under rules of a terrible government or having to work for a company that supports crappy laws because you have to make money to survive. You can NOT say she's not great for that. It's not her direct actions. You can only say she has to work for a crappy person. Older generations of trans people like her or myself had to do what we could to survive. By saying this you would also be saying no one could be an icon because they had to do things with terrible people sometimes. Its a logical fallacy.
I didn’t know about her playing Pinhead, that’s really awesome!

I enjoy her music idk
Anti-cistamines
And Juno, I mean what a role to play. A pregnant teen. I wonder how on earth that worked.
He played kitty pryde in xmen, and he was in Juno as juno
At least 2.
Ooooo. What shows or movies are they in?
Yesss and Miles McKenna
Noah is my faaaavorite.  I love him.  Shame he doesn't ever tour the US
The way that we met was so fucking random lol. I was on Omegle and we met each other on the same tab. I instantly recognized him, we talked for like 15 minutes, and now he follows my abandoned Twitter account lol
Ofc not XD
We are *very* different.  I was always the tough, masculine kid in my family.  And my sister was trying to wrap her head around me, the 5'11, 218lb tough guy being into makeup and boys.  She didn't know trans tomboys or lesbians existed.
I've got used to correcting that spelling as its also my name lol
Same. My life changed reading that book. I had previously accepted myself as trans before reading and after reading I felt like I could run through a wall.
i loved Arca before she got into nfts etc lol
That’s just really awesome 🙂 She is very good at taking things apart and explaining it in a way you may never have thought of. I love her humour but I just find her so easy to relate to, despite me having relatively little similar to her.
Oooh that sounds awesome! I’ll have to check it out.
the producer she primarily works with has multiple sexual assault accusations and she refuses to address it or quit working with him
honestly I didn't either til I googled her to see if I'd seen her since Sense8. Now I'm super excited to see the new Hellraiser and that's a pretty hard thing for Hellraiser to do hahaha
It’s not that it’s just that she is a bad person.
LMAO
Buddy was also in Inception.
[removed]
So many iconic men!
We have a lot of amazing Canadian and European guys on YouTube. Sucks when ya live in the states lol
I wish Sam Collins followed my abandoned Twitter
Oh yeah, I love how she really thoroughly talks you through her thought process. That PhD-DNF in philosophy is working out well for her 😂
I haven’t heard much about this, but is it possible that she’s locked into a contract and has had to sign a non-disclosure agreement? I’m just trying to give her the benefit of the doubt because I do like her a lot
[removed]
Stole from another redditor lol
I heard of the Orange is the new Black!
I love rocky horror for one song lol
Wait who in rocky horror?? I love that movie it was so big for trans and gay peeps back then lol
Ikr? Also, I'll just add - Ty Turner
She wasn’t actually signed to him until recently when she willingly entered a contract fully aware of everything he did.
no shes been working with dr luke for kost of her career
She also has a small role in Promising Young Woman
They’re also in ‘Inventing Anna’
She is in the new remake from 2016 (I think). The remake is called ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show - Let's do the time warp again"". 


I mean the problem with Rocky horror is that... Well, on one hand, it's not great to present LGBTQ+ people as strange freaks, but on the other hand, this film is a classic. And for a lot of us, this film and the culture surrounding it helped us find who we are (even tho we aren't freaks like in the movie).
One thing I like in the new film is that they changed Dr. Frank'n'furter's pronouns, so everyone is calling her she/her now. I mean this is no excuse for presenting her as a freak, but this film just is a classic.
I like Kade Cooks :)
Ah. Well that’s not great.
I'll add Leo Mateus"	togfdd	trans	772	0.99	2022-03-26 04:00:56
I look sad bc my apt to get e prescribed was cancelled last minute :(		"Geezzz....I would have thought you were a cis female.   HRT is going to take you someplace amazing girl!  Good for you.
Mine was cancelled too! 3 hours before because the doctor called out of work :/
That sucks. But also? If this is you before e, WOW
Hugs. The anxiety build up must have been rough to go through to not get the reward
W h a t how does this happen pre-e?? The human body is incredible & you are stunning. Sorry you got canceled.
SadGirl vibe!  😔  But don't fret!  You're ALREADY well on the way!  🌹
You’re already so pretty!
I’m sorry you are sad! I would be too shy to ask you out but you are beautiful.
Omg baby you're so pretty 🥺
Bummer
Aw sorry to here that but your still cute and this is a great outfit too. Really thinking about starting e but I’m not sure yet 🤷
Lovely face and a nice pair of legs. Keep up the good work and thanks for posting.
Agreed. Can someone get in here with some upvotes please?
Me three. Was meant to get my first prescription first thing tomorrow, but lab is slow due to covid. Have to wait a couple more weeks.

No, Trans Women Do NOT Have an Advantage Over Other Women, Caitlyn Jenner!	"Sorry if this is a rant, everyone, but what truly pisses me off is how the media loves to talk down on the transgender community. Like for what? It's mostly the same recycled crap that was fed to gay people. I'll be glad when we get the recognition we deserve too, because I feel like it divides the LGBT community. If I simply type in ""transgender,"" I see nothing but article after article attacking some woman who was just achieving her dreams. Seriously, she's not hurting anyone and is most likely on estrogen. She's my age. I'm not sure how long Lia's been on E, but I've been on T for over 3 years. 3 years! If she's transitioned as long as I have, there is no way she has a disadvantage over other women. HRT alters muscle and bones if you start early enough. I know because it changed my body permanently, and my upper body is waaaaayyyy stronger now. Trans women shouldn't be berated over who they are just because they won a championship. Seriously, I don't get it. Media fabricates it to look like she's just intruding, misgendering her, like trans women don't deserve a role model, or like cisgender women always lose. 

The fact that Caitlyn Jenner is so willing to advocate against transgender women havung the freedom to do what she couldn't do just isn't fair and selfish to me. There are many of us on the fence, who would love to be on a team as who we truly are, but are discouraged by this. IT's obvious and appalling that she's working for terfs and right-wing liberals who hate transgender people for any accomplishment they have, especially transgender women—just to give herself a pedestal. If she truly believes the crap she spews, that trans women are in it to ""destroy women"" and need to be grouped with the male division, maybe she should just speak for *herself*. How can a trans woman be so naive about her own identity? Not to mention all of the other things out there about her seemingly misgendering herself to a blind transphobic eye and announcing that she allows her kids to, calling her ""dad,"" so some terf will expect every trans person to want the same. 

Psssh. Me personally, my kids won't even be allowed to call me ""Mr. Mom"" let alone ""mom."" Some of us take our identity and lives more seriously, taking precaution when sharing so much stuff that can be misconstrued by the transphobic media that she gladly shares with. Cis people don't get that she does not speak for every trans person, but really just herself. I get she's non-dysphoric, and that is fine, but why publically announce these things if you're so in touch with people's OPINIONS on trans people? She's the reason why there's so many terf novels, and people refusing to understand or take us seriously. She's a true ""transtrender,"" since she's also sadly the most known trans individual for her reputation. It's a shame *she's* taking advantage of who she is, clowning herself to hold us back — when she doesn't realize terfs hate her too, whether she sides with them or not. She should cut that out. Someone her age should know better than to bully so many young women and out of jealousy since she had to compete with men. Some ""trans mom."" SMFH"	"As a trans woman who is also a competition fighter this gets brought up all the time by even organisers, I represent our clubs mixed team so I fight in the mixed gender category so its not an issue luckily, however at our last tournament the organisers came over and told the team that if I wanted to fight in the women's category I would have to fight in the weight class above my own cause of my biological advantage so its fair, I am at the bottom of my current weight class as the lightest fighter in that class for them mixed in the whole tournament. When on of my female team mates asked if she could fight in the male fights for the weight class below hers as that should be the same they told her she couldn't cause it would be dangerous to have people from different weight classes fighting. Anyway I got second in the mixed category after getting my head kicked in by this incredibly talented woman. So my ""advantage"" didn't help me there.
Yep in terms of sports, the science/data backs you up, at least for trans people that have been on HRT/Hormones for certain amount of years. If anyone says that trans women/men have any advantage in sports then they are quite literally denying science and data.

In other aspects of life nah, Trans people do not have any sort of advantage and anyone who says so is just a transphobe
Caitlyn Jenner has advantages over other women.

She’s cartoonishly rich.
Sports is just the go-to weapon of choice for transphobes right now. A lot of people are passionate about sports and trans women beating cis women in sports might seem more believable to the uneducated than trans people being pedohiles or invading bathrooms to assault people.
It’s very frustrating, science doesn’t seem to matter at all nor be desired on this topic.

OP of it is basically being a transphobe and disagreeing with science, its sad to read through the post and some of the comments. How people can deny science and think they're being a good ally to trans people is beyond me.

Trans people do not have any sort of advantage at all over cis people in and out of sports
Too many people take sports more seriously than human rights.
I'm 100% with you on the issue of sports - transgender women should compete in woman's sports. All the data and science backs that up. I also agree how incredibly frustrating it is that Caitlyn Jenner, to a lot of people, is seen as the main ""voice of trans woman"" - I'm absolutely not a fan of hers and her views that she proudly shares with the world are deeply problematic for trans people.

I did want to talk about her kids calling her ""dad"" and that general concept. I'm a binary trans woman whose son calls her ""daddy"". I started my transition after he could talk and already was referring to me as daddy and I didn't want to give that name up. We tried some different ones and nothing felt right; I realized I was trying to force another name just to match typical gender norms and so I said ""screw it"". The way he excitedly exclaims ""Daddy!"" just melts my heart, I clearly formed a strong emotional connection to the name my son calls me. I tear up at the thought of giving that up and I don't feel like I'm taking my identity or my life less seriously because of that.

Now of course it's completely valid for trans people to feel uncomfortable being referred to as their AGAB's typical parent name and want to go with the one that matches their actual gender (in my case that would be going with ""mom"" or ""mommy""). I am very strict with everyone else in my life about using correct pronouns (she/her) and my chosen feminine name. What I'm trying to say is it is all valid. I would be cautious of starting down the road of referring to certain trans people as less serious about their gender identity and less valid for simply not conforming to the restrictive gender norms society expects.
Yes thank you for writing that. I'm endlessly annoyed seeing people that don't understand anything about the science and biology around trans people try to argue about this. It's almost always bad faith arguments that come from purposeful ignorance and bigotry. It also comes from defining and seeing trans women as ""biological males"" which in most people's minds means biologically the exact same as cis men.

If someone was truly arguing about it in good faith and evidence based science then we could actually make sure things are fair, safe, inclusive and equal. Based on the science it is fair for little kids that are prepuberty to play and compete against each other regardless of gender. Then once puberty starts it is acknowledged that people with CAIS (biologically male but androgen insensitive) can fairly compete against women. So there should not be any argument against teens on puberty blockers and hormones competing as their gender. If someone cannot accept even this, which is completely fair biologically and well understood then the problem is not about biological advantages and unfairness and it's about transphobia only.

There is some uncertainty about the performance of trans people that went through their first puberty before transitioning and how that compares to the difference between cis men and cis women. There is a massive lack of scientific research here and that's what's being exploited by transphobes. There's a lot to say about the current research and it does look in favor of trans people competing fairly but there is still not much data. If there are provable and demonstrable unfair advantages or disadvantages that go beyond what performance enhancing polymorphisms provide then maybe we could look into how to help trans athletes compete fairly by researching the differences between trans and cis performance and what can be done about it.
Every time someone pulls the 'trans women have an advantage in sports because of tEsToStErOnE' card all I can think of is how the last few times I've gotten bloodwork done my testosterone levels have been lower than those of an average cis woman because of HRT.
Scientific evidence has shown that if anything, transitioning actually gives trans women a disadvantage. I don't know whether that's true from a biological perspective but collected data reports that the vast majority of trans women that compete in sports come in the middle of the pack. If this narrative were true we'd be regularly dominating the women's sports scene. We're not. The trans women that do rank in first or near it work damn hard to get there.
Caitlyn Jenner really needs to get her head out of her ass.  She may have an advantage over others because she’s super fucking wealthy.  Not your average trans woman who might face much more hardships and disadvantages compared to cis people.  People like her do not make it better or easier for trans people to gain more tolerance and acceptance.
Caitlyn Jenner does NOT represent the entire transgender community. She doesn’t even represent all transgender women. She and many cisgender people only think she does, but in reality Caitlyn Jenner only represents herself.
I think the current NCAA qualification rules are a fair solution that should be a model to follow in schools. At least 1 year continuous on HRT (and remaining on HRT) for athletic eligibility. At that point natural advantages are mostly reversed.  I see it as a good compromise between fairness and inclusitivity.
I avoid being taken in by anti trans athlete arguments because I honestly know little about sports or athletics. Like, anti-trans people expect us to be experts in everything. To answer all their questions, I would need a deep knowledge of sports history, biology, sociology. And I don't really think facts would change their mind because transphobes aren't gonna be asking any of this in good faith. 

Instead of playing their game, I would ask transphobes why they suddenly give a damn about women's sports. Where were they when women were being paid pennies on the dollar compared to their male counterparts? Where were they when coaches faced repeated sexual assault and rape claims? And most importantly, where is their evidence that transgender women are dominating in sports? 

The nonsensical arguments of talking heads is ultimately just hot air. I would try not to get worked up over it
I agree with you. They should be treated equally. Just because trans women want to be who they want, doesn't mean others should judge them for it
Reasons why I don't reveal my trans status to any of the physical activities I participate in. People crap on Lia now they crapped on Fallon Fox, Chloe Jonnson had to sue crossfit to compete because they disqualified her for being trans. Like it's a nightmare and in it were told we can't participate in sports, we are told we shouldn't participate in fashion after the outrage for Valentina Sampaio becoming a VS model.

Like no one wants us anywhere and it's sad.
""It's a shame she's taking advantage of who she is, clowning herself to hold us back"". good word choice.
Reminder that Caitlyn Jenner transitioned when she did to avoid being charged with vehicular manslaughter. That said, she's just an awful mouthpiece for cishets and the right wing to use however they desire, they know she doesn't give a shit about the queer community and will happily generalize every trans person's experience to her disconnected richest 1% daydream.
This is why I wouldn’t want to be any kind of famous or well-known, being trans. There’s just too much stigma. 

And I think “society” will always be transphobic, unfortunately. I think it only gets worse from here as the cis-het conservative backlash moves on. We’re their new bogeyman, the way gay people were in the 90s and atheists were in the 00s.
I have nothing positive to say about Caitlin and hate that she has somehow become a person that represents the trans community because she is rich and I'm a firm believer in allowing athletes to compete as their gender but I completely disagree with you on allowing her kids to call her dad.  I transitioned later when my youngest was 15 and the oldest 24.  I am and always will be their dad and I am proud for them to refer to me as dad.  I also realize that not everyone would feel the same way and would want to be called something else and if that is what you want then that is perfectly fine and you should do what feels right to you but don't start criticizing other with a different take as it easily comes off as we are not ""trans enough"" unless we conform to your ideals.
It's intersectional. All else being equal Cis men have advantage over cis women but cis women have advantage over trans women. Because trans women may (MAY) spend time as presenting as a cis man, it becomes intersectional.

Caitlyn is such a cunt.  Can someone please take her crown?
Goofy.

HRT can add, but it cannot take away.  It can give you boobs, but it can’t take away your boobs.  It can give you strength, but it can’t take away your strength.

Your experience taking testosterone is not the same as a male’s experience taking estrogen.
I'm a trans woman and grad student and regularly do women's intramural sports as something to do just so I'm active and not completely socially isolated doing dissertation research all the time.

I absolutely \*suck\* at said women's sports. I actually \*like\* basketball, but even then, last time I played in the women's basketball tournament, my team lost in the first round 15-2.

And then there was me playing women's volleyball when I couldn't hit the ball over the net the entire game.... and the fact that my 5k run times are actually in the low average range for \*women\* in my age bracket...

I do these sports because I like doing it and being physically active, but if you watch me perform it's damn obvious that I am not \*remotely\* at an advantage to other girls and am low average at best. It's clear that the people saying they think trans women have an advantage have never actually seen a trans woman perform athletically.
[deleted]
Actually there's a bit of nuance here. Those who took puberty blockers and hrt see no significant benifit. Unathletic trans women who became athletic after transition likewise saw no significant benifit.

The only group that showed any advantage were high-performing athletes, and even then it was only for specific events. Namely, events to focused on strength such as lifting. Swimming, running, and technique based sports saw no significant advantage.

And even where there was an advantage, such as with power lifting, there was a noticeable loss in said advantage over time. So basically trans women DO have an advantage, but only in a vanishingly small number of events, only when they were near professional athlete level pre-transition, only when they never stop training after transition, and seemingly only for a temporary amount of time.

Edit: I want to make something clear: I'm steelmanning the opposing arguement. There's very little research into this topic and what little does exist is lacking in a lot of ways. Once you weed out the terrible studies (ill elaborate down below), what little does exist finds no advantage outside of a few studies that specifically looked at high level athletes who transitioned. 

In generally, mildly or non-athletic folks who transition will see no advantage besides maybe height. I didn't see much good evidence asserting blood oxygen levels are higher in trans athletes, which is a common right wing talking point. I also didn't see evidence that trans women have an advantage in sports of endurance or technique. There is evidence that trans women have a disadvantage in swimming, though again there's not much research.

As for the study i referenced, the researcher measured thigh circumference and made the assumption that sush a measurement is correlative to overall strength. On top of small sample sizes, she failed to isolate a bunch of variables such as height, body fat composition, weight, and more. That's all on top of the fact that said researcher in question was a TERF

shit I was in a women's basketball tournament in December as a trans woman.... our team lost 15-2 in the first round and I fell flat on my back halfway through the match. And that's not counting the women's volleyball game where I couldn't hit the ball over the net. Some advantage I have lol...

Also I've been a distance runner since high school and my run times have \*dropped\* like 10 minutes on HRT, and are now in the low average range for \*women\* in my age bracket.

Been on HRT for almost 4 years.

What about Lia Thomas whose swim times literally blow cis women's olympic winning times to pieces? This conversation is not cut and dry.
There is no advantage, hence why we are constantly seeing biological women competing in mens leagues, oh wait….
Hot take: rich people aren't people and what they think doesn't matter.
[deleted]
i guess they'll keep changing the story to fit their narrative
which is so stupid too because if you've ever seen trans women compete in women's sports you'd see how silly the idea of a ""biological advantage"" is. 

Like... if we had so much of an advantage, how come I can't hit the ball over the net in women's volleyball? And how come my basketball team got knocked out of the women's basketball tournament last month in the first round with a 15-2 loss?  And how come my 5k run times are low average for women in my age bracket?

Its Because for the conservative it's not really about science, sports or fairness, it's about hate, it's about marginalizing us. They never cared about women's sports and they still don't, it's just a useful tool at this moment
right, and they say *we* ignore science
Calling Ben Shapiro anything but by his name has to be one of my favorite running jokes. I like calling him bep shapeepo

>Trans people do not have any sort of advantage at all over cis people in and out of sports

Source: trust me bro
It's so dumb... I actually \*like\* sports... but I like \*playing\* them, and love the social bonding experience and keeping fit. That's all I'm in it for. 

I really don't understand the obsession with competition that so many people have surrounding it, like their entire self worth and identity is riding on winning.
Yeah, but she's telling terfs/transphobic media outlets something that is personal, that can easily be misconstrued out of proportion to the point where they believe we all would feel this way, or that feeling this way means gives them a right to misgender us. It's different if she shared that in a transfriendly forum like you did. She shouldn't tell people who could care less about us about her life like that. 

The problem is her hypocrisy though; it just doesn't make herself look bright doing what she's doing.

It fuels the transphobia we face, and cis people who can't even wrap their heads around why someone would need to transition just won't get it. They can't even get something as self-defining as gender dysphoria. All of her actions now tell me that maybe she feels insecure about herself. Even if she's projecting hate towards other trans women, it speaks volumes for how she must feel about herself, being unable to emphathize with transgender people to the degree that she is for cis people who are unoppressed (unless racially, culturally or religously). I don't think I've ever seen her come up and say something that advocates for us, shutting down the hate we receive rather than to turn a blind eye to it. I'm glad she didn't become governor, and fear if she did. I would hate to see her try and take away medical access — knowing her, she probably would support anything that is against us and our wellbeing
very lesbian of you to be a woman who likes being called daddy
Didn't the NCAA change that a couple days ago? Basically abdicated the responsibility and threw it to individual sport's ruling bodies?
Exactly! If trans people and youths were given rights and equality, and were made to be safe in their family and homes then many trans youths wouldnt have gone through the wrong puberty.

Many trans youth have to live in hiding until they can move out of their family home because they are in an unsafe family and cant speak out or get medical help for their transitioning and identity until well after puberty.

I had to go through the male puberty despite knowing i was trans since I was a young child, and i couldnt speak up about myself because I was in a very religious family, that i often got physically and verbally abused in. So i stayed quiet until i was in a more supportive and safe environment. I had no other option but to go through the wrong puberty
Nope, just the transphobes and terfs don't. Let's not scatter and allow them to decimate our representation. Gay people dealt with the same thing until people realized gay people weren't going anywhere because it was never a choice. Same for us. Sadly, terfs will probably try to discourage us for another decade or two, since it was only the late 90's when clinical trials became available. That's why that stupid crossdresser stereotype is out there, cementing the hard past that the trans generations that came before us endured before HRT..
Caitlyn Jenner is a TRANSGENDER TERF. That's clowning herself, since I never knew you could be BOTH transgender and a terf. I can't see how she can give a greenlight to gatekeep trans women from competing where they belong, and invalidating like that WHILE telling her that it is ""good for her to be playing as her authentic self."" Seriously contradicting herself, and she is a seen as the one transgender with a voice out of all of us, just because of her children's careers. I mean who doesn't know the Kardashians.

If she was cis, she's just be a terf. There is undeniable internalized transphobia going on even if she is just allowing transphobic people to use her as a commanding voice for them. Idk how she's just taking charge of women's leagues. I get she is a retired Olympic gold medalist, but she shouldn't take advantage of an opportunity to do something right for her community for a change rather than trying to speak for all of us in a negative light. She should either defend this girl who is *50 years younger than her*, old enough to be her grand child, or decline to comment since they're probably not going to listen to her if she says something to validate us. 

I'm just imagining myself as Lia or any other trans woman who is excluded based off of a stereotype that has NO EVIDENCE to back it up, stringing this rumor along like she could care less. That's fucked up. If that isn't clowning around, idk what is. She calls herself an advocate for the transgender community, when she is a transgender terf, pushing the very transphobic rhetoric that is getting especially trans women killed. 

If she's not in it for the money terfs will pay her so that her reputation among the transgender community is destroyed, and greenlighting conversion therapy to scare particularly women and girls who are trans from following their dreams, then what is she doing? Why would she want people of this generation to live like the people in the 70s-90s (when she was forced to compete with men) to go through what she did? That was conversion therapy if you really think about it since clinical trials for HRT to help trans people (when it was around for 60 years) only become available for us about 25 years ago, so that's how the ""crossdressing"" confusion came about since we were gatekept. I would HATE for things to go  back to that, but I guess she's envious of the new opportunities this generation of trans people have. I'm a bit envious of those who got peri instead of DI and hormonal blockers to skip that first puberty, but you don't see me advocating to gatekeep
that is true. i think the only reason why she's the mouthpiece is because it's like she's following a transphobic script based off of stereotypes
... transitioning doesn't improve your odds in the justice system, ever. Being rich enough to afford great lawyers does. She's bad enough without making stuff up
I'm sorry. I updated the sentence.
seriously. Why do people associate her with being a spokesperson for the trans community? Literally the entire community hates her ass, and there's so many other prominent trans figures you \*could\* be using instead, like Rachel Levine, Sarah McBride, Nicole Maines, or Laverne Cox.
Man I went from being able to lift over 100 pounds+ easy to having issues with 50+. Also sports are literally about who's genetically better in the first place but no one admits it. Basketball? Be tall... cycling? Endurance... hell Michael Phelps has double jointed ankles which give him better kicking range so get this ""born genetically different"" out of here if you won't call out all of it. Cause it just sounds like whining.
regularly**
**FYI being trans is more than feelings, I already know I'm a whole ass dude if you ignore this post like most who hate the truth do. also, believing everything Caitlyn says for all trans people is naive. With her logic, I'd go to jail for trespassing on women's sports since I have normal male Testosterone levels and am larger than most of the dudes in my family, towering at 6'2 (5 inches taller than my pops) As long as I take my weekly stomach shots, work out and eat right, I will always have the advantage Lia is accused of having with baseless claims made by people who don't know her and are exploiting her for money**

I clearly stated in the first paragraph that HRT alters bones and muscle if you start early enough. I didn't have significant bone changes from the first puberty at all. If you counter in science, the bones don't reach the peak mass until the age of 30, declining within every decade to follow. Lia is 22, and likely is on estrogen, and has been for a while (don't know her personally). This will be just a guess. Everyone's body is different. 

The argument *is* scientific because it's not an opinion, not guesses like those made about Lia without even seeing her play or looking at her league's stats. 

I'll use myself as an example since I'm the same age as her and transgender as well. 

I started T at the age of 18, shortly before my 19th birthday. Despite trying to adapt to the lifestyle of a cis woman, I've always been clocked as a man, so estrogen's effect on me was subtle. Just before I started T, I noticed the hip bones begin to widen, after gathering so much fat that I was unaware that it wasn't. Jumbo thighs and huge butts run in my family, for both the men and the women. The only thing estrogen really did was inhibit my ability to lose the weight in my lower body and gain upper body weight. 

My facial structure and bones are something I'm happy about since it's apparent just how the testosterone my body produced had the upper hand when it came to these characteristic gems. Even my height is around the 90th male percentile, because starting T resumed the growth presumed to of been stunted from the age of 14 up until 19. I grow around 0.15-0.5cm a month on average, so subtly it tastes months to notice. I'm someone who revolves my diet and my supplemental intake on my transition, not just take testosterone. I do this because I am not on E-blockers and haven't had an easy way of accessing it, like many transgender individuals. Due to my genetic makeup: inherited growth spurts, delayed puberty (i noticed it all began when I was 8, with breast development, but noticed stuff still happening 10 years later) Luckily, the women on my mom's side particularly have higher T levels than average, and can grow small beards or facial hair in general; this was a genetic lottery for me, since pretty much all the guys in my immediate family have facial hair that connects.

T squared out my jaw. I'd be more than happy to share pictures comparing my facial changes. Some are muscle, some are bone. I had an alien-like, long egg head before, with a skinny pixie chin. Now my face is wide and boxy. Rather than recede like I naturally appeared to without T's influence, my hairline grew IN, back to the original strong widow's peak that I was born with.

I take stem cells and do clay masks regarly, so I notice evolution to a higher degree. The general life of the cells in your body is 7 years, sometimes up to 10. This is usually around the time (6-12 yrs) when trans people feel the most content. Their changes depend heavily on the receptors in the body, responsible for regulating the body's individual response.

I am a body builder so my cells are always rejuvenating. Estrogenized cells that may be still present 3 years in, given the lifespan of cells, are killed and replaced by cells that responded more heavily to testosterone before and after HRT.

This doesn't mean that testosterone is stronger or better, just that my own genetic makeup responded more to it. 

Estrogen and female are seen as the default settings in development, so the face, arms, feet and voice don't grow or develop nearly as much — and will remain almost prepubescent-like only if the estrogenic receptors are weaker. Testosterone has a heavy influence on bones, not just estrogen. We can't forget, estrogen does too. Trans women who start soon enough may notice permanent hip changes, and a ceize in the widening of the shoulders and back.

That being said, if Lia is just as far as me in this, she does not have an advantage. Caitlyn Jenner is either full of sh*t, or she really wants the world to go back to pretending that trnsgender people is a 20th century phdnomenon that cannot be debunked in anyway with facts and science. Do your own research before you decide to have a debate. I gave my facts, and you have to give yours if you are worthy of a response from me, or I take it you have none because such an article contradicting doctors and science do not exist. 

Why should men join women's leagues and not women? I'm a real man, who needs testosterone to have a normal day to day life, or else something would be missing from my life that a man shouldn't be robbed of. I will never go off of T or fulfill the dreams of hypocrite, uneduacated terfs or be indoctrinated into the puppetry Caitlyn Jenner is in, to fill the needs of other people's lives just because *they're insecure that I exist.*

Instead, I'll keep existing along with different species of transgender animals out there. God even made transgender people who can develop a penis at the age of 12. Mine is developing much later, despite the micro dimensions it retains so far, I'd rather it than a vagina. I can jerk it, unsheathe it, and penetrate — before going under any knife (sorry if TMI) but men can't help but value our penises like women value their breasts. A phallus is homologous, meaning shared among almost every living thing of any gender preference, so saying someone is dickless like many of you presumably transphobic or naive people do is way more unscientific sounding to me. Women just don't want to call it a penis and estrogen keeps the development of the penis in people who are AFAB in limbo just to keep your precious heterosexuality alive. That doesn't mean that facts care about your feelings over mine. 

**FYI being trans is more than feelings, I already know I'm a whole ass dude if you decide to ignore this like most who hate the truth do. also, believing everything Caitlyn says for all trans people is naive. If you're a dude who's heterosexual, it's kinda gay to think we could end up in the bed together over the ambiguity of genetalia of chromosomes alone, and that you'd kiss my hairy face and stroke my swollen 100% masculinized muscles, don't you think?**
This is definitely something I have thought about. People's perception of sports is skewed by only watching elite athletes where every little advantage helps. They don't consider that most people (who play for fun or compete at amateur level) have only average talent/athleticism in sports and half of people are worse than that.



THEN consider that a lot of trans people (not all, of course) would shy away from sports as a kid because of their dysphoria or social reasons, but might be willing to try post transition/later in life. Not that late starters can't be talented or anything, but obviously people who train from childhood have an advantage.
I mean this is like saying all black people are better athletes.  Strength and height are only one equation into being a great athlete, however there is a reason why there are sayings like, you can't teach height.    


I don't understand why Lia Thomas whether she is Ledecky good or just good for her weak division matters. From my perspective I think people want to make this a trans right issue but from my small mind I see the division the same reason we have men and women's sports. Again people will constantly point out how Thomas would be considered a high school star but no where near Olympic level, thus poses no real danger to cis women's sports, but that not the issue since in men's baseball not everyone who takes steroids automatically becomes Mark McGuire or Sammy Sosa and hits 70 homeruns a season, just like not ever trans athlete will come close to Ledecky, but the point is Thomas in my eyes has a pure edge since since was able to cultivate a men's body for the majority of her life and only recently transitioned. It be one thing if while transitioning she loss most of her mass and shrunk 3"" but as she stands she is 6'1"" and 210lbs of muscle.
The kicker is that's not the trans person's fault, either. If society would get the fuck over itself, trans women wouldn't have had to go through the wrong puberty in the first place.
As a sort of side question branching off this: Since a person’s body is undergoing changes, particularly those early dates, is exercise or competition potentially more dangerous?
Its small and not always true, several studies have been done that have been peer reviewed and upheld have been able to show that there is no significant link between trans people and having an advantage against their cis counter part, and most transgender people had a negative experience with sports due.

So again, the difference/advantage seems to be insignificant for the majority of trans folk. 

A lot of the studies that have tried to come out showing that there is, have been pretty much all discredited and proven wrong due to various reasons. People have tried and failed at finding any significant or major advantage.
>The only group that showed any advantage were high-performing athletes, and even then it was only for specific events. Namely, events to focused on strength such as lifting. Swimming, running, and technique based sports saw no significant advantage.

Quick question: can you please link me to the study/studies with these findings?  In researching this topic, I'm only locating sources that claim the opposite. Thank you!
Wouldn't there be a lingering advantage in events where height is helpful? For those women who transition later of course. Basketball, volleyball, high jump etc.
This argument is total bs. The fact that you are not a competent athlete doesn't mean that all the scientific date is invalid.
Heres one of the many studies that have disproven the lie that trans people have advantages in sports, when they dont. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/

But also do you're own research lmao, the burden of proof isnt on me, it's transphobes like OP and those who agree to disprove what I and science have claimed.

And just look up the many video essayists, and left leaning people on YouTube that fight for trans peoples rights lmao, many of them have made videos going over the research, and studies that have been done as well as debating transphobes over it as well.

I love how whenever transphobes say anything they always make the other person do the research for them, regardless of if they are right or wrong, transphobes and their supporters always do the minimal amount of research before saying their dumb shit
No, her swim times are record-setting **for her school**, which is far from the best in the sport. 

she's nowhere near the women's swimming version of Michael Phelps. And she did quite well pretransition relative to men.

God, I wish trans women were all Wonder Woman. That would be awesome. Unfortunately it's not the case.
She doesn't though.. She was beaten recently by 3 cis women and a pre-transition trans man.  


https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/01/10/lia-thomas-university-pennsylvania-iszac-henig-yale-trans/
dan, do your research, dude. don't be a follower of fake news. lia's swim teammates who want to exclude her from the team, and blame her identity the moment she wins a medal are transphobic.
Yes it is, lmao anyone saying differently is just simply transphobic, when science overwhelmingly agrees that trans people have no athletic advantage over their cis counter parts.

Pretty much every single study that has come out against trans people in sports has been debunked and discredited.

Whereas pretty much every study thats for trans people in sports and proves that there is no advantage has pretty much been shown and upheld their findings.

So again, love how transphobes like you try to deny science whenever it doesnt back you up, but the moment you think science does you dont. Always funny how transphobes will turn their back to science whenever it doesnt agree, but any moment science does support something you say, you hold it near and dear as if you've ""always"" believed in science
No, we hate her because she’s a shitty person
No, it’s not her money, it’s the fact that she’s a massive hypocrite. I was merely poking fun at her hypocrisy and using her words against her.
She also killed someone and got off scott free because of a lack of evidence to convict her on manslaughter.
Right back at ya

The rest seem to be stupid journalists, or news trying to keep up with the trend withour actually doing an investigation because they aren't biology experts, nor do they specialize in HRT, psychology, or bloodwork of any kind of labwork NOR do they have a statistic of the truth of trans women since like you, many just go by opinion to quickly get their story out there when expected. It's kind of like working on radio. If you're unsure, you'd hate to admit.

Federal law is against discrimination in workplace/school settings against sex and gender identity, so this will never be an abroad thing - EVER LOL, unless Trump returned.

There it is folx, from the *experts*!!!

Fuck your feelings, buddy. If you want to fight for women's equality, WTF are you waiting for now?


Because this is the stupicy you're fighting for, men and women competing, downright contradicting yourself. Women would not feel protected at all with men who will never detransition like me. I'm so obviously male that month 2 on T, I started getting horrified looks when I went into women's restrooms. One picked up her daughter and left as soon as she came in and saw me, so I've used public men's rooms no problem ever since, even while it's packed. If this happened in CA, I'd join a sport just to screw with this unscientific transphobic craze (since conversion therapy is proven to be ineffective) and I have no reason to want to be off of Testosterone > https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/golf-archives/2022/01/25/luc-esquivel-trans-sports-ban-boys-and-mens-teams-daily-cover
For the conservatives, yes. I'm talking more broadly than that, because this issue in particular splits our allies, who listen to science about other things like Climate. (people who are allies on other trans issues)
It's pretty irrelevant tho. If science says that trans women have an unfair advantage, then that's it. Why bring politics into this?
Literally the same! 😂 Sben shporkbo, his transphobic ass has so many hilarious names and i love the meme. Ben Shaboobo
Ikr! I could just see their YouTube search history in my mind... ben Shabeebo, blaire white and other transphobes.

The thing that really showed me they were being bad faith was that anytime science was brought up they would blindly turn an eye to it and ignore anything to do with science, because they full on knew that science proved them wrong so they didnt want to acknowledge those comments.

And whenever called out for being transphobic they'd just turn around and act like a victim.. like at one point they tried to act victimized by saying ""well you havent been sexually assault and dealt with transphobes like i have"" 

Yet i had to go over the SA i've been through, and that i've dealt with transphobes IRL and one of them was even an ex who almost took my life over my trans based identity.

I just dont get how someone like him can be so transphobic but then turn around and say ""nuh uh! Im trans myself therefor Its impossible for me to be transphobic"" like.. have they never heard about ""self hating trans people"" such as Blaire White.

Like... How can you be so misled by the lies spread by transphobes to go into a trans community and be blatantly transphobic and make yourself out to be the victim by saying ""boo hoo ya'll are a hive mind and attacking me for being transphobic when im trans""
No, its called look things up for yourself? There are plenty of studies that have come out that have proven and shown that trans people do not have any significant advantage over their cis counter parts.

The funny thing is pretty much every study that has come out saying that ""they do have a significant advantage"" has been discredited and disproven.

I love when transphobes and people like you expect the other person to provide you with all the evidence and proof, but you're side never has to show any evidence or proof. 

Its almost like ya'll transphobes deny science when it doesnt benefit you, but will take the side of science if it does benefit you 🤔 weird how that happens isnt it, ya',ll never have to show any proof for your claims yet you expect the other side to show proof of their claims.

You're the one who has to show the burden of proof, since you're the ones trying to refute the claim that science overwhelmingly agrees with
trust me bro is not a source🤣🤣🤣
Totally - context is important! And there's a way to responsibly share details like the above. For instance, if I somehow ended up with a big platform and what my kids call me comes up I'd be honest but explain why and end with a ""Keep in mind though not every trans person will be comfortable with it like I am. Make sure you check and respect what each person wants!"" And I doubt she did that - I'm really not trying to defend Caitlyn Jenner. 

Just addressing the notion that trans women whose kids call them ""dad""(or vice versa with trans men) or do other gender non-conforming things are taking this all less seriously and are hurting trans people. 

If 'society' see's a trans woman whose kids call her ""dad"" and runs with it saying ""See! Even they see themselves as men!"" that's societies problem and ignorance. Not the trans woman who's just living her life and doing what's comfortable. She shouldn't have to cover up details like that and conform to society's gender norms for the sake of having cis people take us seriously.
she's talking about her kids
Exactly. Like the antiwork Fox interview in a lot of ways, she's cherry picked to be a scapegoat, to selectively define a movement to an audience. AND to confirm the right's ""truths"" without being accused of speaking over the movement.

When you're a celebrity, a big ""scandal"" about your private life, like transitioning, can draw media attention away from you being a shitty human being and help you dodge the consequences.

Edit: also when you have that much money and clout you could absolutely say you're going through something difficult and life-changing to avoid prison time. Doesn't work if you're poor though.
Thank you!  I understand your preference is different than mine and tbh if I had transitioned when I was younger I would probably be more in line with your preference.  I'm just at a different point now with different perspective and we need to realize that both of our views are valid for us and all the other perspectives that others have are also valid.
She transitioned started E in 1986. She was among the first famous trans people to do it, and kept it under the radar for 30 years
That, but I also think cis people are presuming trans women are bio identical to cis guys and we just...arent. 

So many cis people don't even know that HRT is a thing, let alone what it does to you.
It's not that simple though. Children shouldn't make life changing decisions at that age.
I'm not an athlete by any stretch but I would do some fitness activities from time to time. I remember that I nearly passed out from trying to keep up with my coworkers about six months into HRT. I used to be about as or more fit than them, and never had problems managing energy before that.
Not aware of any science on this, but kids still play sports during puberty, so if it's more dangerous, it might only be marginally so, perhaps with a few specific pains, but probably no major counter-indication.
 I'll tell you during the next few months/years though :P (competitive badminton player here)
let's ban tall cis women too. The tallest cis woman on record was 7'7 (lol what a man! Sports cheater!) which seems pretty OP to me.
[deleted]
Except that the scientific data *does* point to trans women not having an advantage.

You lose any male athletic advantage when you lose testosterone.

It's anti science to pretend otherwise.

Also ask yourself why is it that the only trans women to even *qualify*  for the Olympics...placed last in their events? How would that be possible if there were such a huge advantage ? 

Hint: it's because we don't actually have one.
""Transphobes like OP"" What? Who said I was transphobic? That's a first 🤦‍♂️
All of the journalists on this story should be fired/sued for harassment and defamation, even if she wasn't a celeb.

I hope Lia is doing alright.

because… the science doesn’t…
Ben Shabooboo🤣🤣🤣
omg you are so right. it wouldn't surprise me if Ben Shapiro trolls this place. He refused to look at the facts I provided, and shyed away from any opportunity to explain how any of his claims were logical. ""it just is because i want it to be"" and explaining why cis people are cis isn't plausible enough for me. Caitlyn Jenner and Blair White like most terfs/trabsphobes are puppets, who feel insecure in some way about themselves about the existence of trans people and everyone else's stance. you'd expect cis people who know nothing to just stay out of the mix, but what surprises me more is when trans people betray their own.

Like how can they want this shit to continue happening to us, and bail on us the moment that they doubt themselves? I guess it's to appeal to the terfs/transphobes who aren't gonna change for us just like we aren't for them. Sometimes i wonder if they even are trans to think being transphobic is in anyway productive. To me, it just makes things worse — making us look bad. I think the only reason why Caitlyn Jenner is as popular as she is for making us look like deceivers. I don't want to say it's bad enough she transitioned at the age of around 65, after ""knowing for decades,"" but that doesn't help her look any better doing this crap.
""transphobes like me""!? how fucking DARE you!? you don't know what my views are, stop insulting people that go against your opinions!?
exactly what I'm saying.
i didn't mean it in that context lmao, just pointing out that that's what a butch lesbian might do
well, she should probably start declining to comment. It's not like she's desperate for money, and this really isn't doing her reputation well. Due to her being so easily-puppeteered to speak such nonsense that goes against facts, she didn't get my vote as governor.
What precisely do you think I was saying in my comment?

As I was apparently unclear, let me clarify: 

1. Caitlyn Jenner didn't transition to dodge manslaughter charges. Being trans doesn't make prosecutors go easy on you. 

2. Yes, she's utterly and irresponsibly wrong about trans women's bodies. No, trans women don't have ""unfair advantages.""
... no, you get the charges dropped via your expensive lawyer finding a plausible pretext. :p ""I was trans the whole time"" is not a get out of jail free card, even if it might distract a tabloid or ten.
That's def true. When I was younger, like an actual child, I'm pretty sure I just thought it was surgery and that's it. I never thought.about hormones or heard anything about it until I was much older and seeking out that information specifically
And that's exactly what puberty blockers are for. Buy time to speak with qualified therapists before your body does something miserable and irreversible to you.
Kids can play sports but they should not be extraneously training (such as for Olympic levels) as it can negatively impact their natural growth
Well, it we take 5'5"" as average for AFAB and 5'9"" for AMAB. Lose two inches (more than average?) for HRT shortening. Then it's 2 inches of advantage on average. So it's 2 inches of ""advantage"" on average.

I don't think that's cause to exclude trans women at all. But let's be realistic about the facts.
[removed]
I think they meant the person asking for the data citation, no OP of this thread. I certainly didn't think you were being transphobic
She’s given hate by the trans community for being racist and transphobic, not for being trans
It’s not a “personal narrative,” it’s an actual thing that actually happened. She rear ended a car, pushing it into oncoming traffic and killing the driver, and the DA did not press charges against her. [Here’s](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-manslaughter-charge-caitlyn-jenner-20150820-story.html) an article from when the crash happened. Someone is dead, it’s her fault, and she faced no repercussions for it.
Did you see the comments where he basically said ""sure trans people are a minority but so are CIS people"" I about died from that. How can you say that cis people, the people who are actively working against us (not all but the broad group i mean) and whom we often fear.. are a fucking minority group, when cis people or rather cis white people dont have to live in fear of losing all their rights.

Also the fact that he tried to call me a ""gatekeeper"" yet also responded to me by saying ""we'll ive been trans longer then most of you, in fact i was trans before it was popular and ive got more karma then you "" like.. as if thats not an attempt at gatekeeping the conversation, also.. like no duh? My accounts only 2 days old lol so ofcourse you'll have more karma then me.

It might be mean to say this, but i doubt that he/the op of that post was even a legit trans person. Like I just dont believe that someone who is trans and has experienced the struggle that we go through... To willingly defend transphobic lies, and disinformation and try to make the trans communities the aggressors and cis people to be the victims... Thats just so.. anti trans that i dont think an actual trans person would do such a thing.

Like after so much science denial, and made up bullshit that one can spout before it becomes obvious they dont actually know what being trans is like. 

Someone even pointed out to them that hormones take a huge toll on a persons body, and explained to them that ""estrogen is just as powerful as testosterone"" because the OP said that of the two hormones estrogen is the weaker one.

Nobody will be able to convince me that he wasnt just a bad faith actor who came here to cause drama and be harm, like how anyone could look at that post and their comments and think they were in good faith is beyond me
The reason is simple. Rather than help us stop the trains to the death camps, they want to make sure they are the absolute last ones put on them. Fuck Jenner and those like her.
Lmao you're the one denyong science here, and sorry anyone who can deny the science of this subject is just a transphobe. Also you're the one going ""trust me bro"" which is a transphobic persons favorite thing to day when the left make claims about subjects regarding trans people
does women with PCOS have an advantage too? they can grow beards after all. your logic:😬
It actually really just depends on several evidence based factors. I didn't think I had to dumb it down for you.

Someone who is still T-dominant, whether male or female, has normal or high male hormonal levels, and completed puberty shouldn't compete with women and girls just like cis women on steroids can't. That's why it's laughable that so many ""wannabe experts"" overlook this detail: Testosterone is a steroid when preferring to put women against transgender MALES (female to male).

This is a fact any level-headed trans person like me cannot argue with. Vice versa for E-dominance and competing with men. 

That creates the advantage, so I guess we're not as dumb as previously just assumed. 

If society does what the terfs want, trans men will probably be not allowed to compete at all since many of us are even stronger than the cis men in our age division and trans women wouldn't be able to overpower the upper body strength of men. I'm explaining to you what I already did a hour ago. You ignored it because it was too long, scientific, and technical.

Lia looks like she is within her first 5 years of estrogen. Don't let the bone changes of T-poisoning confuse you. Her muscle mass looks female to me, compaired to my veiny, bulging ones. Her face looks soft and estrogenic too so I have no doubt she's on Estrogen.

If she's been on hormonal blockers since she was a  pre-teen, or has been on estrogen for years, again — NO proven advantages unless she has Eddie Hall's rare condition. He's the world's strongest man, whose muscles do not atrophy or have a stopping point, which his daughter also inherited — giving them hulk-like physiques with little effort due to the rare condition, causing what I described: myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. That or steroids would be the only advantage against cisgender women, NOT estrogen you dunce. 🤣🤣🥵

I hope Eddie Hall's cisgender daughter isn't disqualified over her ""advantage""
Haha thank you for clarifying. I was 50/50 on which way you meant it and so decided to just not respond.

I'm not butch but in regards to the lesbian stereotype... if the Doc Martens fits 🤷‍♀️
my bad i thought you were taking up for Caitlyn
Delay puberty till you're 18 years old? Seems unlikely.
Yeah, I'm only speaking of competition at, say, regional level ? I was not speaking about people who specifically train to be world-class in their sport - sorry for the misunderstanding
[deleted]
""Tower over the girls"" LMAO!!! 

Dude..im 5'7"" and a trans woman, and not even the tallest woman on my basketball team.

Shit, I've had a cis woman teammate who is like twice my size. I'm a really *tiny* skinny little thing. Despite what you seem to think, we don't all look like she hulk, and it is more than possible for cis women to be bigger and taller than us.

Shit, Michelle Obama, Melania Trump, and Sigourney weaver are all 4 inches taller than me. They are all cis.

And yeah you actually *do* lose all male athletic ability. Shit, my boyfriend can pin me to the ground just by laying his foot on top of me, and I can't open jars anymore without help. 

And again, if there was such a magic 15% difference how is it possible that I am in the *lower* average for my run times for women in my age bracket? Shouldn't it be higher than that? 

And what records? Cite your sources here. Not a single trans woman has ever so much as medaled at the Olympics despite being eligible for 20 years now.

And YouTube propaganda videos are not a credible source imo.
I didn't. he deleted literally everything after refusing to read the facts we gave him, just like something ben shapiro would do.

i found pics of him ""pre."" Even ""pre"" dude looks like a cis guy to me who grew out a patchy beard for the past 8 years. it wouldn't surprise me if he is, since part of the post seemed like a massive slap in the face  of any real trans person. I'm surprised I haven't seen the guy troll r/ftm, if he's even heard of that sub.

he didn't care about the argument i had that supports him either, so if he's truly trans, this guy either has a screw loose or hates himself like the other trans transphobes. 

He couldn't even give me an unbiased, science based source that proves ""no matter how long"" we take HRT since it's been clinically proven.
First of all this conversation is finished, Secondly you misunderstood  completely the ""trust me bro"". I wasn't telling them to trust me, it was an ironic way of saying that the redditor I was answering had no proof of whatever he was trying to say.
I don't know, do PCOS women grow significantly taller than other women and have significantly more muscle mass? If so, yes they would have advantage. Your logic: ""I want to bend reality because I can't accept biology""
Nah, I'm a trans woman who transitioned a couple years before Caitlyn did, I hate her guts :p I was just pushing back on the idea that being trans is a way to get out of legal trouble
Sometimes puberty delays itself. Your unscientific beliefs probably ignore intersex people altogether, doesn't it? Often times, transgender people are. This could mean the chromosomes are indecisive, mixmatched, they exhibit deemed ""male"" and ""female"" genitals, or the brain fully developed as another gender. Delayed puberty is usually how people find out that they are intersex. More studies may find being trans begins as an intersexuality, since people assigned so at birth have to have the same types of procedures as transgender people, for the same cause — gender dysphoria and various gender identities. The only one who knows them best is God and themselves. Not you. Not some other trans person. Just God and them. People calling Lia a man is sickening for this reason, when she's well aware that she's a woman. Don't like it? Cry and get over it. Why worry? She isn't hurting you is she? :)
Eighteen isn't a magic number, people aren't finished developing until 25 anyway. The point is that the adults can, with more experience than a child, guide that child to ask questions that will make clear what choice is right for them. People don't ""suddenly change"" when they hit 18, all the adults in their lives just failed to properly listen to them until they finally had the autonomy to be themselves.
Yeah that kind of sport is usually fine

Serious injuries at a young age can heal wrong quite easily (I guess apart of healing fast) and they’ve not got the durability of adults

And contact sports that hit the damage can cause micro fissures and lead to brain damage - especially on a brain that’s not finished developing 

Dumb that high school kids play American football
Is the average trans woman taller than the average cis woman? Yes.

Should that difference disqualify them from competition? No.

It's important for us to be honest with ourselves and everyone else. Not deny facts. But still assert that trans women should have every right to participate in these and other sports as women.

I'm worried when people say things like you're saying, where you're trying to say something unrelated ""genetic lottery has far more to do with it"" without addressing head on that sometimes 2 inches difference is what makes the difference between being 5'11"" and uncompetitive and 6'1"" and competitive.

I think a better way to say this is ... women with better early childhood nutrition are on average taller as well. Would you block women with better early childhood nutrition from competition as well? No, you wouldn't, all women should be able to participate.
Don't waste time arguing with transphobes, it'll only drag down your mental health. If they were going to be receptive to facts and science, they wouldn't be here.
Your being a mediocre athlete is irrelevant and brings nothing to the table.
The only ""science"" based thing he tried to use against me was that trans women are ""taller"" then cis women, and that they would weigh differently then cis women... As if thats at all science and reasonable.

Like at that point with those idiotic suggestions, you'd also be saying then cis people who are over 6 ft tall cant compete with people who are less then 6ft tall, or people who weigh 250 pounds couldnt compete with people who weighed 200 pounds because the weight/height difference would be some sort of major advantage... Like height and weight isnt a ""trans"" thing, its a human thing everyone of any gender will come in different heights and weights.. like there are cis women who are legit 7ft tall, and cis men who are only 4ft tall .
Except you're the one who was making claims that trans people have an significant advantage when it comes to sports.. when they scientifically dont and have been shown to actually have a disadvantage. 

And no you werent being ironic, denying science isnt ""being ironic"" it's being a science denying transphobe as you're spouting anti trans dialogue by saying that trans people have an advantage in sports when science doesnt agree with that and actually states the latter.

Sorry, but anyone who denies science and spouts right leaning, disinformation lies like ""trans people having an advantage in sports"" is a transphobe in my book.
can you tell me facts, not stereotypes? the average man is 5'9, I bet most of Lia's team are somewhere around there. Idk, she doesn't look drastically taller or more muscular to me. Maybe in the thighs since women carry their strength there on estrogen. Can't you read? I said this already. I'm gonna block you if I have to keep repeating myself. I gave you experts' debunking. What else do you want?

Statistics? Ok, women can be any height, dude. the tallest is cisgender and 7'7. the tallest trans woman is like a  FOOT shorter (6'8) hahaha. Both are gorgeous feminine looking women who would astonish anyone looking for a model. This is from genetics, not testosterone. 

I may not have had efficient T at birth, but I am taller than 90% of the cis guys I encounter since I am talker than 5'9. I was 5'9 at the age of 14. My mom is 5'6, 2"" over 5'4 and she's cis. Some just are taller. There is only a 5"" size gap between male and female so where I am 6'1.5 to be exact, is the height I'm supposed to be.

Some women can have more muscle mass than some men and not be trans, just athletic with a high metabolism. Some may be hormonally imbalanced (PCOS) like I said, or have other conditions like thyroid conditions or the Eddie Hall one I mentioned. Anyways, like I said, I don't like repeating myself so I am going to block you now. Maybe in the next life, you'll figure it out when you find God gave you the same brain and the default (rather than female) body. Would you fake a smile and learn to accept that, which only ever ends up causing regret, depression, eating disorders, anxiety, anger, frustration, and jealousy like Cait's probably feeling for faking being a guy for quite a while mainly due to society holding her back at the time, way post the effects of testosterone on her peak bone mass and her voice (it's never too late, but it gets harder to see yourself and for others to see you and take you seriously)

Living in the closet, you'll have everyone telling tou how to be that gender assigned at birth, but you fail for years at feeling content, not looking awkward around others, or hiding the obvious fact that you'd be wearing a mask — like someone trying to learn a language.


Even if you're good looking either way, you can be trans. It's not about looks or insecurity about looks or how you sound. It's a subconscious preference you'd hate yourself for ever ignoring, like your sexuality - whether asexual, hetero, homo or bi

And bi rhymes with bye now😘👍😬
[removed]
oh, but it does, because it disproves that we have an inherent advantage. If we did, how would it be \*possible\* for me to be a mediocre athlete by women's standards?

The fact that I exist, disproves your basic premise.
Didn't you read me saying that this conversation was over? byeeee
I'm glad we can agree on one thing. Intersexuality isn't a sexuality, just like the terms used for trans and cis ending in -sexuality. It's just the state of someone's sex rather than gender; these are two different things, which can be used interchangibly. People who wish to undergo a full sex change may identify as ""transsexual"" and since not all transgender people do, many do not use this term and may even find it offensive when labelled that. 

Many people still think trans = gay.
Just no.
It's basic math, man. ON AVARAGE men are stronger. That doesn't mean that ALL men are stronger than ALL of women. The real, dramatic difference in power is most evident when people are trying to optimize themselves to be the best athlete they can, and they dedicate their life for it. Starting with even a 10/15% advantage in that context is HUGE.
Ah yes the famous, transphobe runs away when they've been proven wrong lmao
key word there is \*men\*. Men perform that way because of \*testosterone\*, you know, the exact thing we make a point of getting rid of, and replacing with estrogen.

Fact of the matter is we are \*not\* men, and our bodies do not \*perform\* like men's bodies, because we make a \*point\* of feminizing our bodies. That's kind of what transition \*is\*.

You're trying to cite a group of people that we are not, that have athletic enhancing hormones we don't have, to argue that we can do athletically what they can. In what universe is that remotely a logical argument?

Moreover, since when is having a biological advantage a disqualification for sports anyways? You don't see people banning tall people from the NBA for having an advantage or Michael Phelps being banned from swimming despite having several genetic abnormalities that make him better suited for swimming.

the reality is the entire \*concept\* of sports revolves around biological advantages, and there's no real way around that.

Even if we \*did\* have an advantage (which we don't), people get ahead in sports because of biological advantages all the time and nobody cares. So why do they care with us? Because it's all about being transphobic.

Nobody gives a flying fuck if a cis woman happens to be a she hulk of a woman that what were your words ""towers above the other girls"", but suddenly if we are it's a huge issue? Come on man, just admit it you're transphobic, and the \*only\* reason you're making this argument is because of anti trans bigotry. If a cis woman had the \*exact same\* advantages you're bitching about I guarantee I wouldn't hear a peep out of you.
Girl, are you really thay oblivious? I'm not gonna talk with someone that offends me repeatedly,  tf, get lost."	seopja	trans	733	0.96	2022-01-28 11:29:40
I hate her so much	My therapist, I recently just stopped working with her. Because of how horrible she treated me, and targeted me because I am transgender. But I went to look at reviews for her, but now she has on her profile how she works with trans people. And is very affirming and supporting (which is a lie.) I’ve never seen this on her profiles before, this is completely new. I am just so mad and sad at the same time.	"Leave a bad review if you can. Really sorry you were mistreated.
Absolutley scared of turfs like these. they are just leeches on my trust and desire for help.  


You'll find someone. Don't stop feelin good because of one amoral agenda pushing jerk.  


Sendin Love 🤗😘😘
My therapist gave up when I wasn't an easy patient anymore. I worked on my bipolar with her for years and I was stable. As soon as I mentioned gender dysphoria she got uncomfortable and asked me to find a new therapist. That was very hard and there was a therapist that I saw that was bad as well. Glad I kept looking because I found the perfect therapist for me.
What did she that was horrible for you ?
I’m so glad I never had to see a therapist before starting talking to some random about my problems isnt for me
If you don’t mind me asking, what did she do that was horrible?
Same thing happened to me a while back. She kept trying to coerce me away from transition (she won because I've given up any hope of it). You're better off without a therapist like that. The positive reviews might be faked, to be honest, uhless the site verifies identities
Get another therapist. She sounds like a wannabe. She’s definitely mistreating you by the words she’s using.
Sorry
I'm so sorry you had this experience. Please report her if you can, and I hope you find a better therapist soon!
I can’t on my main, but I prob will under a throw away or something.
I really hope that you aren't too angry at that therapist still. Therapists have different areas that they focus on and specialize in. She might have been excellent with your bipolar disorder but not having any experience with gender issues so telling you that she's not the one to help guide you through that was very professional of her IMHO. It meant losing you as her client but she's the one that knows the limitations of her knowledge and expertise and she probably saw that you would not be properly served by her at this point. 

I had something not entirely different happen recently. Back in January, I decided that I needed to change therapists so I went back and started looking. I found someone that sounded like a good fit but the first appointment I could get was in April. Meanwhile, I'm going out of my mind with anxiety issues on top of trying to get help transitioning and I find out that my workplace has an employee assistance program that will pay for 10 therapy sessions through a telemedicine service. It's free, I got nothing to lose so I sign up saying thar I'm having issues with anxiety and some other stuff. 

A couple week or so later, I started HRT and my anxiety is just gone. Poof. Overnight practically. 

Get the session with the EAP therapist. Explain that I'd be more than happy to talk about my nonexistent anxiety issues with her. She's taken aback and I go into some detail with my story and that I'm still looking for help with gender and sexuality issues that are present and she tells me that she's very much a specialist in anxiety and really doesn't have experience in the topics that I'm looking for help with at the moment. I thanked her for her time and her honesty with me and we ended the call about 30 mins early.
Bunch of stuff, one is that she looked me dead in the eyes and told me I will never be a man.

“She won because I’ve given up any hope of it”

This statement hits a bit close to home, so I feel I should remind you that you deserve hope as well! Even if you’ve had a particularly horrible experience with therapy, please try your best to keep an open mind towards your own happiness and remember that anyone worth a dang will support you to achieve it! As hard as it is to stay positive sometimes, nobody deserves to have their hopes stripped from them because of the ignorance of others, you, all of us, owe it to ourselves to keep moving ahead as best we can! Sometimes that’s therapy and sometimes it’s just goofing around on trans subreddits, but it’s important to keep hope alive in whatever way works best, right?
I wonder if she can just delete bad reviews, is it on her website or something like Facebook? It’s obviously not going to be Tripadviser, maybe there should be a therapy advisor site for honest reviews that can’t just be hidden
Thank you so much for your comment


I'm not mad at her, I appreciate her telling me that she wasn't best equipped for my issues. 
I did feel betrayed at the time because she was the first person I ever talked to about my gender dysphoria. But in hindsight I'm so glad that I could find a new therapist.

She was the only therapist I'd ever had so I didn't know if she was good or not, but my new therapist is also way better with my bipolar too. The first one was a lot older and not up to date with the latest research (literally pulled out the DSM5 and said maybe I'm a transsexual or a crossdresser). My current therpist is much more engaging  which is a super important trait, and reads research between sessions. She also recommends papers for me to read because I'm very academicly minded.
How did you felt hearing her saying that ?
It’s on one of those therapist finder websites.
Really glad to hear that things are working better with your new therapist and that you appreciate her for being honest with you! It may have taken some time for that and that's also understandable, especially since you'd been working with her for a long time on your bipolar."	u8fh2d	trans	696	0.98	2022-04-21 04:42:59
my kid made me sad	"We where playing around with the faceapp as I have said in previous posts he's 5 and doesn't know I'm trans Me as a girl, long hair, ext and he just said he likes me as I am. Misses my heard and shorter hair.

Starting to fear my ex wife is right that he will not be able to deal with me coming out. Just made me want to cry


Edit:
Thank you everyone for your kindness. Had a rough few days emotionally and you've all helped so much. I feel so loved and happy for our community

Edit 2:
Swear my kids trolling me 🤣 he now wants to have hair like mine...that's my other worry to much imitation. Thank you all like I said been extra emotional lately and feeling isolated and not who I want to be having to hide"	"Ok so. Hi ! I came out to my son when he was exactly the same age as yours today. Now he’s 8 and he’s my best ally. Kids are clever and don’t have preconceived ideas on gender issues. Now he’s the one getting mad at my ex and her family when they deadname/misgender me.
The opposite it true. Simply tell him you realized you were a girl and you are wearing long hair and dresses now. He has two moms who love him very very much and that your name is —— now but he can call you “mamaw”. (Or whatever word you decide)

He will accept it quickly and with a hug. 

Children don’t know how to reject love.
My gf’s son knew me before transitioning. He’s 4, almost five. Every time I’ve cut my hair or dyed it he’s taken it oddly. Tells me to change it back/doesn’t like it. But eventually he ends up loving my new style and look. Kids process change a little more bluntly especially when they don’t fully know the reason why. 

When I asked him to call me by my chosen name, I told him he can call me Moss and the entire night we cooked things while calling me moss. Every time he said my deadname, I said “you can call me moss” as if it was a special name. Lately he asked me what my old name was, so he does remember. But I just said it’s ok because I don’t use it anymore and eventually he got distracted by another toy. 

When he doesn’t like the change I have, I’m now growing a mustache and etc, I just tell him that it’s something I like. And eventually he accepts it.
MtF trans Mom here and I was hoping to give you some advice. Tear the bandaid off and tell him when you feel ready. But respect his emotions and his perspectives when I came out, my son was not accepting and he was 4-5 at the time. He constantly insisted he hated when ""daddy"" wore dressed or put on makeup. He hated that daddy was a girl and for several weeks it broke me to see him that way. I generally considered going back into the closet... But instead of giving up I continued to assure him I was still me, I still loved him, and i kept talking and playing with him like I always would. I would explain how I used to be so sad and being a girl made me happy etc. I was open and honest with him deciding to not keep secrets. I explained the best ways I could the truth about my feelings and happiness as I could to a child his age. Finally, my son opened up to what bothered him with me being a girl. He was scared that he had to be a girl one day... He thought because his daddy had decided she didn't like being a boy, that meant he also had to be a girl eventually... After explaining that wasn't how this worked, that he was who he wants to be he did a full 180. He compliments my outfits and makeup, he even calls me Mom. Once I found the source of his issues with my transition and addressed them to disperse his concerns he's become incredibly supportive. Your son is young, but he is smarter than you realize.
Kids are really receptive. Just because he misses your beard doesn’t mean much :) maybe it’s just a sensory thing. It might take some time, but it’s certainly better to do it sooner rather than later <3
My son is 6, and i have started to ask him his opinion of my skirts and tops so he feels some measure of involvement. I don't always follow his advice, as he is 6 and will mix stripes and plaids all day long, but then, he doesn't always accept my advice on his outfits, which i let him pick out on weekends(because he will always go for the loudest combination ever😆). He just wants to put his 2 cents in and feel heard. That is his age, and the recent divorce. Giving him little choices to make, and asking his opinion about things has done a lot for him.
He is five, I am not a parent, but I am an older sibling by a significant amount; five-year-old are really smart, but not always really aware; it would have broken his heart to know that he made you feel upset by him saying that. 

He will love you, no matter what. Maybe talk to him some and see if you can help him understand.
He's only five, it can sometimes take a few goes at explaining things to kids before they really get it. My son is 4 and I've been out as a trans man for almost 3 years, he still calls me mummy, especially around my ex. Most of the time he calls me by my name, and generally uses he/him pronouns (he does get pronouns all mixed up though, and typically defaults to he/him) once he's older I'll tell him what being trans means, but for now I'm just *my name*/mummy to him and that's okay

It's especially going to be hard if you haven't told him that you're a woman and that you're changing you name and what you want him to call you. Kids generally don't like it when a parent makes a big change, like going from having a beard and shorter hair to no beard and growing your hair out, it takes time but I'm sure soon it'll be the new normal for him. And once he knows the situation it should get easier. 

Be kind to yourself, and take care. Your son loves you and knows you love him,and that's what matters
New parent here so I don’t much experience to weigh in with but just want to remind you of the big picture: 

living your truth and loving yourself will, not only allow you to better show up for your family, but will also show your kid just how important that all is. 

Im so sorry for your experience today, that must really hurt. Sending you love 💕

Edit: also, kids are resilient and you are so much more than a beard.
I came out when my son was three. He's five now and sometimes tells me he wants me to turn back into mommy again. It hurts, but I know he doesn't mean anything negative by it. He just remembers a different me sometimes and likes to relive those memories. I know when he's older it will be easier for him to understand. Outside of that there has been no fuss, no sign that he can't deal with me being Dad, nothing. He's been my rock. He and my husband both.

Kids are perceptive. I don't know your kid or your situation but your son might surprise you.
he possibly just needs some time to get used to the real you! 
kids are so accepting if brought up right. As long as his mother isn't preaching hate then I'm sure he will love you for you and if ur ex is teaching him to hate then have a serious talk with her!
My ex said the exact same thing before I came out, that they couldn't handle it, but she was absolutely wrong. 

The change was hard initially for both of my kids, who were 10 and 4 when I came out and my ex and I separated. They struggled for different reasons, and it was really hard having them echo stuff from my ex. But they eventually recognized just how much happier I was being myself and emotionally available after starting to transition. My 4 yr old came around much faster than my 10 yr old, but both have come around. 


There are a ton of great childrens books for exploring this subject and asking why he feels that way could be very insightful.
Hey! Hope this helps, I’m not a parent - but my little brother in law (10) is literally watching me transition from female to male (living with partners Dad as homing crisis) 

When I arrived, I had long blonde hair down to my butt. That’s all he’s ever known me as. Within a month of arriving, it has been cut to “boy” length. At first, he didn’t like it. It was too different for him. But as time went on, he adjusted. He now knows me as having short hair & he doesn’t even bat an eyelid when I get it cut every few months. 

My girlfriend just got prescription glasses yesterday- and he told her he doesn’t like them 🤣 once again, because it’s different. But he’ll adjust, just as your baby will too. Some kids just don’t like change ❤️ 

(Also spoken from someone who is on the spectrum)
My youngest kid is 8 and though she didn't fully understand when I came out, she understands I'm happier and in general more fun and connected to her now. It's definitely been a learning process though. She explained one day ""it's kinda confusing at school cause I tell my friends I have a dad and a mom but then you went to my school and it just 2 moms "" and I was just like"" why don't you just tell your friends you have 2 moms then it's not confusing?"" To which she replied ""oh.. i hadn't even thought of that"" lol 

I guarantee your kid will come around and enjoy you being in their life as their authentic life. Kids have very flexible minds, but just be prepared cause mine have definitely triggered my dysphoria in the past cause kids say what is on their mind with no filter. But they mean well and definitely will still love you.
I wish I had come out when my kids were younger. I did it when my son was 18 and my daughter was 15 and it was not pleasant, my son got upset and even refused to speak to me whenever I went girl mode. Luckily my daughter was the opposite and now we go shopping together. It’s been a year now and my son is slowly coming around but it’s still not fun at times. I think some of the commenters were right, better when they’re younger.
He's 5. When I was 8 and my brother 5 our mom got a perm. We *hated* it. Wanted our old mom back. Because she styled her hair differently. Kids are weird. Super plastic in some ways super rigid in others. (Ever try to take away a kid's security blanket?) I wouldn't interpret too much from what a 5 year old can conceptualize.
He’ll get used to it. My nieces and nephews have. It’s almost like they forgot I was born a boy
Honestly from what I've seen, kids are the most accepting & understanding of this stuff - way more than most adults. It might take some time but chances are he'll come around to the change.
It's just a kid, kids learn what you teach them just be good to him and explain him everything and never Dodge his question and it'll be all good
I totally get you. In a complicated scenario, my parents ended up winning custody of my kid due the ex wife being a POS and me being broke. I am not allowed to come out to him, but they have allowed everything in video calls except makeup. My son is a little worried his daddy is turning into a girl, as he has seen my clothes and body shape changes, along either the hair, but my family keeps shutting me out of fully telling him. 

It is fucking crippling and I totally get your pain or sadness
honestly at 5 that's like the easiest time for a kid to adapt to that...if you waited you run the risk of also making them feel like it's their fault you waited (similar to waiting to divorce until a kid is later teen or early adult, when they think more about these things and are dealing with their own insecurity and need a lot of support themselves).
Kids desperatly want to love their parents, even if they are terrible or abuse them they try to rationalize that their parents are good people. He night be a little bit confused when you tell him, but heck.. I think he'll be just fine
i thought it was weird when my dad grew a beard and then i got used to it 🤷🏼 this seems like a similar level of concern. i wouldn’t worry too much about that—change is always uncertain for young kids.
I can’t remember the name of the short film, but it follows a trans woman and her daughter as she goes through her transition. At first the daughter had trouble adjusting to calling her mother “mom” but at the end of the film and the daughter grew older the daughter was wonderfully supportive.
I think it won't be a big deal. But you should probably get your kid a therapist who is specialised in gender issues to help him process it step by step.
Children are complicated, and also they could be influenced by school friends opinions. When I was 5 I couldn't understand gender that much. I mean I thought I was just like my male friends but identified as a girl because that was my assigned at birth gender, but at the same time I asked people to call me Roderick. Lol. Time made me understand life is a mess, binaries are not for anyone, and things change, it's normal and acceptable.
Kids are SO easy on this. They haven't learned all the biases and shit that adults have. I bet you're going to find this is MUCH easier than you think it is. I genuinely think you should tell him sooner, rather than later, or at least start talking about trans people in a general sense. I bet you absolutely anything that he's just like oh yeah, that's cool, okay. Good luck :)
I’m MtF and told my 5 year old just a couple of weeks ago. I agonized for months, terrified that he would be upset or unable to accept me… now he calls me mom when he remembers. Kids don’t judge like we do
Honnestly? Kids can be the most open minded people out there and they can be really inquisitive and willing to learn new things.
Don't worry about it too much. Give him some time and he will learn to deal with it and he will get used to it. 
He is able to deal with it and he will. He might just need some time understanding what's happening with you.
Take some time to talk to him about it maybe get some pro trans children books. They exist and will help him learn about being trans in an appropriate way.

Edit: needed to bonk some typos
Kids hate changes of any kind in their home situation. They don't understand it and don't know what adjusting is yet. It has nothing to do with malice towards anyone and everything with the world being foreign and confusing and scary. He doesn't understand the situation and that's scary to him, I'm sure he'll be fine as soon as he gets used to it. His apparent rejection doesn't mean he loves you any less, he's just scared of change. Assuring him you're still his parent, that you love him and you'll always be there for him should help
Try to focus on your own axis, the more you are aware of who you truly are deep inside, the more the kid will come to accept it later. Just give him time, dear.
I completely understand your fear.  A big thing holding back my transition was my kid!!  I was so afraid of what he would think of me as he grew.  I started when he was two.  I'm mtf btw.  He doesn't care in the slightest.  He still calls me daddy lol which isn't a huge deal personally cause it's my child, it's only awkward in public.  I'm like yeah daddy isn't here right now 😅😅 but we're working on it.

My therapist comforted me by saying as long as you give your child love and are there for them they won't care who or what you are.  They just need love guidance and acceptance 💜💜💜 I'm sure it will be just fine 🙂
I just moved in with my boyfriend and his family and when i first met his baby sister she was 3 and i wasn’t out yet and she saw me as a boy. when i came back and was transitioning (mtf) she didn’t say anything at all and her mom told her i’m a girl and she has no problem using my pronouns and never refers to me as a boy, even on days i forget to save haha
My kid's 10. I began transitioning when she was 8, and she's totally on board.
Whoa
👍
My niece was around 2 when i started transitioning. I was also a big part of helping to raise her. What it took was everyone else calling me by my chosen name and he/him pronouns. Overtime she got used to it and now, she's 5, turning 6 this year, and very accepting of people who are trans. Im into my hero academia so when i was drawing with her, i was drawing magne, whom is a trans woman canonically. She has a bit of facial hair so my niece questioned it, saying no thats a guy he has a beard. I said women can have beards too. And explained that she is still a woman even with a beard. It made sense to her and ever since then she doesnt have as much gender stereotypes in her head. Though im sure now that shes in kindergarten and being raised by a mom who thinks makeup is the only thing thst redeems her and makes her beautiful, and a dad who is a redneck and highly uncomfortable (he still calls me by my deadname and wrong pronouns even when everyone else doesnt) by trans people. She might grow up being put back into the mindset that theres only binary genders, but i certainly hope that wont be the case and i was able to bring her to understand trans people. I hope her memory of me sticks around and keeps her open-minded
Your being dumb. kids just deal with stuff especially over long periods of time. Literally the only thing you don't need to worry about with transition is the kids.
Oh my conservatism. Living in Russia, I was hooked by the fact that I cannot accept transgender people who have children as transgender people. In any case, this was one of the reasons why I refuse and will never accept myself as a transgender girl, only as a girl and nothing else.  
  
I don't know if hell is to blame or not. Truth or not is on my side. Propaganda of conservatism is possible. I absolutely don't know. Before, my attitude was simply that it doesn't matter. The main thing is that it does not concern me.
[removed]
Teach him about transness when he’s young. Show him that it’s completely normal and beautiful.
I'm sure once he gets older he will understand and accept you
Maybe he's been complaining about the beard since January. I hope just afraid now
I have a neice, she's young enough that it would be cool for her to get to know me just as Emma. But her parents are likely to feel the need to explain how wrong my life is and such. And I couldn't be stealthy enough to convince them to just have her not need to know my past. At least not for a long time.

The other side of their famy is also not supportive, so my neice would definitely have to confront things at some point. Makes things a touch complicated.
I hope your right. Supposed to wait until we get him a counselor though
This is very wholesome
I know we just sat there watching tv with my the kids (others 1.5) crying a little then getting under control he didn't notice.
No more worried about her extended family religious conservative don't speak the name of the nephew that was gay ext
Also your ex wife is a manipulative jerk.  My ex said the same shit to me which didn't help with me accepting that I was trans.  I was in a very dark place for quite some time.
I'm not sure that ""you're (sic) being dumb"" is very helpful in this situation. :|
Trolls validate me with there very existence
My kid didn't like when I lost my beard, either. Took them some time to get used to it. They are college aged.

But, yeah, original commenter is right. Kids are very open and have no preconceived notions on what most anything is, let alone gender. Unless your ex is pumping his little head full of bad ideas, I'm sure there will be no problems with him accepting you as yourself.
It’s prob nothing big when I was young I liked playing with my dads beard and got mad when he shaved it 😂
It's just because he was familiar with it. You can come out to him and explain, he might nit be abpe to understand at first, but if you explain things and say that ""you are happy and having fun"" he might be able to understand.

You have to remember that he is a kid and you have to say things in a way that he can understand or relate. He knows the concept of fun and happiness very well, so he will relate to that. Find things that he likes and help him understand you this way :3
Little anecdote about facial hair... when I was 5-ish, I heard my uncle downstairs and ran down to see him, only to be confronted by a weird, mustache-less dude in my living room. I screamed and ran away until he called out to me and I realized who he was.

It could be he's just used to the beard and needs time to recognize you. Keeping my fingers crossed for a happy outcome!
Why's that?
The Ex wants him to have a support network in place,  we have the divorce and my transition. He also has some anger issues.

Been a few issues with getting one so far among them our argument about what is and isn't trans friendly (she thinks trans supportive counselor will say he's bad for not accepting me ext 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️)
Well she's absolutely right to make sure he has a support network, especially right now with a divorce and his anger problems already apparent.

Are you specifically wanting a trans support therapist? I'm guessing for a kid a family therapist is the best bet as they deal with everything going on in a child's life.
As long as they don't try to tell him I'm evil or bad I don't worry to much"	tlcaub	trans	684	0.99	2022-03-23 20:15:09

I saw it in kohls one day and loved it. But I couldnt afford it at the time. A few months passed and I was looking everywhere for it! Finally ended up finding one last one available on ebay of all places! It is one of my oldest dresses but definitely a favorite! 😁
Thank you!

2243 days. Or 6 years, 1 month x3

Thank you!! It says ""I love you so much"" in pink, and the words behind it are ""I don't want anything bad to happen to you, I'm sad but I smile and that's my life""
Thank youuu, I do however feel I look much better with an eyeliner filter, but I made my hair look nice today for my ""date"" with my fwb and tried a cute outfit so I felt nice today😊
On Shein, however there's only sizes L and XL available now and it probably won't restock on smaller sizes, it's from a clothing company called romwe though, I love their clothing style so the pants are also theirs

My mom said she’s sad for the girls “I will meet”	"Yep. This is exactly what you read.

For some background information we were walking through the city and talking about my gender. She at one point just straight out said this:
“I feel very sorry for the future girls that will not get to date you. You are such a good young man, girls love boys like you”. 
What the fuck. I told her it was very patriarchic and misogynistic and that I didn’t expect her to think that stuff. What makes matters worse is that she’s atheist so it’s not like she was taught that by The Church.

Im probably not even into girls (still figuring that one out) so my gender doesn’t matter either way, but hey any excuse to be transphobic is good.

Not really sth big, just wanted to share this event with you.

Dominika, 15"	"""Girls love boys like you"" im a lesbian 😂
She doesn’t have to saddle you with her regrets. Live your own life.
Trust me, transphobia doesn’t come from religion, being an atheist doesn’t really change much
You should have told her when it comes to women, it’s quality over quantity that matters. Who cares if it’ll be harder to find an accepting GF? That just means that the ones that are willing to date you are both attracted to you, not ashamed of you, and love you for your personality.
[removed]
“You are such a good young man, girls love boys like you.”
… ma’am unfortunately your son isn’t attracted to women.

your son also isn’t your son—
Pssst, transbians are a thing tell a friend
I love your name, Dominika!  My mother's name is Monika.  K is so much better than C in these contexts.
as we all know, lesbians and bisexual women do not exist
I would reply ""so... Girls love girls then? Not sure what you mean ""boys like me""""

Just play dumb as if you were cis and that transphobia didn't make any sense (because realistically, it doesn't)
Yes, pretending to be a man to get a date is a healthy strategy. /s
Your mother is an interesting specimen
Ugh I’m sorry you had to hear this from your mum. You deserve better.

Why is she showing more concern for some hypothetical women than for her child? That’s super gross.
Lesbians don't exist apparently
Really? Rather than being happy for you, she’s sad for people she will never meet. As a parent I just wanna smack her with my purse.
Her quote could literally be said to anyone, I don’t understand why she’s so limited in her thinking
Exactly, religion is just used as a mouth piece to push transphobic ideas
aaaa ftw

Sometimes, this is what a girl looks like. Exhausted and sad and masc. Being trans is hard, and it's okay to not be okay. You are trans and you are badass and you are valid.		"I get that on a very personal level, keep fighting the good fight.
I feel that just had a breakdown about an hour ago.

Let's take a moment to think about each trans and nonbinary life that was taken since the last Trans day of remembrance in the US. I have a list of their names below	"This is no longer just the US, but I've added people worldwide who've died from homicide and suicide and I am willing to add more anyone else finds. I apologize that I cannot change my title to reflect it is worldwide, but...

To each of you brave souls who came out and lived your true self despite the risks involved, you will not be forgotten 💙💗🤍💗💙

The following are homicide victims, known from the Human Rights Campaign from the United States, links below.

Martina Caldera, Tiffany Banks, Semaj Billingslea, Acey Morrison, Mya Allen, Dede Ricks, Maddie Hofmann, Aaron Lynch, Kandii Reed, Hayden Davis, Marisela Castro, Cherry Bush, Keshia Chanel Geter, Martasia Richmond, Kitty Monroe, Shawmaynè Giselle Marie, Brazil Johnson, Sasha Mason, Chanelika Y'Ella Dior Hemingway, Nedra Sequence Morris, Ray Muscat, Fern Feather, Ariyanna Mitchell, Miia Love Parker, Kenyatta ‘Kesha” Webster, Kathryn “Katie” Newhouse, Tatiana Labelle, Paloma Vazquez, Naomie Skinner, Cypress Ramos, Duval Princess, Amariey Lej

The following homicide victims are known from Trans Respect and are names of trans people killed worldwide, including a few from the USA that were missed from the HRC(I didn't include any duplicates which both HRC and Trans Respect found, as they are above and were in my original post, but their names are otherwise in order of how they appear in the Trans Respect pdf, over the past year)

These lists may be incomplete and if anyone knows of any others, I would love to respect their life as well and add them on. I do apologize that this may be an incomplete list.

Another redditor pointed out that suicide victims should be remembered as well, and I totally agreed. It is sad to see these people no longer with us, but here is, what is most likely, an incomplete worldwide list of trans suicide victims from this past year and I thought they deserve to be remembered as well.

Chocolatito Anzorra, Serena Brenneman, Alex Bastien, Luise Fernandes Cazé, Ingram Gordon, Monicalorenzi Lorenzi, Valis Ortiz, Taylor, Cloe Bianco, Sasha, Rexy Que, Alice Litman, Danna Nunes, Maddie Dickens, Sherin Celine Mathew, Ruby Taverner, Asher Garcia, Kenna Leigh Gillock, Felis Joy, Amani Frieden, Ezra Amos, Marcela Gomes Fonseca, Mirza-Hélène Deneuve (“Julles”). Kai Khan, Quinn Mowrer Gustin, Celene Gabriela Colantino (“Nati”), Paulo Vaz (“Popo Vaz”), Milo Winslow, Gwenn Agathe Linski, Adrien Baptiste Luckas, Iggy Rose, Destinee Lashaee, Shay Patten Walker, Nicoly, Hanar, Zirve Soylu, Babalu Vendraminy, Emma Boland, Gael Pandino, Kauê Vestemberg, Blair Envy, Amelia Furniss Leonhart, Haley Gabriella Feldman, Joey Spencer(“JoJo”), Tal Pitterbraut-Merx, Tayda Lebón, Zehava, Karol Souza, as well as 6 unidentified victims

Found homicide victims through [hrc.org](https://hrc.org) and [transrespect.org](https://transrespect.org)(thanks to u/JustHere2RuinUrDay). Suicide victims found through [wildhunt.org](https://wildhunt.org). Links below

# Edits: Added in source to trans murder victims worldwide, their names, and changes to my post to reflect the worldwide victims. Latest edit to add in trans suicide victims"	"[deleted]
Came to post this. Thank you bb. May they rest in power. So much collective grief to process.
It's so miserable that our rights are still violated and mistreated
>working on naming them in this post too

I can help you with that. It's too many to fit into a post though

Disclaimer: For some of them we don't know their names, but we know their story and you can read that when you download the list. Also 

>These numbers are just a small glimpse into the reality on the ground. The majority of the data came from countries with a strong network of trans and LGBTIQ organisations that conduct the monitoring. Most cases continue to go unreported and, when reported, receive very little attention.

Thank you to the TGEU for doing this research

Thats too many names...
Thank you, I did this last year but didn't have the motivation to this year
Well, and those outside of the US. Please?

https://transrespect.org/en/tmm-update-tdor-2022/
I don't know if that's a good idea or anything, but could you find a list with people who suicided because of transphobia? I think those people deserve to be remembered as well
May these people rest in peace, and my greatest love goes to their families and friends, the pain these people go though is unimaginable to me. They shall not be forgotten
My ex is on that list there was a tdor event in my city and I didn't go because I knew it would ruin my week. I'm happy I can say goodbye to her and all the other victims of transphobia around the world.
I love you mofos. If anyone needs to talk hmu.
I went to a vigil for tdor yesterday. The ammount of names from the us that were read was pretty insane...
I met a trans woman from the us there too. She recently arrived here (portugal) under asylum from what she went through...
no
https://tegram.click/UUAWmBRvISM3ZWFk
Where did this take place? I can’t find anything online ??
Where did this take place I can’t find anything online
I know I’m late to comment here, but dang… this just saddens me
Even if there was just one name on this list, it’d be too many 😔🏳️‍⚧️
Same. But also resolve to fight for our rights, not just for myself but for everyone like me. No trans kid should feel unloved. No person should feel alone and scared. No one should face discrimination or hatred for how they were born or living their authentic life. I'm going to have a cry and then go on living life to the fullest and fighting to honor those who were not as fortunate. Our comrades shall not be forgotten, and the world will continue moving in the right direction. I will force it to, if needed. This horror will not continue.
That just means the weights on our shoulders to keep progressing.
Thank you again! I wish I'd have read your comment first, but I ended up working on compiling all the names from the Trans Respect source too and kinda didn't read any of my reddit notifications until I just finished 🤦‍♀️  


I do wish I had put further time into looking for a list for worldwide victims before I made the initial post, and I seriously thank you for having found this and put them all into a list too! ❤️

There really are too many people being killed. As I had been spending bits of my free time today researching a bit more about a few here and there, then remembering how many anti-trans laws are getting passed worldwide, it just.. really hits you just how much trans lives are not recognized by so many bigots out there. It's really difficult to deal with, and I've been crying off and on today to be honest. It's just making me feel like I'm glad to have left the state I used to live in that is full of transphobes. I don't think I'm going to ever be comfortable in any extremely regressive and religious area or any place with far right people in it. They just are totally ignorant, don't give a shit about trans lives, or actively are the perpetrators of hate-based crimes against us. Why can't people just leave people alone and let us just live how we want to live?
Yeah, it's a lot and in my country at least, our biggest lgbt org estimates an 80 to 90% dark figure on queerphobic violence.
Thank you!! I was struggling to find a name list worldwide, so I apologize my post was US-centric. I'll edit it and credit you for finding this if you're okay with that :)
I think it's a good idea, thanks for suggesting it. I am working on a list now. I found the below source which has worldwide trans deaths from homicide and suicide for the day of remembrance, which their cause of death is listed to the right. Looks like quite a few are listed suicide so it's just a matter of I'll grab those names with suicide as the cause of death and compile them.  


[https://wildhunt.org/2022/11/transgender-day-of-remembrance-2022.html](https://wildhunt.org/2022/11/transgender-day-of-remembrance-2022.html)  


It may be a half hour-1 hour before I finish because I'll keep looking for other sources on trans suicide for the past year, but I suspect because of suicide generally not being criminalized or even probably not reported on as much as homicides are, I worry many will not be known. I'll comment again if you'd like to see a list of the suicide victims in my post too(will edit it to add them in as well)
I managed to be able to edit my post! I had added a list of suicide victims as well
I am unsure precisely what you're asking, but the people I found were from the linked website in my post, Human Rights Campaign. They also mention where each person was killed if that's what you're asking? Searching each individual name in a search engine will also bring up news stories, should you be interested in reading more about each individual murder victim.
Of course it is! But we have to keep on fighting and supporting each other until the battle is won to make a beautiful would to live freely
Thx <3

Edit: I'm sorry, I should not have assumed a lack of consideration
My first idea was to say ""Hey great!"" but that's not the right words, but thank you for compiling that list though."	z0ed0e	trans	612	0.98	2022-11-20 20:29:05
Had to be checked before I start working and I am fucking broken rn	"Hi 🎂
I just have to vent about it and here is a good place. 
I had to do my pre-work checks (if I am able to work and shit) so I went to the clinic that does all that. 
I will say that cause I guess it is kinda important - it's all in Poland. 
So I still have my dead name and a wrong gender on my ID, right? But my looks are not THAT masculine at this point (I can't be love I am saying that with all the dysphoria I am experiencing). I go in, looking like a fucking princess and like, you know, I start registering. The lady there was nice to me. She reason the card, where I specified I am on HRT and stuff and she goes ""oh sure, every pretty lady can fill this paper"", and gave me the paper. That was heart warming. But everything that happens after, isn't. So I gave her my ID, and the longer she was looking at it and writing down informations, I felt more and more bad. At the end, when I got registered and received all the papers about where do I go and stuff, I start sobbing cause I see all the informations I don't want there to be. Even more I had to fill a card about my health and in Poland you have to fucking cross words on the card that do not match YOUR GENDER, which made me even more sad. 
First doc didn't even stutter to misgender and deadname me. I just say on the fucking chair and literally cried while he was checking me. 
Went out, and went to another doc. She just looked at, at the paper, and with a cold stare in the eyes said ""so is everything okay MISTER"". I was at the fucking edge. I started crying even more. I just went out without a word, taking my papers. The whole one hour walk home I  couldn't stop crying, and even today I am still a fucking mess and can't get this out of me. 
It's not for me. 
The only thing I can think about is just ""I'm so sad I was born like that"". 
W/e. I just had to write it down somewhere and get this shit out of me cause why not. 
I hope you will have a good day at least. My transgender week did not start well. 
🎂🧡🐼"	"Dang sis.. i really hope things'll get better for ya soon and im only a  dum 17 yr old but if ya need to talk to someone i can be here for ya. :<
I am incredibly sorry for this, and I know a strangers comment on reddit probably will not help that much but girl, we are here all for you. Everyone has had experiences like this, some worse and some not that bad but we all understand the struggle and we all support each other. Thank you for sharing even if it was hard to remember the details, but for me it shows inmense strenght and bravery to share experiences such as this one. Don't ever give up Queen <3
Oh fuck that. 

You deserve better, and those stupid fucking doctors will get their karma.
I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Not fun. But you've got this girl!
Poland is SO backwards about this stuff.  And the government is pushing all the time to make it MORE backwards.

I'm so sorry this is happening to you.
I'm so sorry for that!! You deserve respect, being examined while crying is absolutely NOT OK. Doctors should be more human and empathetic. Sending virtual hugs your way <3
That is no way for professionals to treat a beautiful lady like HoeMia.  They should be ashamed, not you.
All the hugs!
This is the path we must take till we finish our dream.  There are haters and jealous people out there that live to hurt others.  Hang in there and be the proudest and best you can be.  We are your sisters and have cried the tears with you.  Don’t let them make you cry.  Your pillow is for that.  I transitioned in a security setting, dominated by males, and now a blonde girl gives 70 of them orders.   Huggs and be Beautiful.
Girl I feel you 
The place that gets me my hrt deadnames me every time it’s unbelievable.

I really hope your female week goes girly from now on.
And if you ever need to talk (or a place to run away to) I’m here to listen (and about three hours away from Poland)
I don’t even know what to say.

I hope things get better for you.
My heart goes out to you. Every doctor around the world who utters the creed should know first to do no harm and it harms literally nobody to respect one's gender and to recognise they are a valid person no matter what or how convicted they are of their identity. Any doctor who behaves otherwise and fails to treat a person as a person ought not to practice.
That sounds horrible. I can barely handle being misgendered too much, so I can't imagine how that felt. Im so sorry about that
Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened hon. People can really suck sometimes, I'm sorry. If you need to talk to someone, my inbox is open. We're all rooting for you girl!
They tried to take your dignity and they failed. Stay strong.  You know the truth.  You are a beautiful, fucking woman!
Show them my links below. I'm proud, not shy, gay, embarrassed, ashamed, afraid -  no regrets of becoming Trans Woman. Post-op since 2018. There are many more people in this world who have changed their indentity and are happier as a result. I accept feedback from critics. Going back to work, next week, as a Licensed Sheet Metal Worker alongside other men. I haven't had any issues, at least not a big deal to resolve. Stand up and be strong. It's a challenging journey. There's some unpleasant surprises ahead but just face it head on. I live in Kitchener Ontario Canada 🇨🇦

Those are just horrible human beings

Reading this I just wanted to go psycho and threaten the 2 assholes who misgendered you... I hate this
I am so sorry you had to experience. Although the world is changing, it changes slowly, and there will always be people so consumed by their own hatred and ignorance they will never be able to free themselves. Please think about that. You are freing yourself to be who you know they are. They will probably be trapped in the vile cesspool of their own minds forever. Listen, I know this doesn't help how you feel now, but do not let anyone defeat you. This is YOUR LIFE! It is up to you fight for yourself. I find it helps me when I look at people who try to harm me (over anything) and instead of anger I feel pity for them. It is empowering and liberating. Good luck. :)
Stuff like this infuriates me. They knew exactly what they were doing and how they were hurting you intentionally. Don’t worry about those scum bags they’ll get theirs
Ohh ✨ thank u sm 🧡 I'll remember that for sure 🐼
Thank you for the support 🙈✨
Yes, Poland does not at all seem like a safe place for trans folx. OP, I would seek asylum somewhere else in the EU if you can.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Poland
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT-free_zone
Reminds me of the quote:
“Sometimes people use ‘respect’ to mean ‘treating someone like a person’ and sometimes they use ‘respect’ to mean ‘treating someone like an authority’
“And sometimes people who are used to being treated like an authority say ‘if you don’t respect me, I won’t respect you’ and they mean ‘if you don’t treat me like an authority I won’t treat you like a person’
“And they think they’re being fair but they’re not and that’s not ok”
From someone on Tumblr
Ur welcome pleaae have a very good day ☺
Poland is an EU country, anyone in Poland can move to any other EU country - no asylum necessary.

The issue is it's expensive to move, it's hard to find meaningful work, you have to leave your family behind, you have to learn a new language etc.

Moving isn't an option for everyone sadly - even if legally allowed at any time and like moving from Alabama to New York as far as legality.

So getting misgendered in the hospital sucks	"Like idk I thought if I could be safe from that anywhere it would be here :/
But like 
Armband has male on it still 
And I keep looking at it
And everyone is ""he""ing me until I correct them 
Like basically at the point of ""here's your estrogen, sir!"" Unironically 
Idk what the point of this post is but I am bored and sad and on morphine so this is what I have to offer"	"The hospital here has the weirdest way of not gendering me. The hospital bracelet always says “Sex: Adult”. They have my legal name, and then my name in quotations and it’s really hit or miss who calls me what. The psych ward I want sent to for a month in 2020 was through them, as well as my…you know I have no clue what she is, psychiatrist? No clue. She fills my meds and makes sure I don’t currently feel like offing myself. So they have ***all*** that on file. They were definitely better about gendering me correctly and using the right name after they had it on file that it literally makes me suicidal. Not saying you should tell them that’s what it does to you, but hey maybe you could.
Literally hate it when I go to the pharmacy (with my trans flag mask on) to get my testosterone and they go ""thank you ma'am, have a nice day"" 🙄
As someone who works in a hospital I can say that it's TRUE not a safe place for people to Express themselves and their gender identity. Most of the nurses I worked with are very insensitive and flat out transphobic. I do live in the south but it was very hard to see a patient get treated that way and to think they would do the same to me.
Oh yeah, doctors fucking love asking you “is this Spiro for acne?” and then you tell them you’re trans and then literally every sentence they’ll misgender you. They live for that shit
you're in the hospital? god damn. hope you're okay. :(

here's to your recovery!
Okay. *takes deep breath* trying to shake off the disappointment in some members of my profession…

So there is something you can do.

Look around and see if there is a “patient satisfaction”, “Patient experience” person, they may have a contact number available in some of the paperwork. If not, pick up your phone and call the hospital operator. This person carries a lot of weight, and usually reports directly to the hospital CEO. The will typically come to your room and listen to what you’ve been experiencing. This is reported to the CEO. The nurse managers (all of them) are all told to correct and educate staff. The one over your floor may be told to come and apologize to you personally. They may be told to investigate your report, (they may want names) they should leave a card so you can call them. 

If none of this happens… and you are in a US hospital… you may receive a survey. Please do the survey. That survey is counted toward the hospital’s Medicare payments. If their satisfaction scores drop so does their payment amounts.
I can understand why they would give the armband simply because we were born male and male bodies do react differently  than female bodies to some medications and sometimes require a higher or lower dosage, but they should still ask prefered pronouns, that sucks.
this is the part where you disasociate into the realm you desire
Personally, a hospital is the place I would be the least offended my misgendering. They have to focus on biology over social aspects as a matter of necessity, so even if it was annoying, I would understand that medical fields are more concerned with sex than gender
[removed]
I have never been misgendered and even of they did say it, they say it in a low voice that no one would know what they said. I only ever had one worker at Pret A Manger call me sir and I reported her to their headquarters. With that said there is still discrimination here and one of the places where I find them rampan is when I look for work.
Ya cuz when you freely start editing your pronouns it confuses people
Yeah it sucks. I got misgendered after getting a vaginoplasty.....
if any one needs test pm me
I hope things get better Reily, how long and for why were you in the hospital?
""Doctor, this adult has broken their leg. Adult says it's bleeding out too--"" i can't 🤣🤣
I have to yell at my pharmacist every time I'm there because they call out my partner's deadname despite her legally changing it four years ago. Every time they point to the deadname on the file and say ""it says *deadname*"" to which I point at her chosen name in brackets DIRECTLY NEXT TO THE DEADNAME and say ""and here it says *chosen name*. the script is estrogen"". Pretty much the script for the last three years we've gone to the pharmacy. Real tired of it.
Stories like this make me feel so lucky to have such a good pharmacy. The manager is the one who handled my t the first time and I can just tell I won’t have any issues if any of her staff are transphobic towards me. 

At the end of the day, they’re the ones who look stupid. Just remember that.
OMG! Literally the SAME EXACT thing happens to me every single time! I go in wearing my Trans flag mask gaiter thing to pick up my estrogen, long hair and nails done with just about every ounce of woman energy I can give and I get “hello sir, can you read your name to me as it is on your ID? Thank you sir “ etc.
So I get to stand there feeling like shit, reading off my deadname and getting misgendered the whole time.
ima nurse and transgender ... can confirm this .. healthcare suckz :(
I don't believe this is necessarily true.  If you're on GAHT you will more likely react in a way that women do to medication because estrogen changes the physiology of your body and how it processes things.  

And certain things are particularly dangerous if they don't take into consideration that your T is suppressed and replaced with E.

Also dosages, etc. Are likely to be be in the feminine range afaik because the other stuff changes too.  For example, trans women become much less tolerant of alcohol after starting HRT.
Thanks to the sweet fuck all research done on medications and their effects on different genders, medications are typically not changed by gender (or by weight in adults it’s super weird). Ones medical history would state any current medications eg E/T and side effects of those would be considered if appropriate to the differential. 
The only time it matters (obvs other than around actual genitalia/reproduction) is for blood transfusions. Sometimes. 
Being trans in a hospital shouldn’t be the big fucking deal that it is 🤦
My cardiac symptoms match the patterns of my hormones. If this surprises anyone, they're not nice enough to acknowledge it.
Can we stop this? For real, every time the issue of “biological sex” or misgendering in medical spaces is brought up, some people come out and claim that this is necessary and useful.

No, it is not. Biological aspects include your hormone levels, and they are in fact one of the most important biological aspects. But you know what that armband that says “male” doesn’t inform any doctors about? That this person might not be running on testosterone. It is, at best, completely useless because medical personnel needs to look into the medical file anyways to find out anything relevant. At worst, it is harmful because they might make wrong assumptions based on it. 

And even if this wasn’t the case, that’s still no reason for medical personnel to misgender you to your face. There is no possible medical benefit of it.
2 things: you're still a human, and despite all of the talk about biological sex, the reality is that on HRT, your blood and many other biological factors are going to match the gender you have medically been transitioning into, rather than your assigned sex at birth. Sure there are still some differences, mainly anatomy, but even that's changeable with surgery.
“BiOloGY”…. Seriously.
Ah a d fan has made into yet another trans related sub. 🙄 surprise.

Debate pervert
Thank you. I actually only just got home like an hour ago. Went to the ER Sunday, was stuck there this whole week basically. Basically my gallbladder has been causing me to randomly get EXTREME pain when I eat certain things, and Sunday it got bad enough that I went in to find out why. So essentially that thing is broken and needs to come out, but they just kept doing tests on me (and not letting me eat at all) and whatever. I'm supposed to get surgery to get that removed next month :/ 
But yeah that whole stay sucked a lot. 
Apparently taking estrogen can increase your risk of that (granted I was already at a very high risk since I've had an eating disorder and lost a lotta weight very fast, but yeah) so be careful! It sucks!
I think you're right about all this. At the moment I'm 7 months on e, so I kind of imagine I'm in a bit of a weird place for that, where it isn't as simple as ""give her the dose you'd give a cis woman"" yet but also not just ""give her the dose you'd give a cis man"" either anymore. They of course know I'm doing HRT and for how long so I assume they've got it
The AGAB and hormone effects should be warnings on the chart to inform medical treatment, the pronouns should be included on the wristband to inform social treatment. Bam, solved.
Word on the alcohol. One drink and I’m dizzy. I haven’t touched it since. Been 2 years now. Don’t miss it anyway.
The only thing I can really imagine having any effect is anesthesia, due to how easy it is for them to kill you in general. That and long term inpatient care over someone who will lose huge amounts of weight from pre-transition due to how fatty tissues can often release chemicals that they trapped while forming.
[removed]
I would be surprised if you shouldn't be dosed as a cis woman with whatever bodyweight you have.  Changes to things like blood and physiology happen very quickly.  It's like within 3 months that your Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, and RBC get into cis female ranges.  At 7 months I would expect you would be safer on the fem doses for your weight.
If you call a woman “sir” you are not referring to a nebulous and ambiguous concept of “sex”, you are misgendering."	u6umh9	trans	541	0.98	2022-04-19 02:43:00
My old Reddit account had a gendered word in the user and it made me sad so I made a new account rip my acc that was a year old with over a thousand karma because Reddit doesn’t let you change usernames		"changeable usernames would be the only good update Reddit would have
I feel this. My old reddit account just straight up had my deadname in it. Sure felt nice seeing that everytime I commented :(

&#x200B;

RIP the 3 year old account, you won't be missed because what value does Karma even have
[deleted]
My old account had a part of my deadname in it, so I had to do the same. I left behind a good amount of karma. It's so annoying that they won't let you change it.
my snap user and old reddit user both have my deadname in it. so i feel
fwiw, I dump my accounts about once a year or at 10k karma, whichever comes first. I've thrown away accounts with over a million karma.  

Karma is useless.  

Not being stalked & doxxed = priceless.
I’m in the same situation. I’m too attached to this Reddit account though. Changeable usernames would be so cool!
Same but almost 11 years and 71k+ karma. But it's the name of a character so I'm not too bothered. I do wish I had used a better name on this account though. It is so new that I might just change anyway
Same. It was annoying having to deal with not being able to post or comment on some subs because of 30 day rules and shit.
Ayoooo happened to me

&#x200B;

jjst change willingly with got suspended by transphobic.
Rip
Oof I’m in a similar position for a few platforms like Snapchat. I now only use gender neutral (like A.Bobson instead of Aaron.Bobson for example) usernames but for Snapchat and similar it sucks having to delete it. It’s awkward to ask people to refollow and read me to the close friends and stuff :(

I wonder why they don’t allow it. Clearly it’s very possible and easy for them to change so I guess they’re just being selfish or something. I get with reddit the idea is that you can’t disown your previous reputation but I don’t think allowing a change per year or maybe 1 or 2 lifetime changes would be that severe :/
My other account has a gendered word in the user name. Part of the issue though is it's so deeply connected to me as a user name I can't give it up. It's difficult to see a ""Mr"" and have people assume I'm a guy but it is what it is I suppose.
I did the same thing with my steam account and have the word “man” in the username. I made the account 9 years and you can’t change your account name on steam. I have a lot of games on the account and spend so much time playing games on it that it is not practical to make a new account so rip having a gender affirming account name :(
Updooted all the things.. You'll be back, Just in the this post.
my old account had my deadname in it lmfao
Im torn. Atrus isn't my deadname, but it is my old alias. I much prefer Ti'ana now, but I don't know if I want to abandon my account. Atrus isn't *explicitly* a masc or fem name, but I associate it with male
I had 19k Karma on my old account but it had my deadname in it so I had to ditch it. Managed to get this one up to 5.9k though. Clearly my shitposting can not be contained :)
Same dude, recently deleted my 2yo account because reddit refuses to let me change my username
My username is somewhat based on my deadname. But I'm too attached to my fake internet points to make a new account + it isn't literally my deadname and isn't that heavily gendered on its own.
This.   


I deleted my last user account during a mental health episode and now I can't use the name again so I had to put in an underscore.
Don't worry!  If you make 3 posts in trans friendly subreddits, you'll be over 1k lol

I'm at like 7 months and 23k or something (too lazy to check)
To be fair. Killing your AurlAB internet persona is easiest and most legal murder you will ever do.

Im gonna enjoy every second of unaliving that bastard. There wont be a single trace if him ever existing. Going genghis khan on his ass.


Shit! We still use this same reddit account.

Ssshhh everbody. No-one tell him.
same exact thing happened to me the only difference is i didn't have that much karma
I mean, it’s a fake name made of a bunch of words you created. How does that make you sad?
I had over 100K. Burn the past.
I dumped my 8 year old account for this one. I didn’t have it in me to go back and delete everything that was upsetting.
Well, it's only a thousand. Comment a lot and you should be able to get it back.
100k 

Let the past die.

Kill it, if you have to
Bump!!
After a few months this “alt” account already had more karma than my main got after like 4 years
1000 karma isnt that much dont worry youll have that much back in no time \^\^
Yeah, I've been thinking about creating a new account for similar reasons. Shame to see this one go, but it is what it is.
Damn, that's crazy, Definately won't happen to me 💀.
Our user name has a very masc name. Which is an old joke and not our dead name. Sadly we can update it to our new system name without throwing out the entire account.
same, my old reddit username had my deadname in it lol. rip all my karma
My auto generated user name is ""unfair"".  😖  I can't change it and that actually is unfair.
Another good update: treat usernames that have never posted/were created 10 years ago and have been abandoned with 3 posts, as if those names aren't taken
But would also kinda destroy the ""fish-fucker69"" legacy.

There are good reasons why company's try to avoid people from changing their user names, for example: recognition, no double names, no name stealing
Ikr
wait i know you, fancy seeing you here!
What do you mean fake internet numbers don't mean anything 🥺
Oh no you can't post on r/memes now or sth like that
You should really be replacing your account every few years anyway

The amount of personal information that slowly builds on a reddit account is quite staggering. If someone went through your post history with a fine toothed comb they'd likely find out way more than you would want them to if the account is super old
Yeah apparently from the way Reddit was coded it would be really hard to
same
Sad 😢
TO ME, your little emoji girl there tells us you're a female though. If someone was wondering about your name they would just scan over and look at that and be like ahh yeah, this is a woman.
I can relate to that I have went through and deleted all of my posts in a panic before and regretted it later
Idk man the brain is weird
How about having the usernames always be unique, but be changeable whenever? Or have separate usernames and display names (however that might cause double names though)
Could you elaborate on this legacy you speak of. Haha I’m unaware of said legacy
ayyyy, nice seeing you here

I'm just here to spread euphoria to my trans pals 😊
Good riddance
Unless you do the same yourself. From time to time I look for things I might've said that I don't want to be public and then I delete it.
Meh, what are they going to use against me? I've never once shared my email, my address, or anything close to these. I guess with enough digging they could eventually come across my business email, but that isn't signed up to anything so all they can do is send me a business email. 

And even if they do dig up enough stuff, so what? I'm not some rich person, I'm not some famous person. They're gonna find out that that one reddit girl who likes Minecraft lives at X.
[deleted]
If they wanted to do it they could. It’s owned by a very large company and has lots of investors.
Or nicknames for subreddits, that's something that Discord does which is cool and helps identify people within communities.
It's a reddit user known for always commenting to someone with ""fish"" in their name or when the post is about fish's.

I dont know of it was u / fish_fucker69 or or u / fishfucker_69 (but going through their comment's one of them seemed to be pissed about getting tagged all the time)
Call me they
I think so don’t quote me on it though
Well I think everything is saved under the username so they would have to go through and change it for every post for every user who changes their name would be a lot of work
Ohh I see, learn something new everyday. The internet is a weird place.
of course!
That’s kinda what algorithms are for. I’m sure they could add a column in their database, add a numerical ID tied on their username, and then change the relevant references in the code to the username column to the ID column thus freeing the username for changing. Or something like that. My experience with databases and SQL is VERY limited but that’s my understanding. It would cost them, but they could definitely do it. It’s just not really worth it for them cost wise since most people will either keep their account and put up with it. 

I could be wrong about the code part though but there’s pretty much always a way to do something through code and algorithms"	scz7lv	trans	529	0.97	2022-01-26 06:18:13
Banned from Tinder for being trans	"I'm not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but just recently I was banned from Tinder. 


I am a trans woman who hasn't started hrt, so I still look a bit masculine. It also states on my profile I am a trans woman too.


I hadn't had conversations with anyone, so I know I wasn't banned for fowl language or anything conversation related, I am over over 18 and look like it, so it was not due to that, and I cannot see any other reason why I was banned. Other than, a bunch of men reported me for random reasons, and I was banned. I'm so sad because it really boosted my confidence, getting matches and likes with so many people! Now I feel so lost!"	"Yes I’ve heard of it happens a lot on tinder!
It happened to me once, I messaged tinder using the email address on my account and they unblocked me that same day.

They also said that they'd put a note on my account so reports get reviewed rather than auto-banned xx
Depressingly, this is likely the case. You are far from the first person posting here with this exact experience with tinder
People can just report you and get you banned for no reason. I matched with someone from high school and instead of just rejecting me she reported me and I got banned. Like, Within 10 minutes of matching.
Honestly though...do yourself a favour and stay away from tinder. It's a toxic app designed to make you feel good at first and then destroy your confidence to make you want to keep coming back. It's a Skinner box gamifying people's desire for relationships to make profit. Don't do that to yourself.
Yep.
Ues OkCupid there much better and have a lot more options with gender etcer :)
If you're looking for guys and don't mind wading through the cesspit, Grindr

If you're looking for all levels of fem folx, try Her
You could also try joining fetlife and going to local events. Fetlife is broadly good for queer, poly and kinky relationships and events, but the events in your locality may vary significantly if you live in the country versus the city

Edit Koining to joining
Knowing this I’ll never use tinder, I don’t like transphobic apps!
Happens alot on that app. And Tinder outright defends it on their social media accounts iirc. Shit company, I'd suggest using anything but Tinder.
Honestly, they prolly did you a favour. Dating apps aren't designed to help you, they are designed to make money. Best way to meet people is in person dating tbh.
That sucks! I'm sorry this happened to you. Don't let it discourage you from continuing to put yourself out there to meet people.
I GOT BANNED TOO 🤬
I see a post like this every so often. Definitely happens.
I got a lot of softbans on Tinder for just being myself .... It happen more when you search for men
Happened to me as well
Fuck tinder. Use Hinge or OkCupid.
Lmao this has happened to me multiple times. I figure they automatically ban anyone who gets enough reports. Maybe it's sucky straight dudes, maybe it's TERFs, I dunno. Maybe your account could be rescued with manual review.
I was almost banned for being a trans man (I’m pre T and pre op, so I’m fairly feminine) from a multitude of women. This was when I lived in Tennessee though in a very conservative area. I’ve had no issues since I moved
Bumble just revamped their service to add gender options and seems pretty trans-friendly now too
Yeah, I've heard this happens a lot to cis women with short hair as well. A lot me on date sites tend to mass report women who are even just slightly ""too masculine"" in their eyes, for ""impersonating women.""
Have you tried taimi?
I met my wife on there. We are both trans.
Yep, happened to me as well
happened to me too, and hinge… bumble is the last resort at this point
Happened to me to, I've found bumble and hinge to be trans friendly
Yes seems like they ban trans
Is there a preference for gay or straight results on tinder? Could be the reason if so.
Same thing happened to me
happened to me too

fuck that app
.I'm so sorry. This mainly happens due to the large amount of accounts made to try and creep on other people using the title of trans woman on their page. It's not your fault at all, but that's so stupid that they didn't even bother to email you first to confirm anything before banning you. :(
That sucks!!! I know the appeal process for them is also basically nonexistent:(
Thats really weird. I thought they were supportive of transgender people because of the gender options on the profile settings
It happens a lot you can appeal and even if they say it’s “permanent” give a negative review about their helpline when the follow up and explain what you think happened being a TRANS person and they will reverse their decision so fast if you didn’t engage in anything break TOS
I had an experience like this too!! Was really disheartening but going on more LGBT centric dating apps has been much better and i feel safer doing so.
I’ve had a good experience with Bumble
It happened to me a few months ago.
Yeppp this literally happened to me last week and I was devastated because tinder was where I met a lot of my friends and the van just came out of nowhere
Surprisingly hasn’t happened to me been on Tinder a year now? I would say I’m passable only 4 months into my transition a lot of guys get mad when they see I’m transgender after messaging me first sure I’ll be banned eventually
Sorry that happened, there are other platforms of dating apps out there though.
Happened to be too eventually they lifted the  ban
literally every dating app 🙃🥺
happaned to me just a week ago. talked with a few people, most of them didn´t bother reading my profile even though it says trans in the first line, and i´m not 100% passing anyway. I sent an email to tindr support and they reopned my account in 3 days. but really, nothing good came out of tinder for me. all the discret boys are on grindr anyway, and queer people i can get to know IRL so...
Same shit happened to me twice ... I didn't go against any rules and they never gave me any reason other than 'violating community guidelines' 
But I marked that I was a trans man on both accounts because they have the option so why not use it and feel safe ... 
I tried to get my account back 2 times and every time I got the vague 'we have no way of unbanning you at this time as you violated guidelines' 
I barley was on it long enough to even talk to maybe 2 people and they new from the jump I was trans I made it very clear. 

I'm a trans man btw.
As a trans person I say dont go to tinder or apps like them, theres plenty of apps like Grindr . Straight men don't want to date trans people (or if they do they're on Grindr) Its wrong to say that theyre homophobic or transphobic because they won't date us. There's sooo many people these days who will. I don't go to Jdate and try to find love cuz I'm not Jewish . So I respect that they want to date other people like them. It's not bigotry in general (a lot of that does exist of course) so pick your  battles and know that it's important for us to respect them as much as it is for them to respect us. Sorry if that seems harsh but from the perspective of equality that's actually what we want (to be treated as equals means being banned from exclusive clubs just like everyone else) U know who goes to the front of the line at the amusement park right? Disabled people, we're not disabled, so we musnt try to go to the front the tinder ride when there's rides for us by us.... The world will never be perfect but look how far weve come. ... Sorry if I've offended anyone. I am trans woman pre HRT as well so I know things suck at times but most times are awesome... I live it, and love it, and I love all of you =D thanks for listening
Sorry to hear this happened to you.
I was just banned from Tinder also, for simply being trans. I chose the trans option, had it disclosed on my profile, and hadn't done anything to violate the Terns of Service. When I sent in a support ticket, they refused to help and closed out my request. I know they could review my account activity and see I didn't violate any policy andxyet they refused to do so. So frustrating!
I know I'm replying to an old post but this just happened to me... I emailed them and they literally copied and pasted the message that pops up when you try to log in to your banned account. They didn't even try to help me ?????????

Honestly fuck dating apps. Except okcupid, it's the only decent one!
Wait, really!? That's so insane, not to mention completely messed up :(
If you look at the Tinder support account on Twitter you’ll see that 99% of the tweets they respond to are trans people complaining about being banned, it’s a big issue.
Yea I think tinder works by default on a system of enough reports=ban and transphobes love reporting trans people for having a fake profile/wrong info whatever they call it.
Yeah, I tried this, but they didn't really seem interested in helping. They kind of just gave me some vague nonsense about me ""violating community guidelines"" and not much else.
Same happened to me...

And then later got an email saying they don't unban for any reason.

I think they may have staff that are transphobic with the power to ban
yeah tinders kinda shit, i met all my partners through discord and sharing mutual intrests.
Grindr is either good or a shitshoe no in-between
Oh man using Grindr to do anything except get paid(even then....) Is an absolute exercise in frustration.
i also just opened bumble this morning to see that enbies are no longer lumped in w men or women!
Her has similar problems. Atleast as of a few years ago
Taimi is too bad right now to be honest .
Trans people* trans is a adjective not a noun. We're still people
And what happened ?
Still not enough reason to ban trans people. We have a right to be there! As anyone
Yah that's dumb, sorry that happened girlie! Hinge is pretty inclusive in my experience.
I was actually ban from Twitter as well, quite awhile back, and I was only identifying as a alternative dresser. Because I had heard about them banning trans people.
For existing it called existing
Too many unsolicited dick pics hah😂

But I did match with 1 cute guy that affirmed My gender and was super sweet about everything! 

So yes, shit show or good.
I've met a few decent guys, but I definitely had to wade through the cesspit to find them. Best way I found to weed out people is have a fully filled-out bio with instructions on how to open (ie, ""no hi/hey/sup/wyd"" or ""start with your favorite color and why"") and then make your header say READ ME or the like; that way, you can automatically ignore a shit-load of people because anyone who doesn't take 5 seconds to read and follow the very clear and easy instructions isn't going to be worth your time.
That really sucks. 
We met over a year ago, been married a year.
I made a new acct 😂
No no thats exactly the criteria. We have the right to make all of our own apps. But we're cool cuz even the "" straight but lookin "" get to stay haha that's why people dislike trans people cuz things like that.  People just end up hating on you  they're anyways,  besides tinder sucks, Grindr is the best place to not have to pay for the app. There's alot of apps like Taimie too that are exclusively for trans... I was at McDonald's and the dude kept saying sir to me and I just smiled and was my usual polite self.
I was also banned on Hinge too because I was banned on Tinder :(
I'm so happy for you..
Taimi is a queer dating app!! I have had luck on bumble too!"	wkr4g6	trans	524	0.99	2022-08-10 07:29:32
clothes shopping as a deeply closeted girl :(	"I was out clothes shopping today and looking at the boys clothes I felt so... disconnected? Empty? Five minutes later and we're passing through the women's section and everything is so pretty!! My heart was doing a little dance, while the rest of me just felt vaguely sad as there's no way I can wear things like that :( Idk what I'm looking for out of this, I suppose I just needed somewhere to vent lol

I hope all of you lovelies are doing well❤"	"Had the same thing for years. Hated everything in the woman’s section because it made me feel like a girl. Eventually I just realized I was the one allowing those clothes to make me feel that way. Now I wear whatever, as long as it makes me happy and comfy. I promise someday your closet will be so full of women’s clothes you won’t have room for any more :D
How I knew sumn was up w me tbh. I remember going to the mall n picking out outfits for my friends, outfits I wanted to wear. Shit hurted loll
I know the feeling. Now at Marshalls and TJMaxx I just stick around in the women’s section with my mom (who I’m VERY not out to). I actually get a lot of women’s clothes/shirts that “look more unisex” because she agrees that the men’s section is trash lol.
Aw, isn't that just the worst feeling. I'm sorry bout that, being closeted and shopping.. ah, sucks. 

But hey, you got through it, so keep your head up! Bet you 100% one day you'll find the nicest outfit to wear and you'll rock it without even knowing \^\^
I love shopping at target.

There is usually this moment when the other women notice I'm shopping along side them and they accept me. It's really nice, lol kinda like animals at a watering hole.
Shopping online was a first step for me. I'm still too anxious to buy obviously femme clothes in person.

Edit: wrong to(o)
When i was in the closet i use to buy clothes like tshirt and jeans but in the men section (i’m a trans man) ; no one could really tell that i was wearing men clothes but i would feel so great and euphoric because of the different shape of the clothes (shape really change btw men and women section) you really should try it! And if you’re worried about label most of them can be cut. Also if you’re afraid of being judged about what you buy tell yourself that people will think you’re making gifts (i say that because i used to worry about this a lot). Hope it help you my trans sister! :)
I know the feel. 
 I went out today to try and buy clothes for the school year. After sitting in my car for 30 minutes I walked in and walked right back out.
I dont have the courage to tell my parents im trans a 4th time, each time they (mainly my mom) just brush it off and ignore it, not bringing it up for months so I can never get the clothes I ACTUALLY want when I go clothes shopping.
Its a joint struggle lmao
My heart breaks for you. I hope that some day you can be yourself, truly and unabatedly💕
It gets easier each time you do it 😌
You can still buy neutral-looking blouses and trousers/jeans. Nobody will be able to tell they're women clothes simply by looking at you, but you will know what you're wearing. (:
Honestly as an ftm, I can still appreciate how pretty girl’s clothes are. I also have to wear women’s clothes still because of sizing issues (though I occasionally buy a cheeky men’s sweater). I just choose the baggiest stuff. But seriously, women’s clothes are beautiful.
Have queer friends? Maybe shop with them?
Just wear whatever you want
I. Feel. You. So bad. I did the same the other day. You’re not alone
as a 6' tall, dad bod bearded woman who is just starting to shop in the womens section, the thing that pulled the trigger for me is just standing in it and looking through the clothes, and seeing how many other people actually paid attention to me being there. It turns out no one else cares if you take a few outfits home and put them on in your room. You might not escape without a dirty look from the cashier but that's about the worst of it.
Highly recommend Walmart clearance to figure out size... I've gotten shirts and pants for as little as $1! 

If you're in a situation where it wouldn't be safe for you to wear or own women's clothing, I'm sorry, and I hope you figure something out soon.
Try getting a womens flannel. They will look essentially the
Same but it may help you a bit knowing it’s womens
I’ve always called myself a “picky shopper” and never knew why until recently when I figured out that I’m trans. I’m still in the closet too. You can try experimenting with womens clothes at home and see how you feel in them.
I've started buying a lot more ""womens"" clothing lately and most of the time when I look in the mirror I end up thinking ""there's nothing obviously feminine about this other than it being in the womens section"". 

After the first couple shopping experiences I now have no shame being in the womens section and if I end up talking to someone I just say how boring the mens section is and they always agree. Then I fit right in. 

I'd just start trying more stuff on. You'd be surprised how much womens clothing works fine on men too.
You could always try taking someone with you or if someone asks say its for someone else
Just go shopping in a shop were no one knows you. You pick up, try and buy whatever you want and in whatever section you want.
The last time I went shopping for clothes I felt like everything was geared for guys in their 60’s that enjoy weekends “at the lake”, or T fueled maniacs that want to rip the heads off of things.  Kind of accepted that may be the last time I try shopping in boy mode.


Also by “at the lake” I really mean perpetuating casual racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, probably ace-phobia? And so forth.
Bring a girl friend with you and have her buy it for you? There's got to be ways.
I feel the same way honestly. Like it’s not even that mens clothing are that bad in anyway, it’s just not for me and they just don’t suit me well anymore as they used to (that and I just think boys clothing is somewhat boring). 

Going through the womens clothing was a fresh of breathe air. So may vibrant colors, lots of design, very pretty and cute outfits to choose from and combine. It was so exciting, though I could buy any or take them home with me unfortunately. 

One day I will though! :)
Aww I'm so happy that you could get to that place!! And thank you!! I really hope so🥰
Aww i know the feeling, it's awful right? I bet you have all the prettiest outfits now though!!🥰
Yeah, I do the same lol, or when I'm out with my girl friends I just stick with them😆 That's so cool! I might try that line of argument lol ;)
Aww thank you so much!! Your comment made me smile, and the thought of drifting about in a floaty dressy outfit made me very happy :) Thank you!❤
That is actually adorable!! I hope i get there one day🥰
I'm building up to ordering some girl clothes from Shein, I'm just worried about the parcels getting intercepted before I get to them😅
Aww thank you so much for the advice my trans brother!!!🥺 I'm honestly working up the courage to order some girl clothes - and I wear skinny jeans quite a bit so I suppose womens jeans wouldn't be too much out of place!❤
Yeah :( I'm sorry. One day we'll get there, I'm sure❤
Aww I'm so so sorry you're not being accepted :( I hope you're able to get the clothes you'd like to wear - and I'm sure one day you will❤
Thank you so much❤
Yeah I'm hoping so!❤
That's a wonderful idea! I think I will try that🥰
They seriously are so pretty aren't they?? I honestly wish clothing had no gendered connotations, if people want to be pretty let them dress pretty!

Also I wish there wasn't a trade-off - men's clothes is a lot more practical, or at least i think (I'm looking at pockets hahaha) Also YES. Baggy clothes are my saviour😆❤
I don't unfortunately :( Funnily enough i dreamt I did the other night! That's made me start thinking of trying to make some lol
If ONLY it were that simple😭
Thank you❤ It's nice knowing I'm not alone, but I'm sorry anyone else has to feel this way. We'll all get there one day!!
I really hope to work myself up to it one day!! I'm trying to get the courage to order things quietly online - I'd be terrified of being recognised if I actually went into the shops😅 Thank you so much for the advice though, I'm really trying to get my head around the idea that *no one cares* what I look at or buy in the shops, you know? I hope you have a wonderful day❤
That's a lovely idea, thank you! I do love a flannel shirt😄
I definitely will be once I work up the courage! And yeah, I've definitely been a picky shopper in the past lol😆❤
I absolutely will!! A lot of people have recommended getting... I guess you'd call ""stealthy"" women's clothes like you suggest! Thank you for the reassurance about shopping in the women's section - it's really helping me build up the courage!!❤
I think I'll say it's for someone else! I used to live with girl friends, but we've all moved home now :( I'm kicking myself for missing that opportunity lol
Yeah definitely!! I'm really working up the courage now so many of you lovelies are telling their own stories/reassuring me🥰
Don't worry I know exactly what you mean! I think this last time boy clothes shopping has definitely been a turning point for me❤
Yeah I could! I would be nervous to ask her, but that might work😄
Do you have a local friend who you are out to? I was going to suggest a PO Box but idk how old you are or how expensive that might be. 

I thought of this because while I am cis, I had a situation that was abusive and my mother got a friend’s mom to help with an issue of something I couldn’t have before leaving for school and returning home. It was…not a great situation. But it worked. I’m sorry you even have to go through that. I made sure my kid never had to go through what I went through and I made sure they didn’t go through this either. So if it is your parents, and you know what they will say, I’m sorry but know you will have people who see you and love you for exactly who you are. *hugs if wanted*
You’re welcome you go girl! 😁🤗
I sincerely hope so aswell, have a great day!!1
You could always do what I do. Wear really bright men’s clothing? Could help a little. ASOS does great, affordable clothing for men that isn’t boring adidas :)
I think it’d be a really good thing 🤗
You are not! It’s tough. I’m bald. That’s my issue. Tallish but thin so I could probably transition nicely! Who fucking knows lol
No problem! Flannel is amazing!!
I feel you. If it's any comfort, please know that no one is looking at you while you shop. As a former resident of NYC, I couldn't tell you who I saw on a daily basis. Try thrifting in a nearby town. It's a cheaper way to figure out your size
If it's still warm where you are start with shorts. Super easy to pass off as male presenting, but you get a little dopamine hit knowing they're meant for women. My short selection has progressively gotten shorter and more colorful/patterned through this summer yet I don't look like a man in womens clothes at all.
For me everytime I do it, in full boy mode(I prefer it that way because if something looks good or decent is going to look AMAZING once I put the effort in looking feminine) is difficult at first but then I get more and more comfortable.
I don't unfortunately!! I am completely in the closet lol😅 I could do that, I'm in my twenties so I'm sure I could sort it out. It's nothing near abusive - my parents are wonderful wonderful people and I love them very much. I'm simply not ready to be out, and I would have trouble explaining why on earth I had girl clothes, you know? I really genuinely appreciate your concern - the world needs more wonderful people like yourself❤ *P.S I will gladly accept the hugs!! :)*
Thank you, you too!!🥰
Oh that's a wonderful idea!! Thank you so much, I'll check it out🥰
It would be lovely!!🥰🏳️‍⚧️
You could definitely transition nicely!! Lots of girls are bald, and there's loads of lovely wigs out there. Also I think tall girls are really pretty🥰
Thank you! Thrifting sounds cute. I don't live somewhere quite so big as NYC but that is still very reassuring🥰 I think the consensus I'm getting really is that I can shop in the women's section without drawing *any* attention, which is really nice to know!
That's interesting! I wouldn't have figured shorts, I normally don't like having my (man) legs out. Maybe that's because I've been wearing shorts for men? I'll take a look though!🥰
No problem. I have a trans gf, and my kiddo is enby. And actually, since I was last on here I came out as gender fluid myself. I kinda didn’t realize I get the not ready thing. 

Except I realized it was my relatives that were my reason. I had to cut most of one side of my family out when my kiddo came out. I held onto a couple but realized they were the reason why. 

So I’m really glad to hear your parents are wonderful. It warms my heart to know that there are more good people out there.
Thanks ur litterally so sweet omg/p"	wokv8n	trans	523	0.99	2022-08-15 00:12:22
Protected a trans customer	"So, I don't usually wear much makeup to work, but last night was my last shift before Christmas. I did myself up just a little more than usual... still not really enough to draw much attention though...

A trans customer, who is working hard to pass, came into my store last night. She's about 5-10 years older than I and is bit heavy set. This customer still has many masculine features, and I fear she may still be quite sensitive about it, though I'm not totally sure. 

As my position with the company dictates, I have to say hello to everyone who comes into my store. And, while this other trans customer was in the store, a man came in and called me a fucking faggot. A little taken back by his response to my friendly greeting, I realized that my trans customer is now at risk of a potentially traumatic experience if this guy sees her. I immediately radioed my manager and he got that guy out of the store within two minutes. 

Apparently, when this guy was out of my earshot, he said that he would kill me if I came near him. I have thick skin, the army gave me that. But many of our sisters don't have thick skin. I'm glad my manager stepped up so quickly and protected his staff and customers. That was pretty awesome. 

It's sure sad that people can be so hateful of others. I don't understand why some people refuse to accept those who are different from them."	"I don't get why they're so hateful either. Who said they got to be in charge of how other people live their lives? Like mind your own business lmao. I'm glad y'all were able to get rid of that guy before he started trouble. That woman doesn't deserve to have to deal with pricks like that. Nobody should tbh.

Edit: Lmao I was referring to random strangers needing to mind their own business, not advocating for anarchy and overthrowing the government. Y'all need to chill out. 😂
It upsets me that there are people like that in the world but it makes me feel better knowing that there are people like you out there too :)
I was at a self checkout one day... still quite insecure in my presentation, and some guy took the register directly next to mine, and began talking about running me over, I should burn, all kINDS of hate... homophobic and transphobic included... I started out getting more uncomfortable by the second... but by the time he was done, I was furious... as he walked within inches of me headed toward the door, I turned slightly... and said ""don't you think that I won't stick my 6"" heel straight through your effing eyeball if you EVER threaten me again""... I said it in my best femme voice, a little sultry even... and that guy was so freaked out he dropped his bag, and knocked over a display jumping away from me.

From that day forward, I was able to feel more myself... I missed the confidence I'd had before coming out, and now I've got it back. Best moment in my transition for my mental well being.

You did good sis, and I wish you all the best along your beautiful journey!!!
Hi, you're wonderful. We gotta look out for each other sometimes <3
I don’t get it either. Someone else’s appearance, lifestyle, sexuality, whatever doesn’t affect your life. We’re all here on the same planet just trying to make the most of life. There’s no need to be an a**h focus on your own damn shopping
I've always thought of it as people hate others who are different to oneself but there really is no need to put your whole life into ruins in jail, cus you killed someone because you hate them because they're different. (ᵗʰᵃᵗ ʷᵃˢ ᵃ ᵐᵒᵘᵗʰᶠᵘˡ).

Also, good on you for calling your manager.
You’re my hero!
I don't understand why people don't just leave us be :/ u should be proud of urself for helping the other trans person in the situation :)
What’s the fucking point of being hateful for no reason? If someone did something to hurt you then I can understand it but we’re just trying to live our lives here.
Thank you for protecting her. I hope you are able to stay safe as well.

And yes, LGBTQ people *do* threaten these folks—or, rather, we threaten the cissexist heteropatriarchy they hold so dear. To paraphrase the song I heard driving home (you know the one), the shame is on their side. And we can beat them, forever and ever. And you were a hero, just for one day. ♥️
Sorry to hear that, they just project their own sadness onto the world, I bet he racks off to gay porn 100%
Honestly those people dont deserve any social interaction from anyone...if they cant play nice they shouldnt be allowed to play at all.
The man at the very least deserves a citation for disorderly conduct/public disturbance.
Thank you for taking action in the face of a horrible bigot. I am sorry that you were exposed to an awful evil human.
Huge huggles, some people are aweful!
Talk about a 'big sister' moment. Thanks sweetie for being strong in a crappy situation.
So I used to work at this sandwich shop. My roommates (at the time, real close friends for a hwile) are the assistant manager and a team lead. When I came out to everyone at work we very quickly found out that not one, but two other trans peeps already worked there, and they even picked up another trans guy a little later.
So the team lead roommate has been my closest friend since we met pretty much and she absolutely will not deal with transphobia from anyone. She takes it as her responsibility to protect her vulnerable employees, especially considering two of the four are actually her friends.
They hired a new guy a few weeks ago and there was a story on the news about a trans woman who robbed a gas station and this dude just let's loose, you know what I mean, I don't need to put the details but as soon as she realized what he was saying she told him to shut his mouth and look around the room because he, apparently, had no idea that he was outnumbered in that moment. She wrote him up for hate speech (the first time she's done that for anything) and told him if she hears anything like that again he's gone without a second thought.
You didn’t say a kind thing in your depiction of this woman. This very strong woman who’s skin is by far thicker than you seem to pity her for. She’s not afraid to be her whole self. She absolutely had more duplicates of your weird villein character on her commute to your amazing store. 

Fuck this is like my first time commenting on reddit. You’re all clout chaser narcissists right? I’m friggen scared
> Who said they got to be in charge of how other people live their lives?

I think this is why there are so many LGBT+ anarchists. Less government intrusion, more just taking care of each other.
^ 100% this, well said
Good for her!
Mate wtf it's not that big a deal, stop getting so worked up. The woman mentioned doesn't even know op, there's no chance of her getting offended or hurt by op's post, especially when the post is about how op did her best to keep another woman safe in the face of someone who would do them both harm.

Not to mention if op doesn't know her, then you certainly don't. Stop assuming things about women you don't know; yes, even if they're 'positive things' like ""she's a strong woman with thick skin who doesn't need protection because she probably gets hate-crimed regularly and can handle it"". That's not a kind thing to say, either.

As a trans man, I can't speak on what it's like to be a trans woman, but I do know the struggle of trying to pass, and op's description just sounded like an acknowledgement that this woman was trying (and struggling) to pass, and that bigots like the 'villein' would see that and target her. It wasn't hateful or 'unkind'. She was stating the facts.

There's no need to jump to anyone's defense, everything's fine, nobody needs to fight over an innocuous story on Reddit (especially when it's  inoffensive). This isn't Twitter.
I don't understand what you mean. Perhaps you misunderstood what I meant?
The incredible thing about your responses are how ironic they are. You call us narcissists yet won't admit that you're wrong and continued to act as if your opinion was right even though nearly no one here agreed with you as seen from your downvotes. Please be safe and I hope you have a happy holiday but what OP did was a good thing.
Mutual aid = less corrupt/able government intrusion and less police involvement. Reality is so many ""law enforcement"" ARE these hateful people and ARE given state authority to ""...be in charge of how other people live their lives"". Government policy is not, or is only thinly, favorable toward communities like ours!

So in conclusion, ""No gods, no masters!""
Lol wow
Intention is not an excuse. Who cares what you meant. I care about what a skid mark your stupid post was. You didn’t and don’t protect us at all and didn’t ask
Amen. Got to look out for everyone, especially the marginalized, but we all gotta exist together.

> Mutual Aid

And stock up for that shit. I really want my neighbors to be able to eat when shit hits the fan.
As the trans woman who was sworn at (yes, that was me, thank you), and as a staff member of the store, the safety of my customers and coworkers are my responsibility. Knowing that there was another trans woman in the store who could have been harassed or assaulted by this man, I did everything in my power to keep her safe. I don't protect all trans women. How can I? I'm just one person. If that makes this post a skid mark, as you said, then your expectations are unreasonable. 

If I were that customer, I wouldn't want to be asked by the trans associate at the store if I wanted protection from a potential predator. I would want to feel confident that I can go to that store and be safe.

This is probably one of very few genuinely noble things I've seen anyone say. If there were more people like that I daresay we might live to see the inner galaxy."	rmh9vr	trans	514	0.99	2021-12-22 23:06:12
Gf gets extremely sad every time I bring up bottom surgery	My gf (who is bisexual and cis) gets really sad every time I (MtF) talk about getting bottom surgery. She says I just don’t understand how big of a change it will be for her and that I’ll be a totally different person when I get it. My brain has already changed and most of my body has changed already anyways, so I don’t get why that specific part holds so much weight to her/ is so crazy. I mean I get that it’s a huge change and it takes time to process but her getting so extremely depressed over it is something I just don’t understand. She says she has an attachment to that part of me which I get but again I don’t understand why it’s SUCH a hard thing for her. I’m not really sure what to do.	"I've had this conversation with my wife and I'm affirmative about my choice. But I also told her that if she wants, we could always make a mold  of my member before it goes. It may not be the same but it's the best I can offer~
Her priorities are wrong. She's prioritizing her own enjoyment of your body over your happiness, and she's attached to a body part you don't identify with.

It's fine for her to like a particular body part, but in this context, it's dehumanizing. Especially the way she's communicating about it. She gets depressed about you wanting to do something that will make you happy? What does she love - you or this one part of your body?

I hate to put it that way, but that's the way she comes across based on what you wrote here.
>I don’t understand why it’s SUCH a hard thing for her.

It's actually not a hard thing for her but that's precisely the problem. 


I'll see myself out.
That's not okay! It is your body and she needs to accept that you can do whatever you want. She should be happy for you. It's okay that she isn't 100% happy with it but that shouldn't bother you. If you want bottom surgery and it will make you happy, get it! :) at this point your girlfriend is being a bit selfish tbh
Honestly as someone dating a trans girl, I know that my gf is going to go through some serious change and I accept that. It might not be what I expect- both her AND I are going into her transition blind as fuck. Hormones could bring us together or pull us apart but I'm going to do everything in my power to support her with whatever decision she makes. I love our intimacy together but ultimately my gfs decision on bottom surgery is hers and hers alone and i have no say it it nor do i have a right to be upset about it. It is HER body, not mine.
Do you know Jammidodger and his fiancé/wife, Shaaba (idk if they’re married yet)? They were in a relationship since before he transitioned and when he got bottom surgery, Shaaba spoke about it in the lines of this, “It’s just something new that we’re both going to explore.”

That’s how your girlfriend should see it.
I understand both sides and I think from her perspective she loves u for who u are and if sex is a major part of your relationship it litterally changes everything especially in the bedroom u two need to have long sit down discussion about how u both perceive the change in your relationship with this if you want it to last at the very least it will clear the air
Please don't let her block your way. If you want it, do it! Nobody can stop you 💙
It's your body, dude. I don't know why she's being so depressive over it, but I feel like significant other should get in the way of you being comfortable in your own body. If my boyfriend did that to me, I'd still get the surgery. Idk if that sounds harsh, but if it's really what you want, go for it. 

But you don't need to take this advice (obviously) and it's just what I think. Do whatever makes you happy.
That's a really selfish thing for her to say and not okay at all. Genital preference is a thing, often a deal breaker, you should be prepared for that.
Fuck what she thinks, it’s not about her and not her body. It’s YOUR body, YOUR dysphoria, YOUR transition. And if she has a problem with it as it sounds like she does then she needs to decide to support you or get the fuck out of the relationship. I’m mad for you.
It is unfortunate but true that when you get bottom surgery your gf loses something she has been rather fond of. It is entirely understandable that she might feel grief. But that grief isn't a reason for you to not do it, or to feel bad for doing it. And to ask her not to feel it would be childish wishful thinking. 

Grief is how we let go. It can't be reasoned with, and it can't be rushed.

Your desire to get bottom surgery is valid and brave. But the people around you are messy, emotional, helplessly human too. It would be easier for your transition to be without consequence for her or others, but that just isn't the case. If they love you and are decent they will grieve and then they will adjust. In that sense, it isn't about you - she's just human.

A lot of the responses here are about what your gf should or shouldn't feel. But humans are messy and we can't dictate feelings to others. We need grace, and we need to give grace. Your gf really likes your cock, and she'll miss it when it's gone. That's OK. Give her the grace to grieve it and process that emotion.

Only once she's grieved what she's lost can she turn herself fully to what she has gained.
She just needs time I think.

A dildo is very different to a real dick and she seems to greatly enjoy that part of who you were. 

Maybe it is because she is used to your image and feel with a dick and feels it is emotionally taxing to lose a part of you (the phrasing is a bit off but I hope you get my point)

I expect logically she fully understands you need to lose it but emotionally struggles to accept it. 

Neither of you appear to truly be frustrated or aggressive to argue about this. She still loves you for you and will accept you even after the change.

I speak from experience though when I say women with dicks and femboys are very attractive to a bisexual. This probably plays a part too.
I think I can kind of guess what she might be feeling. If you've had PIV sex, then she may associate that part of you with a sense of connection and intimacy. It's scary to lose something that makes you feel connected with your partner.

Over time, I'm sure she'll get used to your new equipment, and learn new ways to feel connected.
I'm in a similar boat, every time I talk about anything transition related my wife says she's mourning the old me all over again. The real question is who do they love? Do the love who we are or who they want us to be?
She shouldn't want to hold back your transition for her own pleasure. It's your own body do what you want and try having a conversation with her about WHY she cares so much
I may get a little hatred here; but before I fully realised I was also trans. My boyfriend (FtM) was discussing bottom surgery, at that time I was worried as if this was the case; i'd have to resort to helping him sexually in a more... other hole sense and that urked me a lot (No not because it was gay, it was because I was panicking over nothing, like cleanliness and such.)
But I sucked it up after a while, told myself that ""Should I really stop the love of myself finally be in the body he was meant to be all because I was scared of a little doodoo mistake?"" 
Both scenarios are a little different; I can understand her point of view but she also needs to think outside box a little, there are many MANY ways to do things in bed that don't require a biological penis, to toys and more. She's not going to lose any pleasure points.
your gf sucks shit and shouldnt be focused solely on her comfort and pleasure when you are supposed to be the light of her life.
Your body your business. She may be your partner but that doesn't give her the right to control what you do with your body. Just do it. If she doesn't like it then that's her problem. Do what makes you happy.
I kindof get it. But at the same time that feels (to me) like more of a fetishized aspect of things. Like you are who you are and your body doesn’t define you so why should it matter what’s downstairs? Thats just a really strange situation you may want to ask some deeper questions about specifically why she wouldnt want that. It obviously changes things in a sexual aspect but that shouldnt be why youre there yk?
Sounds like either a hard long talk or an ex-gf. Nervousness for your health, excitement for the future, normal, natural emotions a caring partner would express. Sadness? Nah lmao fuck that.
My tldr advice is dump her(: just trust me. Been there, done that, twice.
It's sad to say that you need to split and be yourself and have the bottom surgery to make you whole.
If she can't understand just how important the bottom surgery is to you then she obviously only cares about how she feels.
You need to be with someone who accepts you as the woman you are.
You need someone who understands that you need the vaginoplasty so your body matches the way you feel.
Having bottom surgery rids you of the last vestige of the gender you were assigned at birth.
Holding that guilt over your head because she doesn't want you to get rid of your phallus is really quite cruel and self serving.
If she honestly loved you there would be no problems with you getting bottom surgery.
My girlfriend hasn't started transitioning yet, we need to deal with family first and she needs to go to a doctor who specialises is trans healthcare so she can get hormones etc. She asks me if I'll miss her current anatomy and tbh since I'm accustomed to it yea I think I will miss it a bit. 

But that doesn't change the fact that she want to transition and I'm not stopping her in any way. In fact I want to donate my uterus and ovaries to her so she can have my estrogen and progesterone and other hormones I forget what they are. I did get this thing called clone-a-willy which let's you mould a... eggplant... for stuff, so we can still have a semblance of her before transitioning.

Your girlfriend is being very insensitive about your transition and you may need to have a very serious talk with her about that. Heck she may just be clueless as to how important this is to you and needs a reality check. If having a......banana.....is that important to her you can see about that clone a willy thing or something?
As someone who’s has gender reassignment surgery, the only way that we “change” is for the better. My mental health improved leaps and bounds when I was no longer chained down by my dysphoria and I’ve been able to deal with my issues in an impactful, helpful, and life changing way. People who perpetuate this idea that trans people “change” when we start hormones or get surgery are people who know we won’t be as easy to control or manipulate because we’re more confident in ourselves and our bodies. You deserve a partner that will support you and celebrate your transition, not try and talk you out of it. It’s *your* body
Her pain isnt greater than yours and her putting herself over you isnt fair.
My wife feels the same, it’s sort of a grieving process, I have to remember that this is just as much as a transition for her as it is for me. It takes time. Be kind be patient. It’s fair to be sad, when the person they love is sort of disappearing in subtle and substantial ways before their eyes. Communication is so important, good luck!
It’s a hard decision for both parties. Either she has to be ok with your surgery, or you will have an ex. 

Don’t be sad about breaking up though, it’s the best for both if you can’t find a common voice.
How are you bisexual and cis?
I think what she’s saying is that she won’t be happy with you if you do that. That doesn’t necessarily mean she’s trying to manipulate you. Rather, it could be her clueing you in to the fact that this is a deal breaker for her. 

While I get your side of this, because I want to do the same, I see her side as well. She wants to date someone with a penis, and she has every right to do that. That is who she is. It’s not fair to ask her to change.
nsfw but while I don't know your relationship, it's possible she could be so hung up for sex-related reasons. another q, have the two of you talked about having kids? that's the only other reason I can think for someone to get so hung up over something like that. and if it is that, you might want to sit down and talk through that.
I get where she is coming from. Sex will be very different for both of you after bottom surgery. Sex, even with toys, will never be the same. You should definitely talk about how that is going to impact your relationship. Bisexual people, in my experience, do not like to be restricted to one kind of sex and that could be a problem if you don't sort it before surgery.

When it comes to our transitions, it is our body, our choice, but you cannot glaze over the choice she will have to make for her body if you choose to live in a monogamous relationship.
Honestly here's what's going to have to happen:

She either accepts it and is okay with it and you guys remain together.

Or you leave her.

You *cannot* settle for being a lesser version of yourself for someone else. As to *why* she feels this way, my guess is that it's mostly likely one of two things:

 She still sort of sees you in as masculine light. She accepts you being trans in every way because you still have a penis to fuck her with. She still feels like she's with a man, even if subconsciously.

Either that or she's just not attracted to vaginas and she realizes she will be losing a part of you that she finds more attractive. The thing about that is it's a selfish desire on her part and she shouldn't be using it to prevent you from being yourself. If it's such a deal breaker then she needs to break up with you.

You say she's bi, but that doesn't mean she likes all parts equally.

Also, she's gaslighting you with telling you how you don't consider how it makes her feel. You know who else says that shit? Transphobes.

It's transphobia. Don't make excuses and don't *take* excuses. It's transphobia.

She either accepts you or you dump her. Don't settle for less, because that means settling for a lesser version of you.
Well, if you have sex with somebody after your bottom surgery you might know how she feels missing that part of a person she seems to love deeply. I’d say she associates who you are with what you got going on downstairs. 

Edit: added sentence two
Its your body. Do what makes you happy with it.
You need to do what makes you happy, but you need to prepare for the relationship to end. It's a very difficult decision you are facing, and I am sorry.
i mean, if you were the top it changes sex a lot... maybe get a dildo modeled after your penis to use with a strap on?
Sounds like a potential relationship halter. Have you asked if she's willing to talk it out? And if you do talk it out, I'd recommend establishing some boundaries for that convo first.
It isn't about her, it's about you and your wellbeing
I feel like you need someone who doesn't just support you half way..she's expecting you to put her happiness over your own. She's expecting you to put her happiness over you becoming who you truly want fully and I don't think its right for your partner to hold you back like that. It's selfish. I couldn't imagine doing that to mine. He isn't sure as of yet if he wants to fully transition but I will always support his decision 100 percent what ever it is. I've even done research on the bottom surgery and send him things I find because I'm want him to be happy and comfortable in his own body. I would never expect him to put my happiness over his (not that I'd be unhappy if he transitioned, I honestly don't mind).
I don’t understand that mindset. She should be happy for you that you’re going to feel more comfortable. I’ve been lucky to have a very supportive gf, and she’s always pretty much said “I don’t hate the parts of your body you do, because I don’t feel the dysphoria you feel, but I love when you feel confident and feel comfortable so I love the changes you’ve made that make you feel that way and you definitely seem and look more you because of it” 

She doesn’t have to hate your natal junk, but she must love to see you feel excited and then more confident with the surgery that will make you feel more comfortable with your body and more aligned with yourself. Otherwise, y’all gonna need to have a talk cause that ain’t right if she doesn’t want you to feel more comfortable and secure in yourself.
People come and go in your life but the ones who truly love you, who are willing to embrace you for who you are throughout all the changes life brings - those are your real friends.

Your GF is within her rights not to accept you or to have an aversion to you with a vulva and vagina.  Whatever her issue is, it’s about her, not you.  

I don’t buy this narrative people use about us becoming “totally different people.” We are the same consciousness throughout our lives but in living life, that consciousness grows as it experiences change:  We age, we become scarred, we heal, and we grow.  I’m not the same version of myself at 52 that I was at 16, neither is my wife and yet somehow, we continue to work with life changes and love each other.
There are nonbinary options available for srs. I'm personally going to do that, because I was born intersex, but I think it's valid for anyone to choose to have both parts if that's how they want to be
I am a entry-level transgender living as male but do wear women’s garments under my clothes. I am on my journey to fulltime girl and was wondering from this post how does one know exactly what is best as far as bottom surgery? I know that there are many options
Not okay :( She should understand how many struggles you may have bacause of it instead of what she's gonna loose.
Personally I'd say that this decision is only yours ..

For me my choice stand where it is, I will be having my surgery this year. And I am extremly disphoric especially about that part of my body, I don't think I would ever truly consider my partner in that, because one of my biggest goals is to fianlly be rid of that part, but maybe that's just mr.
It's not up to her it's up to you. If she doesn't support maybe she's not the right person
Im not sure what the problem could be since she is bisexual however i will say that getting bottom surgery wont change who you are as a person. It exists to affirm you and make you feel comfortable in who you already are.
I think she’s seeing it as a part of you instead of it being a part that you hate. She doesn’t understand being trans so she doesn’t understand why you hate it so much, or maybe she does but doesn’t understand your “need” to get rid of it. Personally if I was you that would be a red flag for me… I’ve been in your gfs position before, and when my gf started transitioning I remembered thinking to myself “I’ll have to accept that maybe someday she’ll want that part of her to change, and that’s okay, because it’ll help her feel like a woman and her happiness is more important than our sex life”. That’s how she should be seeing it. Plus… there’s more than 1 way to have sex lol
That's one hell of a coffee table trinket.


(In all seriousness, that's a really nice idea).
That is a nice way to compromise
*dull sitcom laugh*
That's awful. I love it
That’s true and I mean she does accept that, it’s just that it makes her so depressed and upset and just I don’t get it. Like you said it’s okay that she isn’t 100% happy, but being almost 100% unhappy is so weird. Idek what she’s being rn, I feel so confused rn
Jammidodger and Shaaba is the type of love i want when i get married. They’re so good for each other..
They haven't been able to marry yet because covid :(
Yeah that’s true, sex is a huge thing for her so I think she’s really scared of the changes. I get that, but still her almost leaving me just feels so crazy. But for sure I think her and I need to talk more
No it’s not harsh, getting the surgery is something I need to do and I’m gonna do it no matter what but just not really having her support sucks. No your advice is helpful, even significant others shouldn’t get in the way of happiness
>Dude
Ya but why would a bi person have genital preference? Seems confusing to me
Sex is a huge part of relationships. I can love my partner deeply but if sex suddenly stopped being enjoyable that would cause a huge blow to happiness.
Imaging being transphobic on a trans subreddit smh
I think you might have your terms confused. 

Bisexual is about sexuality. Other sexualities are obviously gay, lesbian, pan, etc.

Cis/Trans are descriptors for gender not sexuality. 

Sexuality is about who you are sexually and romantically attracted to.

Gender on the other hand has nothing to even do with sexual or romantic relationships. It's just about whether someone's assigned gender at birth matches with how they are now.
Right?? I love them so much. It’s why I like using them as an example for a couple who seems to be truly happy together.
Ah that’s so sad!
i’m glad you’re aware that she shouldn’t hold that power over you. i hope you somehow get to talk it out with her because you deserve to be happy with your body.
Hey, Cali. I'm sorry for calling you dude, I had no bad intentions,  it's just what I do. I can edit the comment if you'd like?
I call everyone dude. I use it as a gender neutral term.
Lol k
People grieve for all sorts of changes in their lives. Just because op’s gf is grieving doesn’t make her anti trans or not supportive, calling that transphobia is watering down the word.
Someone should make a movie of their love, it would be awesome
I do as well (it's like my main casual term lol) but only if i know the person I'm talking to is okay with that, if anyone expresses otherwise, it's a no-go, which for a lot of transfem people, it's not ok.
Sure thing, gal
Maybe you should learn not to? Even if you don't mean anything by it, it can still hurt the people you interact with. I know I don't want to be called dude...
It is incredible to me how empathy and normal human emotions are getting labeled transphobic in this whole thread
Lightbulb moment
Okay, but she didn't express distaste towards it. In fact, she didn't say anything about it. I'm sorry that's how I am, but I don't see why everyone is saying that. I would've gladly corrected myself if she asked me to, but she didn't. It kind of makes me upset that I'm being told this by someone who's not Op. I'm a trans man, and don't care if people call me ""girl"". I'm really dysphoric most days, and it still doesn't affect me. I'm really sorry that I assumed others were the same. But, I still think it's kind of annoying that you corrected me for her, without even seeing if she's upset. If she tells me directly, I'll change the comment. And I guess I'll change how I speak. (Non of this is meant to be seen as rude, I mean it as nicely as possible)
It's hard to tell tone on the internet, but if this is meant to be offensive, it's not lol. I hear people call everyone girl, also

My school wants to stop me from using the correct bathroom AND I’M PISSED	"I’m a 16yo trans guy. I’m sort of stealth, and don’t really like telling people I’m trans. But still, there’s people who know. The ones who met me before coming out, my friends and the teachers. My classmates treat me well and even sometimes forget I’m trans lol, it’s cool.

So, like a month ago I began using the men’s restroom at my school. For a long time I was scared of doing it, but my boyfriend convinced me that nobody would care, and he insisted that I pass well enough to not get into trouble with possible transphobes. So I just started doing it, and yeah literally no one cared, or so I thought.

Today my year’s coordinator took me out of class to talk with me. He told me that the school managers and staff had noticed me entering the men’s restroom and wanted me to “use the correct bathroom.” Apparently they had also received complaints from some guys two years older than me about how I made them “uncomfortable” being there.

They don’t want to make THEM uncomfortable so I was being told that I can’t use the men’s restroom anymore. WHAT THE FUCK.

The coordinator asked me if I was okay with this and of course I told him I’m not. He said he would try to reason with the school managers and the conversation ended with that. I felt like shit. I was pissed and sad and just felt terrible. My boyfriend was there to comfort me, but I still felt really bad.

Later when school was almost over he talked with me again and told me that I’m now only allowed to use the single gender neutral bathroom in school, which is the ones teachers use. I guess this is better then being sent to the women’s restroom, but it still feels shitty. My boyfriend by this time was already really pissed and went with one of my friends to talk with the coordinator. The only response they got was that this was a temporary solution until they figure out what to do about me.

I’m so sad and pissed and feel like shit. My friends are also angry. This is just so stupid, I literally am not doing anything to make people uncomfortable, wtf.

I am now at home and feeling really bad. I’m just not going to use the bathroom at school anymore. I hate this. It’s things like this that make me hate being trans."	"Y'all need to protest, talk to local LGBT organizations.
Where you at? Country/state? Depending on the local the admins could be within the law or they could be unknowingly breaking the law
Fuck em do it anyway. Hit them with the ""idk about your right wing bathroom politics I'm just taking a piss m8""
You want me to be your mom and call the school??? Seriously. Why arent your parents yelling the school down about this?
Are you in the U.S.? I’ve always felt that banning someone based on gender is a federal violation. Gender discrimination, but who has the money to sue?
the discomfort of bigots is not  a legitimate reason  forthe case by  case application , as a proportionate means of  achieving a legitmate aim    by  exclusing someone with the Protected Characteristic of Gender Reassignment    
sounds like these silly boys have just outed themselves to  management  as  clear safeguarding risks
If its making people “uncomfortable”  just go the extra mile. Next time someone says something look them in eye and start peeing on them. Never breaking eye contact and ask if they feel uncomfortable then.
Honestly, idk Mexican law (seeing from your earlier comment) but if you legally can, continue using the mens bathroom anyways. If you are doing something perfectly legal then they can't do anything per men at against it. (Also read the school's official policy as well, because if there is nothing in there about being trans & bathrooms and they do try and suspend you, then you can pull it up and rub it in their face to prove they are wrong, and (at least where I live, again check with Mexican law first) they can't change school policy mid-year without a public announcement to all students, parents, and staff, in which case you will have advance warning if they try and punish you.
Where are you from? If you're from the UK, by law you are allowed to use your preferred bathroom. It's worth looking up your local laws and rules on the matter. Good luck!
I can’t give legal advice and honestly am not well versed enough on trans bathroom cases in particular to confidently be able to give solid advice anyways but if you are in the U.S., I would think that G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board and the supreme court’s denial of cert (leaving the lower court decision in tact) pretty much clears up that the school can’t prohibit you from using the bathroom that correctly corresponds with your gender without violating title ix (unless the school is exempt from title ix) and unconstitutionally infringing on your rights under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. But again, I can’t give legal advice so I may be mistaken. I would strongly recommend however that if the school tries in anyway to further prohibit you from using the proper restroom that you seek out the services of an attorney or at least throw some of the above jargon at the school and threaten to seek out the services of an attorney. I would definitely make sure the school isn’t title ix exempt first before doing any of that shit though. Again, none of this should in anyway be construed as legal advice, I only recommend you seek out an attorney should issues persist.

Id still go in the crapper and tell that teacher to suck it. I had a similar issue a couple if years ago but now it doesn’t bother me. Im sure theres a way to escalate this to the school board or something
that sucks dude, at leaast people have your back, i hope the school sees reson, good luck
FUCKING BULLSHIT honestly you deserve to be treated with the same respect as anyone else. have they ever thought about how uncomfortable YOU would be having to use the other bathrooms? guess not. i'm so sorry, bro that sucks so much
WHO WANTS TO START A REVOLUTION!!!!
I live in Baja California, Mexico. I don’t really have a lot of knowledge when it comes to the law here, might be a good idea to check if they are breaking the law by doing this.
It’s actually not a federal protection yet. Many states have added to the discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression but at the federal level it is not a specific protection. That is exactly why so many people here are having trouble with crap like this.
They responded to another comment about how they live in Baja California Mexico
I do believe they mean stealth as in they look like a dude since their transmasc
Look at his profile you're just totally off in the weeds here very unhelpful attitude about it anyways though

is it bad that i’m technically transphobic to myself?	"ive always thought since i learned the term genderfluid that i could be genderfluid, but, ive always told myself that im just saying that. that im not actually who i am, im just saying that because i want to be special (this is a big problem for me without gender/sexuality questioning). so i just can’t stop crying before i sleep almost every night because i hate that i don’t know because i want to know. this doesn’t even summarize all my self hate and all, but this is the most i want to say currently.


i need some answers, at least 1. please and thank you.


edit: the support im getting is almost overwhelming and i almost started to cry because of how many people actually go through the same thing (crying because it’s sad that that’s normal but also happy because people understand what it’s like). although this doesn’t solve everything, its made me feel a little better today.

internalized transphobia, or also imposter syndrome are experienced by many of us transfolks. it doesn't say anything about how ""bad of a person you are"". its actually quit the opposit.

i would love to ask you one question: do you feel genderfluid or trans or whatever when you are alone with yourself? 😉 there you got your answer.

My beautiful person, this is a whole process. i started of as genderfluid. and i am now fully trans.
dont beat yourself up.
It's ok and normal to feel like this.

thoughts like ""am i doing this for attention?"" are typical imposter syndrome thoughts. you are not alone
It's bad for your well being but it doesn't mean you are a bad person.

That said - welcome to the club.
Welcome to the club!
I wouldn't say transphobic, even internalized. Sounds way more of the self doubt ""imposter syndrome"" that so many feel. There's no real hard test one can easily do to confirm your identity, so it's easy to doubt. 

I started feeling this way once I started coming out, as I was now more relaxed with myself. I was no longer feeling the anxiety I associated with being trans, and because of that loss of anxiety I started to think I wasn't actually trans. I'm still having to remind me that it was a temporary sensation, not a defining symptom. 

You are who you are. It'll take time to fully grasp that, and it may always cause doubt. But that's ok.
I was for many years against trans, I was a hot looking lesbian who didn’t understand why people would transition. Now I am a little over a year on T and post top surgery. Never been more happy. I think I was trying to convince myself that I wasn’t trans by hating trans. That obviously didn’t work. I was unhappy and miserable. Now finally I can say I’m free and I love and accept myself.
I have that thought, that I'm just trying to be special or something and should accept being 'boring' or 'normal'. Then I remind myself of two things- 

One- I'm already special, I'm a living warm organism in cold space, so really I can do whatever I want within that umbrella.

Two- when cis/stable trans people want to make themselves feel special or unique, it's usually like- a hobby or something? Something empowering- not something that makes them cry all the time when they ignore it. So probably this isn't a thing about specialness and more a thing about factness. 

You'll get there!

&#x200B;

(Still waiting to meet a maverique so I can ask them how it feels because the word won't leave my head...)
i too have the same issue (i am genderfluid as well) and i feel like i'm a faker or a trender, or that i want to be special somehow- it was really really bad a few months ago but i have it under control now. this was because i have the internalisation that non binary genders are not real. but its not true. non binary genders are very real and i experience it myself; so do many others. dont give in to enbyphobia.

i wouldnt say its bad per se.. its just detrimental to your own mental health and may lead you down a path of transphobia if you ponder too much on it. It has really ruined my mental health and i still feel ashamed to openly declare myself to be genderfluid (because of all the harassment and mockery we face) which i am working on to get rid of. No one should have to feel this way. Just try to get rid of those feelings, by knowing that you are truly trans and truly the gender that you are.

It may be a tough journey but there is light at the end of the tunnel. It will keep decreasing- thats the only way it can go now. One day, you will stop being so cruel to yourself.

Sincerely,

A person who struggled with a lot of trans imposter syndrome and still does.
Yeah I feel like every trans person struggles with accepting themselves at some point. I think it's rare to just know exactly what you're doing and never doubt yourself or let internalized transphobia make you feel bad.
Well... internalized transphobia is a hell of a demon to restle with sometimes.
Its not bad…….
 
………………………Its not good either
Internal transphobia is a problem but the best is to try to work through it and slowly break though those thoughts. I have internal sexism towards men but now that im a man and im older im trying to fix it, its always good to try your best to understand people and learn.
Don't tell yourself that you are a bad person, there is nothing wrong with not knowing who  you are, and those who do it to feel special don't have the thoughts of ""doing it to feel special"" And they don't feel guilty for it, so don't associate yourself with them. 

Moreover we are not born with a story or an identity, we create our identity as we go through life. 

It's sad that society have conditioned us in such a way that we question ourselves for being who we are.
soooo many of us have internalized transphobia, it's not uncommon. it's super hard to break out of it, but positive reinforcement helps a ton! friends groups, supports groups, anyone who brings you up so long as they're not being predatory or toxic while doing it
Aren’t we all a little transphobic towards our self
that's called internalised transphobia and it's something we all have/had to learn to get rid of. It's more of a reflection of how unkind society is to us than of the kind of person you are
That is very normal, don't worry.  I havent met any trans person that doesnt experience this
It's bad because you don't deserve it, but that doesn't mean you're a bad person. Society is a whore to us nb folks and that rubs off on us.
Oh, me too, but then I slap myself in the face (actually) and say ""cut that shit out, you're better than that!""
Its bad for you nut not bad in general. In fact, welcome to the club lol
Read about imposter syndrome with trans people. It's quite common.
internalized transphobia is something that almost all of us have to deal with originally, even if we don't realize it or don't believe we have it. It takes time to get over but i promise you can get over it. there are times where one may be overwhelmed with imposter syndrome and constantly questioning ""am i faking it?"" but i assure you, you're probably not faking it. would a cis person really go through all the stuff you go through, constantly questioning their gender and not being comfortable/being more comfortable as a different gender. if you really are just doing it for attention, how does that explain you feeling better as a different gender. whenever you have the thought of are you faking it or not, think if the things that have made you very sure you are trans/genderfluid.
Bad to accept? Yes. Keep introspecting.

Are you bad? No, you are normal.
[deleted]
Also genderfluid. Also do this.
I'm a trans man but tell myself I'm a cis man because I hate being trans so much. I just want to be like all the other boys.
“Everyone is valid except me” is quite common among trans people. Don’t sweat it.
>My beautiful person, this is a whole process. i started of as genderfluid. and i am now fully trans. dont beat yourself up. It's ok and normal to feel like this.

Aren't genderfluid people non-binary and therefore fully trans?
>i started of as genderfluid. and i am now fully trans.

For me it was ""just crossdressing"" -> genderfluid -> trans


>thoughts like ""am i doing this for attention?"" 

This is super relateable, along with other classics such as ""am I just making it all up?"" and ""is this just in my head?""
omg thank you so much this cheered me up a lot!
haha glad to be here :,)
The self hate is because when we were young, we were taught to hate transgender people. We didn’t tell anyone we were, because we would be hated. Which very easily turns into self hate. 

If you can put the self hate aside, and just try thinking of yourself as the other gender. Are you happy? Is that happiness able to thrive without a lifetime of self hate?
omg thank you so much
that is super awesome for you!
my mom asked that question, which was a good question, and i found a way to address it (im making a book!). buttt the bad thing about the question is that ive been having a identity crisis since for everything :,D
this.
this is my LIFE
thank you :)
oh ive been trying to for a while
Non-binary people do not necessarily feel 100% trans or even trans at all. For example, a demi-girl AFAB person may not feel trans at all or just partly-trans because their gender is somewhat linked to their AGAB. Same for genderfluid people, some may always feel trans, some may only feel this way on moments when their gender feel different from their AGAB while not feeling trans the rest of the time, etc.
Technically, but we all make mistakes when typing and also I'm guessing this person came from a place where everyone was ignorant to trans people so we gotta cut them some slack but to be fair I'm not gender fluid nor non binary so I may have a flawed idea of how non binary and gender fluid minds work.so don't take my words as fact
yes we are fully trans.
yes we are fully trans.
> For me it was ""just crossdressing"" -> genderfluid -> trans

I'm at the genderfluid part, but worried I may be in denial.  I have tons of questions in my head similar to yours, but also: ""am I having a mid life crisis/gone crazy/somehow programmed myself/some unknown head injury/ hormone dysfunction from being on Testosterone too long/ etc.
I'm glad you posted this. I am also at the genderfluid stage, I've been hella questioning myself as well. Just recently found out I'm autistic, with some possible trauma. Learning how to understand my brain and soul better. Double masking is super tough.
Not everyone was brought up to hate trans people, because for a lot of kids, it isn’t even on their radar.
I have a friend who wrote a novel, and by the end of it his entire worldview was changed because he'd addressed so many things about his identity he'd never thought about. It's a strong medicine! 

I feel that crisis though. I think that's why I became a clown- can't have a crisis if the answer to every question is ""I'm just a silly lil' thing""
😅
hey friend- here's an article that helped me in my journey of slowly overcoming it (which i still am trying to do):

[https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/impostor-syndrome](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/impostor-syndrome)

and here is a video discussing it, made by a clinical psychologist. i assure you that it will put you at peace:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfgt0Z8BFB8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfgt0Z8BFB8)
personally, i do feel trans all of the time (as a non-binary and genderfluid person) despite me having days where my gender is the same my AGAB (which is very rare, maybe 1 time out of 10, but significant enough)
I have a question then. Can people who are not linked towards their AGAB feel not trans? Because I am someone that don't feel trans and could get dysphoria from the whole AGAB thing. It makes me lesser valid (it's the whole connection of the gender I am not that makes me feel that way) but I feel like the gender I am not assigned with in a cis kind of way. Like it feels that it is the gender that I am assigned with. Though same with all the genders I could experience it in a cis kind of way and it makes me euphoric
sorry ma native language is not english. i tried to cheer this person up
For me it took about half a year from coming out as genderfluid to admitting I am trans. I noticed afterwards there was little fluidity happening and the fluidity that did happen was more towards the feminine end. Couple that with the fact that I asked my wife (cisF) to use she/her pronouns for me and it literally gave me butterflies in my stomach and well, the obvious conclusion was right there. Still took me 4 months from that point to accept myself as trans though.
chefs kiss
Genuine question; how do you know you ""feel"" trans? For me, I don't feel trans I just feel like a guy who has the incorrect body.
its alright friend! i understand. what you said was very correct and reassuring too. even i am not a native speaker, so dont worry- your comment cheered me up as well :)
I feel trans for a similar reason, but not entirely. I have a yearning and a strong desire to be seen as a man, to be referred to as a man, to look like a man; a man who sometimes dabbles in femininity. 

However, this desire is not in the way that a binary trans man would have; i don't have bottom dysphoria (once in a while i tend to fantasize how it would be if i had a penis, but i don't want it forever), i don't want to be fully seen as a man in the binary sense; and sometimes my gender fluctuates to that of a woman. 

It's hard to fully explain why I'm not a binary man... I'm just not binary-gendered for a multitude of reasons. I am a non-binary trans man; that fits perfectly for me- it feels right. After months of knowing how i feel but lacking a label, i found comfort in calling myself a non-binary man; which also has room for encompassing my genderfluidity.

EDIT: i missed a part of your question. I use ""feel like a guy"" and ""feel trans"" interchangeably 😅 that's what i meant. Saying ""i feel trans"" for the comment that i was replying to, felt more appropriate and understandable than saying ""i feel like a guy"" because there are genderfluid people who have different levels of gender fluctuations

I wish I was born a girl, and I absolutely despise being a guy. I Don't want to transition.	"I'm a 16(M),

I've been experiencing fucking devastating feelings the last few years, wishing I was born a girl.

I Feel like if I transitioned, I would never feel complete, or 'real'. I don't think I want to transition. These feelings have led me to be extremely depressed all the time. 

Every time I see a pretty girl, in public, online, etc, I just think: ""I wish I was you"" or ""I wish I was born like you"". and it completely ruins my mood for the day. I just feel this deep..sadness and extreme disappointment. deeper than I've ever felt before.

It's the single worst feeling I have ever experienced, and it's been getting a lot worse over the last year. it's gotten so bad that I now use weed and alcohol a few times a week to suppress my feelings. I just can't fucking take it anymore man. I haven't told anyone I know.

My sexuality has shifted a lot the last few years, from gay to bi, etc. (Including crossdressing, femboy, etc.) but I always come to the same conclusion; I fucking hate myself, and everything about being a guy. 

I sometimes just think of ending it all, and hoping there's a next life where I can be born a girl. stupid, I know. 

I have read a response often given: ""you're still young, just wait a bit:"" but I just can't. it's too much. I know my only option is to just accept myself, but I just don't know how, and I feel like I never can, and will always be unhappy.

I know this subreddit is meant for positive vibes and such, so I'm sorry for ruining that. I just desperately need advice.

regards."	"I’m 16 MtF, I’m just starting my transition and in the past I had the same feelings, however even just starting has made me 1000 times happier than I’ve ever felt in my entire life. I’ve been miserable for the past decade with crippling anxiety and depression, I’ve been extremely underweight and I have I have terrible unexplained sensory issues. I thought I would never be happy and that I should just end it and hope that I would be reborn as a girl despite being as atheist and secular as you can get. I used to think that it would feel ‘fake’ but now that I’m doing something my life has never felt more real. My advice is to do something small, like paint your nails. Then see how it makes you feel.
I’m 29 FtM and I felt like you do now as far back as 12 years old, except you know being envious of guys. I didn’t know about transgender until I was 20 and at that point I was so brainwashed by conservative parents that I was just depressed all the time. Let me tell you that transitioning has been the best decision for me. I had to wait until it was safe to do so. You’ve got love and support from your online brother here.
Will confirm, transitioning and embracing yourself will, at the very worst, make you less unhappy.

But on a more positive note, it could help you actually start to love yourself.
Everyone has doubts about their transition. It's something you can never know before you start. However, here's something to think about.

What would be worse: feeling the way you do now for the rest of your life, or transitioning and it not turning out quite the way you wanted? 

Personally, I'd say being a girl of any kind, even if it doesn't fit to the mental image of what I'd like to look like, is better than suffering every day.

My biggest advice is to just talk to someone though. If you have a therapist, that's probably a good place to start. If not, maybe a friend or family member you really trust and can keep a secret. Just getting those feelings out into the open will make everything feel more real and will really help you feel better, even if it's just telling one person.
We unfortunately don't get to choose the body we're born in, but we get to choose how to customize it. It takes some mighty willpower not to wallow is self-pity, but ultimately it's worth it. There is still so much you can do, I wish I'd started transitioning at 16 and not at 28, but you gotta make the best of what you've been dealt and focus on that. No regrets.
First off, hun: I think you should speak with a therapist about this matter. It's clearly causing mental anguish and causing your mental health and well being to decline, so discussing this with a professional would probably help you manage these negative feelings. I know it helped me a ton to help me understand myself, as well as manage my Depression and Anxiety.

Having said that, I think you might not be fully informed on what ""Transitioning"" means or could mean. 

You don't have to physically transition of you don't want to. You can socially transition if you want: just change your name, or your pronouns, or both. You don't have to do surgery right away, or go onto HRT immediately. Hell, a therapist likely wouldn't even put you on that until they are 100% certain it would be the best for you (these types of things takes a lot of time). 

I found for me, exploring and testing the waters a bit with different things made me more and more comfortable with understanding who I was and discovering my true self. You can start small, take baby steps, and see what you like and dislike. 

Exploring yourself and coming to blossom into your true sense of self is not ""being fake"" or ""not real"", if anything, it's the opposite! You **are** being true to yourself. You are doing what makes **you** happy, and that's ultimately the thing that matters most. 

Wear what you want; do what you want; be who you want to be. 

You have so much to live for, and while things might be hard, there are people in your life here to support you. Hell, all of us here on the subreddit are happy to give you encouragement and support in whatever way we can and that you need it c: You just have to keep taking baby steps forward. 

You got this: you can do this! We all believe in you. 

**I believe in you** 💜💜💜
Believe it or not, if you start transitioning now, you'll actually be happy and feel real.

I've had the feelings you have since I was 18. I tried sweeping it under the rug but the feelings were too intense and too persistent. I made it to 32 before I started transitioning, at which point I just couldn't bear being male anymore. If there's one thing I regret, it's not transitioning sooner. If there's one thing I'm surprised by, it's how good I still feel despite never being able to be as female (for lack of better word) as I would have if I started sooner.

You either wish you did it, or you did it.
When I was your age, I bottled everything up. To be fair, I didn't know what a trans person actually was. It took me until 20 to realize anything was wrong, a few years to realize what it was, another to admit it to myself, and yet another to tell anyone about it.

If you bottle it up, you'll still have to face it later. It's much safer to deal with it without letting dysphoria fester. If you want something simple, play with the pronouns you use, get a few sets of clothing that make you look less masculine, and try makeup.

I see that you're open to therapy. It took me a couple of therapists to find one I actually could be open with. Once I found one, they were able to help me process what I was feeling. It was the best thing I've done in years.

It honestly sounds like presenting as your agab is no longer an option. Do you have peers to go to irl? A school lgbtq+ group maybe?
Something that helped me early on was realizing that after I accepted myself as a woman, I realized that I already have a woman's body. Yes there are things I still want to change but just changing my clothes, growing my hair out, shaving my face, shaping my eyebrows and maybe some mascara make so much of a difference that the things that still bother me are very manageable.
Going to be as blunt an honest as I can be but pls hear me out. This feeling will not go away, I was in the same spot you were at 17, telling myself transition wouldn't help and I'd never be ""real"". Took me six more years to come around but truthfully it's transition or literally ending it, I wouldn't have lasted another month if I hadn't transitioned when I did and I put it off for this long for what, nothing but my own fears and trepidations. I've literally never felt this real or like an actual person before, I can look in the mirror for longer than 5 seconds and not freak out. Take advantage of your age I know so many of us wish we had. Starting that young the possibilities will astound you . Good luck I hope you find peace sooner rather than later <3
Yeah....sums up my whole life.  Recently realizing I don't even care anymore.  Transwomen are REAL women.  We may never have ""perfect"" cis bodies....but I can't keep going pretending to be a man.  That's way scarier than knowing my vagina will not work exactly like a cis girl's does.
First thing to say, you need to find a therapist.  No *not saying your broken*!   Sounds like you don't understand yourself yet.  A therapists will help!   Important!  Look for that specializes in transgender/gay/bi/non-binary.  This will help.  Suggest to not go to a religion based therapist.  They do not look at the issue in physical terms as the source.  

Would also suggest your hotline for your country.  

I have had these feelings all my life.  Subconsciously at first.  Consciously since around 12-14.   I buried and ran from these feelings.  40 years have past, now 52. Point there is, I wasted those years.  Was a zombie.  Never really living, never happy.  

You are never too young to address who you are!!!

Talk with a therapist, they can help you learn to deal with these feelings.  They can help you accept yourself!   Be as honest and open *as you can, and still be comfortable*.  It is okay to push yourself seeking help!  But do not *force yourself* beyond your comfort level.  Allow your self to relax.
i WISH i had the opportunity to have transitioned at 16
Hey friend, I don't have any advice, and I'm a cis woman, so I have no idea what you're going through. I just want to say that what you described here, sounds really terrible for you! I can see why you're in agony; that sounds unbearable. It's okay to feel this way. 

What you're going through is real and I know you are not alone. Someone very close to me identifies as genderqueer and started transitioning but aren't sure where they are going to eventually end up along the gender spectrum. No two experiences are the same, but it's perfectly okay to not have it figured out yet. Just get through the day. 

Take it one day at a time. Do what makes you happy that day. Every day that you get out of bed, just focus on finding anything to enjoy about that day. You got this.
I'm 15yo and I'm is almost your same situation... Stay strong sister, life will probably get better for both of us ♥️...
I'm 29. Just started transitioning MTF 4 months ago.  


All I can say to comfort you friend is to realize that the most important thing in life is to live your truth and be who you are on the inside on the outside.  


Sending virtual hugs from someone that was you... many years ago. <3
Like how will man made vagina compare to a born one that is my biggest sadness. I don't think they will ever be the same. I will just like to at least wear underwear without a bulge.
Stay strong hun. I’ve been there and started HRT last year at 23. Your safety is important and if your home life gives you bad vibes about coming out; then wait until you feel safe. I wanted to transition in middle school and know exactly what you’re talking about. It’s tough! 

Since starting HRT I feel 100000x better about myself. Deep down you know yourself better than anyone else. If you keep circling being trans, you’re likely trans… at least in my personal experience.
That’s how I feel, I’m very broad shouldered and I know that no matter what I’m never going to look the way I do in my mind. I don’t want to spend my life being constantly targeted because it’s obvious that I’m trans
Just transition I know you don’t want to but if you really feel like this your best option is to at least try and transition because for all you know it could work (ps when mentioning sexuality you said “from gay to bi,to crossdresser,femboy etc” well crossdresser and femboy aren’t sexuality’s :))
I've often wondered what my life would be like if I was born female, since I'm not, I chose to transition to female
I'm so sorry that you feel this way. I know there are hormonal treatments available. Maybe try seeing a gender therapist. These things are important to discuss with people in order to better understand your feelings. Try reaching out to a close friend or family member. I hope you feel better about yourself. I know it's difficult but try not to take yourself as seriously and just go with the flow a bit until you can find something that works. Please talk to someone if you ever get a little bit too depressed. They will help you.
Seems to me that suicide is a far more drastic conclusion than transition. Why not try transitioning first?

My experience with transition is that it hasn't completely resolved my gender dysphoria, but I do feel like a woman and get treated like one most of the time and that's a damn sight better than none of the time.
I too, twice your age struggle with almost the same feeling.  
It's still your life and just be what you can be I guess... I hate my penis, my body, and being called sir makes my skin crawl.  
I hope you find a way to be comfortable with living.  
<3
!remindme 1 year
Exactly my same situation except you are a year older than me. If you want to talk my dm's are open, I'm a good listener :)
It’s 1000% perfectly normal to experience lots of dysphoria and to be honest it will most likely not go away. Like even years down the line when people recognize you as a girl. Several of my friends still have lots of dysphoria, I do as well. Well start having a sudden bout of it and then cry for a few weeks, but dont take that to mean that that nothing will get better. I feel better most days and I can actually look myself in the mirror now. Just because things will never be as great as they could be doesn’t mean you shouldn’t at least strive to be a little bit happier in life.
Please don’t hurt yourself and don’t use drugs or anything to cover this over. To me it sounds like it’s obvious you’d probably benefit from hrt, if you can’t do it mow, then later. And if you were going to hurt yourself anyway, then no reason not to try. 
 Ugh, I wish I knew what to say and I just don’t want you to hurt yourself in any way 😕
I mean, sure, your transition is never truly over, but the more open and like the you in your head, the easier it becomes because you worry less. Everyone has something about themselves they don't like. We're lucky because we know exactly what that is, but unlucky that it's such a massive process.

Keep going, friend, and whatever you do decide to do, I hope it makes you happy.
TW: Suicide

I’m a 19 y.o AMAB trans nb here. Was the same as you with 16, except for the gay part: thought I was straight boy before questioning gender and the suicide hole because of wishing to be a girl without the whole part of living through it.

Wish you could tell it to a friend or someone you can really trust. I regret not doing it, because when you act like what you’re feeling is real you actually start to learn how to cope with it.

Suppressing feelings and wishing death will only make it worse. 

Maybe the only way to live a meaningful life when you wish to be the other gender is to accept what you’re living through.
I recall thinking many of those same things. I thought when I was a teenager I'd never have to courage to do what I am going through now. I'm having GCS in a week and never thought I'd get to this point. I hated myself through much of my early adulthood because I didn't have to courage to do what I had to do to be myself. It's not something I'd ever wish on anyone. 

I'm willing to bet most everyone in this sub has felt fake or like they would be lesser than a cis woman if they transitioned. Really this is not true, you're simply a different kind of woman with different parts. Self doubt is a natural part of life and dysphoria makes it even worse. I can say that it gets better but really it only gets so if you want it to. It takes a lot of fucking effort and I guess that's why most of us hate being trans, right? Because it takes massive effort on our part to be who we actually are. I know I have odds with mother nature for that reason. I just want to have a vagina and not have to be tied to the pharma industry for my life. My best advice? Figure out who you are and be that woman.
I would highly suggest seeking out a gender therapist who has a background in lgbtq+ (WPATH) etc. on psychologists today and that gender therapist should be able to help you work through what you're feeling on a productive level, and hopefully through application. You are valid, girl. You are strong, stronger than you know and you will make it through this. If you need to talk to anyone I'm here.
It took me a long time to come out. I thought there was absolutely no possible way I could be trans. Well, I was wrong. Even if it doesn't seem like it would solve all your problems, if transitioning has even the slightest chance of making you into a less suicidal person, do it. Otherwise, seek therapy. I know its hard. I know you want to die. I know. It's the shittiest, most horrible feeling. But please, keep going forward.

You don’t have to transition — what matters is what your identify as.
i can't give advice cuz as a trans guy i feel so much like this, but im really sorry u feel this way

heres a snail to cheer u up tho 🐌
I feel the exact same, but in reverse. 

I have no advice. I don't know what to fucking do either. But we are not alone ❤️
You might be working off of misinformation on how well you will pass.

Did you know (anecdotal) some gynaecologists struggle to tell the difference? (at least until they can't find a cervix, but then many cis women have had hysterectomies)
I don't know how true that is, but if somebody's not a gyno they would have issues clocking you.
After healing, they look great! (many photos are still during healing)

I know vaginoplasties might not be all you're worried about, but there's a lot of misinformation about that in particular.
I'd say the vagina is the closest thing to a giveaway (given it's made from... y'know...) but even it won't give you away. 
You WILL be like every other girl. You won't be a fraud.

If you are experiencing dysphoria it's best to address it right now- given you are still in puberty. 

I think speaking to a psychologist would be a good first course-of-action. Make sure to seek a trans-supportive one.

Good luck!
I am 23 years old, came out to just myself and my girlfriend at the time when I was 17 and felt super similar to how you feel. Coming to terms with being trans and what that entailed was one of the hardest thing I have ever done, and hell, the early parts of my transition where I was trying insanely hard to pass just to fail were even more incredibly frustrating.

BUT, I now 100% pass everyday and even had my first lesbian experience last night and I have never, ever, been happier, more fulfilled, and more full of self love than how I feel right now. All of those hardships were 100% worth it and then some to get to where I am now. I know it's the freaking scariest thing on earth to consider transitioning, but it is more than worth it. A life span is a long time, your 16 and you have many, many years ahead of you to live in your own skin, I know its hard but try to come to terms with that and think about what that would be like if you didn't transition.

What always helped me get through, was thinking all of the positive happy things that would come with a successful transition. I thought at the time that it would be just to live a normal life and be who I want to be, but now I've realized it's something even more. It's not just a normal life, it's a freaking amazing one. Once you get there, the happiness and fulfillment you will feel will be like nothing you have ever experienced and it will feel like the first day of your life once you have experienced that.

Take your time, come to terms with what it means to be trans and most importantly, try to hold onto hope and positivity. There's a lot of hard stuff about transition and being trans but it's a journey and at the end of the road the destination is like nothing you could ever imagine. 
Anyways, I wish you the best of luck and hope things get better for you💕
Thinking transitioning doesn’t make you “real” is some internalized transphobia you need to unpack with a gender therapist. It’ll help a lot to talk to a professional!!! At least then you’ll know for sure that it is or isn’t what you want with clear direction and guidance.
I totally understand. I was like you a few years ago. I thought it was awfully difficult to transition and just went on with myself wanting to be a girl in maybe a next life.

 And then a Facebook friend of mine started transitioning. Seeing her becoming more and more feminine and better in her own skin over the months broke my egg.

I learnt that transitioning wasn't that difficult. Of course it is, but worth it. I had went to a point where I had to chose between transitioning and just spiraling down into self-hate and depression. That was close, really.

I was worried about never feeling complete. Never feeling real. And I still am sometimes. It's part of the transphobia we all internalized as children because we are not educated to accept trans people as normal. 

But trans people are not a failure, nor a monster. They just are who they are and like everyone else, some are great people, some are shitty. 

You may want to find a LGBT-friendly therapist. Because might definitely have gender dysphoria and understanding that it's okay to be yourself is the first step to self-acceptance

Anyway, you've made the good decision to come and talk with us.
thid is intensely internalised dysphoria. I cant really see any resolution aside from transitioning. If you're unsure about wanting to, try starting small in regards to gendered things, like presenting femininely. if you experience a euphoric sensation in opposition to how shitty you feel about gender normally, you're on the right track.
Come out now and get on HRT and your whole life is going to be that much easier down the line for it. I know it’s terrifying but if it’s what you want then you should do it.
Yo. So. Transitioning doesn't have to include hormones. You honestly just sound like a girl who feels out of place becusse you fit into the ""male"" aesthetic. 
   It's natural to feel sad about something like that tbh. To feel like theyre prettier than you. Or like you're out of place around them 

That's honestly a cis girl thought too. 
Being pretty enough doesn't make you a girl 

But to me it sounds like you might have some dysphoric feelings to sift through. 

Don't be afraid of change. Let it flow with you
The earlier you start your transition the better results you'll get. Look up Samantha Lux on YouTube, she transitioned at 18 and she looks stunning.

I didn't start till I was 24 even though the resources were technically available since I was 20 and I don't think I'll ever stop regretting not starting earlier.
i feel the same way except i want to transition, the problem is im living with people who i think are phobic.
Thanks alot for the advice. I have painted my nails black before, but i think i might just go and paint them some more. See how that makes me feel. I just feel like i can't just go right ahead and transition, even though i know no one in my circle would oppose it. I never really realised that i could be trans, i've seen so many other trans people, and it's always seemed so... distant.. yk?
Thanks so much :')
Thanks.. i'm just afraid that the feeling i get when looking at other biological women will never leave. Even after i transition.. it's just such an incredibly strong desire, you know?
Thanks so much for your response. I think i've been convinced today to take some steps and try to see a therapist. Thanks :)
Thanks so much. i think i might go ahead and take some steps. Mayne go to a therapist for a start. Thanks.
Thanks for the advice. ♥️♥️
Thanks alot for the advice ♥️♥️♥️
They work closely. Everybody is recommended to use a bit of lubrication anyway. 

I really hope our people can get perfect lab-grown vaginas one day though, but we are doing well for now.
Thanks alot for this! I think im going to try to see a therapist soon. Hope that helps 🙏🙏 thanks.
I still remember reading the word 'Estradiol' on a sponge (promotion item - mom was a nurse) at that age and feeling obsessed, desperate, idk what all. I would have eaten the sponge if it would have helped me.
Thanks ♥️
Hope so.♥️
♥️♥️♥️
Its just.. ""trans"" is such an immensely scary word, and such a frightening concept.. it was always so far away, something very few other individuals have. I just feel like i dont want te be transgender.. just want to be able to accept myself being a male.. being normal. I just.. can't?
♥️
I know crossdresser and femboy isnt a sexuality lol. I just added them in there for reference. Im just so scared i wouldnt feel real if i transitioned, and it'd only make me feel worse. Especially in the future.
Thanks alot for this advice. I think im going to try to see a therapist.

Thanks for the advice.. the problem i'm experiencing most atm, is.. i dont want to be transgender!!! I just want to be able to accept my male body, and being a guy.. i just can't no matter how hard i try... There are some moments where i just kind aforget about it and feel fine, but then i get reminded of it instantly when seeing a pretty girl. It sucks..
Thanks alot ♥️ i just have no idea where yo even start with a therapist. Ill see if i can find something..
Thanks alot ♥️♥️♥️
Thanks for the response ♥️♥️ i'll see if i can find a therapist.
Thanks for the snail ♥️🐌🐌🐌
Thanks♥️♥️
Thanks alot.. i have no idea where to start... I'll see if i can tell a close friend, or find a therapist.

Thing is: i dont want to be transgender!!! I just want to be able to accept my male body, and being a guy.. i just can't no matter how hard i try... There are some moments where i just kinda forget about it and feel fine, but then i get reminded of it instantly when seeing a pretty girl. It sucks..
Thanks so much for this comment. It really calmed me down.   Atm, i really feel like i dont want to be transgender, i just really want to be able to be normal... to be able to accept myself the way i am, but i just cant...
Thank for tue advicem i'll see if i can find a therapist or smth. ♥️♥️
Thanks so much♥️♥️♥️♥️
I'll try this. I have had black nails before, but i might start trying different things. Thanks ♥️
Have you told anyone about this feeling? For the longest time it existed only in head. Telling my mom and just letting the knowledge that I am trans exist outside of my own brain made it feel so much more real. I knew I was trans for 9 months before coming out and I was miserable for years.
You are so young! I have a similar story but just wasted a few more years not even considering that I could be trans. 26 now, wish I started younger

That being said - transition can be different for everyone. It’s helpful to me to not look at the big mountain of things I might want. But focus instead on what tangible small steps might feel good short term.
I used to feel that way, too! And I started my transition at 26! There are some timeline pics in my post history if it helps?
Oh. I know. Gender envy is always a thing. I experience it a lot, every day.

I can basically laugh about it with my partner at this point, not everyone can take it so well though. No need to be ashamed. 

You can't let it override your right to love yourself.
That sounds like dysphoria.  But a therapist would be better qualified to answer.  Address  issue. That will help address these feelings.
No problem! I hope it all goes well for you. Feel free to DM me if you ever need some support.
Thank you very much... This week was incredibly depressing and hard for me, but I'll keep fighting until the end Hahaha...
We'll you're 15. Unless you got really unlucky you'll probably have a good transiton 

If you're not on puberty blockers I'd say get on them asap. With what you're saying it sounds like you'll really regret it if you won't. 

Don't even get on E, just t blockers for the meantime 

(and before anyone says it's dangerous, it is, in fact, not dangerous. 5 months on only t blockers here, speaking from personal experience)
I'd be willing to bet that most trans people would rather not be trans if they. Would help it. It certainly is a struggle.
Look on Psychologytoday and try to find someone in the state you live in. So mine was a really roundabout way but I live near chicago so I tried Lifeworks which I highly recommend if you're in Chicago but they recommended me to someone else who recommended me to someone else who showed me a database of psychologists/therapists in my area. And honestly I got really lucky. The woman I'm working with now is a godsend.
Some people feel like that initially. I would still recommend undergoing transition, that sounds like comphet to me
I'm so happy to hear it helped you, and don't worry just give it some time. I spent about a year at least after realizing I was trans trans just considering all my options and whether I was sure or not before I 100% committed to myself that I was trans. It's a lot to take in and process, just take your time and I promise it will becomes less overwhelming slowly but surely. Also as just another tip, don't get caught up in the big picture, focus on small next steps once you start transitioning, it makes it less overwhelming and really helps progress.
No i haven't told anyone yet. It's been slowly brewing for years inside me though.. i want to tell people, but the problem is: i think i'm just really afraid of it becoming so real like you mentioned.
Thanks alot.. i didnt really know 'gender envy' was a thing. Just a feeling i had. Good to know im not the only one.. thanks so much :)
I wish I had done this when I had these feelings at 14, now I’m stuck at 24 debating hormones 😅 definitely worth taking blockers as soon  as possible
Thanks for responding. I really want to get on blockers, and i think my parents would be completely fine with it, its just.. it makes it so much more real you know? Ill do some research online on how i can get them. Do you think i could take them without people at school etc realising?
I see.. sadly im not in the US. I'm in the netherlands. I'll tey and find someone online, or atleast tell a close friend or something. 

The problem is: i just dont want to be trans. The word and concept of transgender is so scary.. it alsways was so distant, something very few individuals i've seen online have, you know? I just want to be normal andbe able to accept myself the way i am..
Thanks.. thats reassuring i guess.
Thanks alot ♥️♥️♥️
I 100% understand, only reason I came out was because my psychiatrist directly asked me. My mom asked me if I was transgender twice before and I lied both times. I’ve only been out for like 3 weeks and my life has gotten so much better already.
Please try to tell someone you trust. Even telling one person will take a huge weight off your chest. You're absolutely right to observe that keeping these thoughts bottled up inside will make you feel overwhelmed. I am also bi (well pan actually) and I felt horribly anxious about keeping it a huge secret even just for six months and when I finally came out to my only openly LGBT friend it felt like a huge relief. Perhaps you can relate to that and thereby understand the importance of coming out--not to everyone, not all at once--but at least to one person.
No problem, so happy help.
Yeah because blockers stop changes so they won’t notice anything
Yeah, t blockers only stop the effects of testosterone, they don't feminize you. No one will notice. And if they do you can say you're a late bloomer, or just a simple ""idk"".

The effects I've noticed so far are a lack of libido and hair growth slowing, both started in the first month. That's probably going to be everything. 

And yeah I know it's scary, but don't let it scare you!
With blockers only all they might notice is that you're not growing as much as they are. If you get E too then you might have some chance of getting a noticeable amount of growth after a month or 12 but at that point you might as well just be proud of your new boobies.
Oh i see. I'll see if i can tell my parents im incredibly confused, and just want to get on t blockers, just in case. They'll probably understand.
Thanks..i have a few friends i trust. I'll see if i can tell them what im going through.
♥️
Oh i see. Thanks. My voice has dropped a noticeable amount in the last year, and i definitely have an adams apple. Not huge though i think. I havent really started growing facial hair yet. You think they would still help?
Thanks so much. I'll look into getting some. I hope i can just buy them online or something, cause having to go to a therapist or smth for a prescription makes it all extremely real and very frightening..
I wish the best of luck to you, I hope you can live a happy life.
Wish you the best of luck
Damn wish I did that when I was younger lmao. 

A conversation is hard but living as a guy when you don't wanna is worse
You don't have to go into a lot of detail if you don't want to. You can just say that you're not really sure but you might want to try a different name or pronouns if they would be comfortable using them for you, or something like that.
Even if there have been some changes, it'll still be easier to deal with later if you *do* decide to transition than if you let puberty fully run it's course.

I understand the fear of acknowledging it making it ""more real."" You feel like you can hide it and everything will stay the same and be ""fine,"" but really it just builds and builds until you can't take it anymore. Accepting you are trans (if that is what you determine) is a *huge* change to your life, and is a big scary unknown. Our brains are wired to protect us from things like that, but it doesn't always know best.

I had that fear just months ago, and after the shock and fear of just *saying it* to someone I already started to feel so much better.

Whatever you decide, I hope it helps you
Don't quote me on this, but I think blockers can help until you hit 20. Getting on them early is kind of important for them to do much though.
I wouldn't recommend diy hrt, but if you're in the us you can get informed consent - look it up :)
Try this approach.  Talk to a therapist to address your feelings, fears, acceptance of yourself.  That does not mean you have made a decision to start T blockers or get on E etc.   if the flow of a few sessions help you relax, deal with anxieties, and accept yourself then that alone would be worth going to them.  That is the first step.  You don't have to make a decision yet for the second one.  First pull yourself together. Then look towards the second step!
Thanks so much :')
The same to you.
I see.. yeah i was thinking of just showing them my post. But i now think that might be a bit much...
Thanks so much for this response. I think ive been vonvinced today to take some steps. Try to see a therapist at least.. thanks :')
Thanks alot for this advice. It's really reassuring.. 🙏"	ppji62	trans	473	0.97	2021-09-16 18:52:20
Explaining yourself against the people with the One Joke.		"I like to respond with: ""Maybe try identifying as an original joke instead.""
ask them how many pebbles you can put into their pockets before they can't swim.
I'm ashamed for all weed smokers that this fucker has 420 at the end of his name. They do not represent us
Yours sincerely,
Rational Stoners
If “I identify as an attack helicopter” is funny enough to you to be worth repeating, your life must be pretty sad. Go watch a decent comedian sometime!
""Daring today aren't we?""
I have no problem sinking down to their level... ""ME TOO, A GIRRRRRLLL ATTACK HELICOPTER!"" *spins shenis aggressively*
“your life must be pretty sad” yeah dude my parents made me pretend i was a girl my whole childhood, you wanna act like that wouldn’t have fucked you up? like damn 😂
I've never met a self aware sentient helicopter until now. How did this helicopter learn our language so well & get a social media account🤔??
I actually tried turning it around on one numpty...

""Really? An Attack Helicopter? That's neat. What are your designations?""

I left the bastard speechless and was able to go about my day feeling a bit better about myself.
""If me saying [bigoted statement] makes your life worse, then your life must be pretty sad.""

Me: ""How do you figure?""

Translation: ""Say something defensive so that I can turn the tables on you.""
UPDATE: I left the sub. The place is turning into a conservative shithole and I miss the days when it was good and tried to be funny
It's more tiring then anything. Like get a new joke! 🙄
Unfortunately these ppl live by the rules of “If you’re explaining, you’re losing, and everything is a battle” while they’re on Reddit. It’s unfortunately just not the platform for winning anyone over
Hey, that's my joke!
the thing is that if he says that he's an attack helicopter, then I'll just say that his 'missile' is a dud. and then he'd be the offended one. and then the roles would be reversed. so tbh, idk why he's tryin to chat shit
The more you try to explain the more people laugh at you. It’s not worth the bother with them
I'd probably say something about the attack helicopter joke making to trans egg cracking pipeline.   
Not sure if that's actually a thing, but I've heard some anecdotes...
Same with autism too, not just for me but others I've talked to and heard from as well: being autistic isn't the problem, the cruel of society are.

Any time someone is different there will be cruelty, and when its accepted by a large enough group of society, their humanity degrades, moral compass becomes lost.
lol, such a hackneyed joke. in fact, I'm calm about such jokes. but yes, i understand this devalues the experience of transgender and non-binary people. idk, i wouldn't be offended if they told me that. i think this is due to the fact that I live in a transphobic environment and im used to hearing this in my address. actually, i used to use such a joke myself once.. i have never reproached it with transgender or non-binary people in order to, idk, hide myself. 
rather, it looks like this. 
Someone: ""hey girl"" 
I: ""actually, im a helicopter."" 
then the one to whom I said this, most often, starts jokingly calling me he (the helicopter in my language has a masculine gender), which suits me quite well(im trans boy in closet). anyway, in the case of like in the screenshot, i think we just shouldn't pay attention to such jokers. our answer will not make transphobes smarter..
I'm trans and I feel bad when I laugh at those jokes
Not trans...I just tell them if they identify as a helicopter they need to see a psychiatrist to help them get back to reality.
Don't waste time addressing them. Just respond with ""An attack helicopter joke in 20XX"" and leave it at that.
I personally identify as a MH-6, but, I *really* have a thing for VTOL jets. Like if I could just plant my slides down on top of mommy Harrier I'd *absolutely melt. mmpphghfzlhdsui*

God she's so hot, total JILF. Anyway, yeah when people made that joke I didn't think it was trans targeted...since that wasn't a concept I knew of, and just, imagined my self as one...and I maybe have some anthro jet R34 pics stashed away now.
That's a spicy meatball
Or ""Get back to me when you identify as someone who's actually funny""
Nice phrase there, I'm stealing it
lol, yea ik. A lot of ppl (kids) just put the haha weed funny number at the end of names when they want to make their username le epic.
I hope I can do a better job, then. Even though I don’t smoke.
I assume this is satire or /j
The legendary shenis spinner 😆
the wonders of ai (albeit still stupid)...
Yeah it can feel like that too definitely.
Well no, I actually went on to have a healthy dialogue with the OP and people stopped responding because they couldn't argue the point anymore.
I mean yea it has been trans targeting a lot on the internet. Ppl don't understand trans and NB people so they make a ridiculous comparison to make those people seem ridiculous and then other ignorant people laugh about it because that's how they see it as well. Never thought I'd see the word JILF lol.
not mine. it's from bhuddism.
I mean that at the screenshot “jokester”, not at you.
Ah ok nice
I'm impressed, my initial thought was that only 1% ask that sort of question in good faith; for the rest it's sealioning and dog whistle.

Nice to hear you found the 1%.
The chain of skullduggery shall continue, then! mwahahahhahaha!
Okay, thank you for clarifying. I suck at identifying who jokes are directed at or if they're serious or not, both irl and online.
Yeah it was a nice turn of events.
Yeah seriously, I had a few arguments but the convo with OP was really good and honestly the arguments were take compared to the stuff I've argued about on Insta."	11c7so7	trans	466	0.98	2023-02-26 06:57:40
One of my best friends likes “What is a woman?” and I’m devastated	Pretty self explanatory. I’m a closeted transfem. Even though this friend of mine is a “liberal right” and disagrees with most of the his political views, I still thought he was a good person. That is until I overheard him talking about how much he liked “What is a woman?” by Matt Walsh and thought it was funny. I lost my respect and admiration for him. I’m just sad, and now more than ever I fear I’ll lose all my friends once I come out 😖	"And just wtf is a ""liberal right""?

EDIT: A lot of the comments below showed how narrow my knowledge of this is. Read on to watch me get schooled.
IMO you didn't lose a friend, you shed a toxic relationship. I'm betting that there would be other areas where you two would disagree sooner or later.
That sucks. There is someone I used to like on a professional forum that I read who tried to argue that ""What is a woman"" isn't hate speech and it pissed me off so much that I had to create a new account so I could come out as trans and chew him out. The good news there is that everyone else took my side.

But that was just an online acquaintance. For it to actually be a good friend would hurt so much more and I'm sorry you had to experience that.

In terms of losing friends, unfortunately some people won't be accepting. But I have also gotten a lot of support from some people that I didn't expect to be supportive, and hopefully you will too.
Tell them the whole movie is one gigantic circular argument because in the end he just ask his wife and she says a biological human female. When he asked someone else that and they responded like that he went off saying it was circular. Plus his hostile agenda driven ""gotcha"" style of journalism never gets to the truth. Matt Walsh is a paper tiger when it comes to sound logical debate about gender and all that's being that tiger is a sad angry little man.
Right wingers cannot be good people. Live by that rule and you'll be a lot safer as a transfem.
Im really sorry op, and it sucks losing friends, but you dodged a massive fucking bullet
Read “liberal right” and went “nope.” There’s no such thing, at least not in the US political spectrum. This person is likely a closet fascist and merely pretends to disagree with Walsh. Get far away from them.
If you would Like the ultimate deconstruction of that shit video and human Matt Walsh, Jessie gender(transwoman video essayist) has a fantastic video on it. [here](https://youtu.be/75bbNdlX2pA)

 I'm sorry your friend has revealed they are garbage. But honestly if that's how they feel I don't think they would make a very good friend.
Spam him with all of the take downs of that piece of garbage. ~~Two~~ A few of my favorites are:  
[Jessie Gender](https://youtu.be/6jJty8Dcmuk), [Jessie’s 4hour piece on it](https://youtu.be/75bbNdlX2pA),  [Lonerbox‘s short spot on take](https://youtu.be/sWSY_Y5fxUA), or [Tom. Nicholas‘ trans debate video](https://youtu.be/oAMM3l156Oo). 

And while we‘re at it, he might find [this one enlightening for „biological reasons xD](https://youtu.be/szf4hzQ5ztg) and [this Gender Theory for Dudes](https://youtu.be/Sp0I-qoQLuA)
anyone who thinks what is a woman is a logical and objective counter argument to the existence of transgender people has soup brain, you don’t want them in your life anyway
Healthy people change when they learn they know someone gay/trans. It can be eye opening to realize you actually know someone who's trans rather than the medias depletion. It's easier to see the answers to the questions surrounding what is a woman. When you know women who don't meet the standard definitions. 

The movie is literally designed to counter the gender movement. It's meant to validate Matt Walsh and daily wire opinion. You're supposed to watch it and come away with the same opinion as them. To some degree your friend just fell victim to that. Until he realizes that the dailywire has shit opinions and inabilites the Republicans to be trash, he probably won't move away from being on the ""liberal right"" side of things. When/if these conversations come up, pull out the dictionary and look up the definition of woman. (Or like the Olympics even have their own definitions and regulations that i have found to be difficult to argue) The doctors the daily wire or Matt Walsh are interviewing usually have very limited experience in that field.
“Liberal right” like libertarian? Because if so yikes
Sometimes you have to just stop talking to people
Yeah, unfortunately out of hundreds of friends and dozens of family members i ended up with my momma and 1 friend...

But you know what?... it was so worth it. My soul is calm, happy and safe and I've made those friends back and so much more. I could never have imagined laying in bed with my very own boyfriend, one whos my biggest fan and I his. The personal liberation is nothing short of cosmic. Like the alignment of planets you finally KNOW you are exactly where you should be. Its special and words really cant describe it properly, it must be lived.

I wish you all the world, friend!
op, i lost almost all my freinds when i came out, i thought my circle and i were thick as theives.

i have much fewer relationships, but much more meaningful relationships now.

people who dont respect basic human rights aren't worth your freindship.
Just show him the clip of Matt Walsh advocating for child brides and child pregnancy show him what a monster matt Walsh is…
I have a friend, best friend through most of college, who I talked to in person for the first time in two years (moved away for a master's program) and he called puberty blockers for trans teens ""chemical castration"". And he thinks, somehow, that he's very progressive and pro human rights. It sucks.
Almost the same thing happened to me ! An ex friend messaged me out of no where, telling me to watch a video. I watched it all, and it was a couple reacting positively to What Is A Woman. That person knows I am transmasc, but still sent me that link because ""they want me to be safe and not do something I'll regret"". They always do that !! I hope you get a better friend 💞💞
I mean, I also like that video. Shows just how stupid Matt Walsh is and anyone else who thinks that a woman is just someone with a vagina.
Something like that sucks ... I'm damn sorry for you. But I can well understand. I'm in a similar situation and honestly you can not do that to yourself all the time. Your fears I can understand too well. I wish you the best in the future anyway.
I believe everyone has the right to think how they want but if those views affect my mental health then it's time yo get away from them. You can find people who wil respect your identity
Maybe talk to him about how it makes you feel
he sounds lost. it really is devastating and sad. But you have quite a few friends, many of whom you haven’t even met yet :)
I'd started finding a new circle of friends before my coming out began. It can hurt to lose friends, especially when there are precious memories associated with them. But you will make new friends with new precious memories.
First off, let's all agree that anything Matt Walsh says is going to be garbage. While I don't condone political violence, I do sometimes hope that a smallish rogue metor finds him driving on an abandoned highway at night.
The thing is that a lot of cis people have this question generally when questioning the logic of being trans. The problem is that WiaW, even when taking out the fact that it's transphobic nonsense, is a HORRIBLE documentary and a horrible way to get an answer to this question.  


The man goes to a professional and skips over what they have to say, just to take the word of some people who live in a remote village and known antitrans activists like Jordan Peterson. It's because he only has one conclusion in mind and will do anything to confirm his biases, but he'll trick anyone into thinking that he's coming at it from an ""objective standpoint"".
Your situation is easily similar to mine, I'm transfem too, though I unable to come out in current situation, which is living with a transphobic helicopter parent, and the ""what is a women"" portion is my grandma, she watches it like it's some new philosophical show, it's hard for me to be around them, but I try to leave without a valid reason I'll be buried under a mountain of questions ""where, why, with who, ect."", that or its just ""No I've got shit for you to do"", my best advice is, since it's a friend, maybe try to educate them, and if that doesn't, or they just don't listen to you, can you truly call them a friend?
I hate Matt Walsh with a burning passion. He came to my campus in October and obviously I protested it. Still, there were people lined up out the door to see “What is a woman” and the “q&a” thing they were doing. My college is arguably one of the most liberal in the country. And still, he came to our campus after being *invited* by students. I hate it here.

Fuck Matt Walsh and anyone who supports him. OP, you dodged a massive bullet.
Tell them about how mat Walsh is a massive pedophile and see if they try defend him or not. If they change their minds then maybe there is hope for them.
That’s really horrible of him to like. Have ya tried confronting him about it?
You don’t have to ditch your friend.

If you are both young then there’s a fair chance he will grow out of it.

You could maybe shift his opinion by casually mentioning positive trans moments.  Just cute things which can be unpolitical. I know when I was transphobic it was just because I never knew of anything positive trans stuff. 


but if that stuff doesn’t work then your mental health comes first and you should just slowly distance away from them if you can and maybe I know 5 years he will hear vaguely on the grapevine that you transitioned and are having a wonderful life
Tell him, maybe him having a close friend whos trans will make him rethink his opinion on trans people
Sorry if I'm not on everyone's side here, but I just don't think that someone's likings are a way to determine if they're a good person or not.
Disagreeing with someone is natural and sometimes even necesary for a good conversation or just to know if you can be good friends, but that doesn't mean neither of you are bad. Have you asked him why he likes the documentary? If he believes in what it says or if it's just funny?

The most important thing here is your safety and if you think he wont accept you as you are maybe he is not good for you, but I don't think you should base an opinion that strong on a conversation you overheard
I do not take my medical advice or scientific lessons from a clown. Because a clown is only good at entertaining you. Making you a ballon animal, honking his big red nose before smashing a cream pie in your face. It is nothing but a cheap thrill and a laugh. There is no substance in it expect that bitter feeling you get from getting smashed in the face with a cream pie. 😰 When someone shows you who they really are the first time, believe them. Sorry for your loss. 💐🐳🌼
if you have the emotional bandwidth and still want to interact with him in a “friendly” way, make fun of him for liking that.  do it in such a way that you are putting matt Walsh’s BS down and marking this guy as gullible for buying into it. that way he’ll probably re-evaluate the media and put it down rather than feeling “persecuted for believing in sex” or some BS like that.

an example would be: “omg i checked out that matt walsh thing you mentioned!” XD “that guy is such a moron, i can’t believe he had so many experts stoop down to explain things to him like he was 5, but he STILL doesn’t actually know what a woman is!” XD “how bigheaded can a person be??” XD. if he clarifies that he agreed with walsh, i’d give him 2 chuckles, an “oh wait you’re serious?” give him an up and down, stifle a chuckle, and say “okayyyyy, have fun with that” and walk away.  

if you want to do that, just adapt it to your speech and body language so it doesn’t seem too out of place.
If they stay away from you because you 'came out' then they're not true friends!
The worst part is like all other conservative youtubers and commentators i can understand where someone might be coming from when they say they like the person because they are memable, bland or at least not a massive asshole but Matt Walsh even when he has ""even broken clock is right"" moments he's just a dick and I dont get how anyone can like him.
Sad. I have lost many friends and stopped talking to family over stuff like this.
In my experience it tends to be a mentally 13 year old libertarian who hates the fact that they have to participate in the society they live in, whether that means paying taxes, the mere existence nondiscrimination laws, or being told ""no.""
I'm assuming it's someone who's socially left but economically right. However they don't understand that the two deeply overlap. Most social reforms can't happen without economic reforms. Can't be pro union and pro capitalism.
I mean liberal ideology is relatively speaking fairly right wing as oposed to something like democratic ideology.
I think it’s just neo-liberalism and neo-conservatism. AKA Reaganism
uh, liberalism is a right-wing belief? correct me if im wrong but im pretty sure thats what it is
There are SO many things I don’t agree, but up to this point I thought he was just naive, not that he actually believed in that…
That sucks, but I’m glad people supported you in the end… and yeah, I guess it’s not everyone who will be happy with me living my life.
I hate that guy! Producing media which only intend is to make trans people’s life harder, whether through violence or misinformation.
I always answer with woman is a “gender identity that is typically associated with the female sex. Women generally have or want to have those traits and/or the presentation associated with the female sex. Gender identity is a biological fact and not a choice. Transgender women generally desire to have the traits of cisgender women and share their experience as women, and often pursue as such. This is not a choice for transgender women and is often a matter between life and death as they are women stuck in the incorrect body and/or social role. As such, transgender women are real women and should be considered as such.”

I also want to include that while a vast majority of trans women pursue or would like to pursue medical transition, not all do, just as many cis women have or desire masculine traits (such as disliking their breasts or wanting to be more muscular) while still identifying as women. Women is a very broad category and there is no one universal female experience. Trans woman have their own unique experience that should be included in the discussions on the female experience.
She says that while making him a sandwich! What a role model to come a give me definitions, f#ck that dude and his wife lol
Most of them want to be but get spoon fed lies.  I have to deal with a lot of right wingers and I spend a lot of time pointing out specific things they mention are misinformation.  I don't argue or take a political stance, just point out the facts when they bring something up.  It's fairly effective at shutting down their incorrect views, however my voice is small compared to the hate spread on many national media stations...
I think you’re right, honestly. I don’t think I’ll want to be his friend once I come out if he keep up with this shit…
I feel like I have to agree with you. Here in Brazil, things are similar. The so called “liberals” act like borderline fascists, trying to sabotage the humanitarian politics in every way the can, claiming “the government is evil and steals from people, so let’s destroy everything and give it to companies who surely will think about the people’s needs”. It f***ing sucks!
I LOVED this video! Not only it deconstructs everything he says, but also shows how much of human garbage Matt Walsh really is! 

And thanks. I think you’re right.
Hell yeah! Might do just that :3
Yeah, I’ll give it a go. I’m kinda tired of passively hearing that “liberal” and “conservative” shit. Thanks 😊
Yeah, I didn’t know how to say it in English. Sorry 😅
might be worth to sit him down and say something like ""we can't be friends because of your transphobia"" first but just disappearing out of their life works too
Thanks, dude. I hope you get a better friend too :3
That’s true, but what raised the biggest red flag for me was him calling that a “documentary”
Thank you 😊 I’ll try to be strong for the days to come 😁
Thank you 😊
Thanks 😊 I’ll keep that in mind, and hopefully I’ll find nice people along the way.
I’ve kinda given up arguing with him by now. I’ve tried before, and the only thing I got was being called “intolerable” and “unable to hear a different point of view”
I will try, of course, but I’m kinda tired of keeping my hopes up for him. We’re in our 30s, and honestly you really have to want to change at this point. 

I just wanna figure myself out financially before coming out (I’ve lived 30 years as a man, and I don’t wanna live the rest of my life as one), then I guess I’ll have to give them a choice of either accepting me or staying out of my life.
Exactly. They think they get to claim being liberal because they are for legalizing drugs and sex work, but draw the line at other issues that don’t affect them like lgbt rights. Usually it just means they aren’t religious but still vote right wing.
So someone who wants to improve society without dismantling the systems that prevent progress. Sounds about *right*
That's just framing a leftist framework against an even more leftist framework. They're both still left of center. Maybe not the neoliberalism of the American Democratic party, but liberalism as a general concept.
More like classical liberalism, lassaiz fair capitalism and tolerance, though not necisarily acceptance, of social issues are corner stones of right wing libertarianism.
The terms left and right wing refer to how liberal or conservative a view is. Left means liberal and right means conservative. So ""liberal right"" is an oxymoron.
Yup 100%. And it'd super clear they don't care about kids as they like to claim. It's a hateful agenda
you're a better person than me, my brother is heavy down the rightie pipeline and I just straight up hit him when he spews BS.
Did he vote for Bolsonaro?
No problem <3. Being Trans is hard, but every one of us that makes a decent life for ourselves slowly, but surely, defeats these people's bull shit.
Like at the end of the day, this really isn't about politics. It's about your friendship. Hopefully he sees that as well and understands your happiness is more important than dailywires opinion of gender
Liberal right is a valid way to say it in english . That would usually imply people who think that John Locke’s theories of property and rights are correct. 

Classical liberal is a slightly bigger group. It includes thinkers like Kant who think that discussing Rights are the proper way to do government.

Both of these have connotations in contemporary politics because self-identified “classical liberals” are just right-wing people who support capitalism.

In American politics, “liberal” is a synonym for “left-wing”. It’s opposed to “conservative” meaning “right-wing”. 

Libertarianism includes both left-wing and right-wing figures that think freedom is the highest value. Noam Chomsky identifies himself as a leftist libertarian.

In American politics, though, the “Libertarian” party is a right-wing party in favor of deregulating markets. They find their basis in Hayek and Nozick among other right-wing philosophers. Technically, the party is in favor of some left-wing policies, such as the legalization of marijuana and abortion. However, in reality, people who call themselves “libertarians” typically just vote for right-wing crypto-fascist politicians because they care about capitalism and deregulated markets more than anything else.
Yeah. When the time comes, and I’m ready to come out, I’ll do just that.
I know, I wasn't justifying him. Your ex friend is way in the wrong.
Awesome 😁
You will. I believe in you!
In that case it'll only get worse from here on out so you should bail. Someone incapable of self-reflection or accepting criticism will simply grow more and more toxic over time.
You need to get out of that friendship.
That’s fair. I was just trying to offer a different view as opposed to no contact. But that doesn’t mean that one is better than the other
They only support sex work as far as ""I can pay for sex."" They don't give a shit about the wellbeing of the workers. They really only care about things that directly effect them.
The right believes in small government and freedom. That's why their definition of ""woman"" excludes many self identifying women.
Liberalism is not really a left wing framework. More so than feudalism and oligarchy perhaps but I don't think anyone is seriously advocating for that.

Whilst socially its more central it is of the three main modern ideologies by far the most right wing economically.

I don't really understand how you can in good faith argue that taking power away from democratic institutions and giving it to the wealthy is a left wing stance.
That's only based on the stupid American definitions. 99% of liberalism is economic liberalism - that is, free markets and so on. I'm the furthest you could be from a liberal (I'm a communist), but I'm left-wing. Liberal right is very much real and refers to Republicans among others, liberal left is basically Democrats. The reason America invented its own political definitions is because the viewpoints presented in the ""multi-party"" system aren't all that different.
Well, modern libertarianism is commonly associated with right-wing politics
Yup, did research (few minutes of reading online and a google search) and yeah, liberalism is definitely a right-wing belief.
These are usually co-workers, people I instruct, or supervise, so I do not have the luxury of throwing blows.  :)  While I'm certain your method is FAR more satisfying, it's probably slightly less constructive as well.
Yep 😒 I’m SO glad Bolsonaro lost the election this year. Another four years would ruin this country even more 😭
I get it. Don’t worry 😁 and thanks.
Agreed. Probably don’t call them sex workers either, but they definitely think supporting things because they wanna do them makes them liberal lol
""Freedom for me, not for thee.""
Which isn't the same thing as liberalism...
Oh then there’s no question. He is a fascist.
Political ideologies evolve over time
Look I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong. They're literally completely different ideologies. Liberals are for government regulation and *liberal* tax spending for social programs. Libertarians are for deregulation and the free market.
oh damn youre right i guess
The statement *“liberals are for government regulation”* is such an American viewpoint. In most of the rest of the world, the word *liberal* has the meaning of liberty *from* government intervention, both in private matters (like drug usage) and in the economy. It’s usually a less extreme viewpoint than libertarianism though"	ziv4dx	trans	460	0.97	2022-12-11 14:54:56
Can’t start HRT because I’m anemic :(	"I wanted to start taking T and transitioning more into a non-binary type of look because I have extreme gender dysphoria. My voice always gives me away and it makes me sad because I don’t feel female / womanly at all so being perceived as one is hard. I’m trans masc and am old enough to start taking T on my own now and to make my own decisions. 

I just got diagnosed with anemia last month and got some blood transfusions along with iron supplements and feel a lot better. It just sucks because my doctor wants me to get my anemia under control in around 3-6 months before I do anything to my body. It makes perfect sense, but I’ve been waiting practically my whole life to transition and having delays is going to be tough. 

Just needed to rant and hopefully gather the strength to survive a few more months without looking or sounding like someone I’m happy with yet 🙃"	"Hang in there.  I had to get my cholesterol under control and lose weight to start HRT, but I got there eventually. 

3 to 6 months may feel like a long time, but it'll be here before you know it.
https://www.practiceupdate.com/content/treatment-with-testosterone-improves-anemia-in-men-with-low-testosterone-levels/

>Conclusions and Relevance. Among older men with low testosterone levels, testosterone treatment significantly increased the hemoglobin levels of those with unexplained anemia as well as those with anemia from known causes.


Tell your doc to do some research, why get your anemia under control first when taking testosterone is a possible treatment for it
My transmasc partner had anemia when they started T and it completely fixed the anemia they'd had for years. What the heck?
Dont worry, the months will pass and before you know it you will start hrt and looking back it will feel like maybe  weeks of waiting. It happened to me too. If everything had gone well I should have gotten on T around February, but only started HRT in July. I feel you, but its really gonna be alright, believe me
im so sorry
Tbh I recommend getting a second opinion. I’m not a doctor so like definitely check with a professional but I know in my case and other folks too where T has actually helped their anemia because it ups your red blood cell production. Like I used to be hella anemic my whole life and sense I’ve started I’ve been way better.
Needing to get some stuff stabilised/under control before starting hrt is very common, 3/6 months rly isn’t the longest I’ve heard of. Just think about how much you probably had to wait already, this is nothing. I know it sucks but hang in there, once it’s under control you’ll be able to start hrt without risking to have to stop for way longer because it caused some issues.
Maybe you could try minoxidil (talk about it with your doctor) and voice exercises while waiting?
I would get a second opinion if you can. I’m 11 months on T. I started borderline anemic and now my doctor is suggesting I donated blood if my blood count gets much higher on my next set of labs…
The delays are awful, I totally understand. I was delayed only by 2 weeks because of my doctor really digging into research around hormone therapies and my weird, rare condition, and it drove me nuts with anxiety.

Big hugs, my brother. 💙🫂 We’ll support you through it! 🏳️‍⚧️
As someone who didn't begin transitioning until their late 30s I understand the feeling of wanting to transition and not being able to, for whatever reason.  Be patient and show yourself grace.  Everything will happen when it is right. And it is so much better in the long run to take your time and transition safely as opposed to rushing and possibly risking your health.
You can do it!! You are strong and you deserve the happiness that awaits, just hang in there beautiful person 💕
You can find another doctor if the waiting list isn’t long. My doctor let me go through with hrt even though I smoked, smoked weed, did psychedelics which lower blood pressure along with HRT which also lowers blood pressure, and I was very vitamin d deficient. She still let me start HRT and pointed out that cis women can begin using the same drugs without being told to quit smoking or get healthy, they only tell trans patients that. Cis women smoke on birth control and doctors never bat an eye, my doctor was well aware of that hypocrisy.
I get you I’ve been trying to get started on E it just keeps getting delayed and I don’t have an appointment with a psychiatrist until September. I feel like it’s taking forever for me too. However, I’m sure it’s worth the wait. Hang in there and we will both be there someday.
I’ve been anemic my entire life and starting even just a low dose of T fixed my anemia within a couple of months, no joke. If you’re in the US and can afford it, I’d recommend looking into a service like Plume if your doctor isn’t budging on this.
That sucks, I'm sorry. It also seems strange because T stimulates Red blood cell production, and reduces menstruation to boot. You'd think it would be actually help anemia.
Hey man! Come here! _Hugs_

I know how it feels to have to wait so long and then get denied. I was crushed. It wasn’t due to my health however it was due to them gate keeping me.

You might enjoy [RadPax](https://youtube.com/c/RadPaxOfficial), he’s in a similar predicament and his videos helped me.
I can confirm testosterone increases Red bloodcell count and hemoglobin.

It will fix your anemia in a couple months.
I agree with others, I recommend getting a second opinion, preferably from an endocrinologist who has experience with HRT and trans folks. 

Otherwise, if you ultimately decide with your health care team that you need to wait, just know it's okay to grieve and be sad about this. Let yourself feel your feelings and consider making a goal to work on in the meantime so you still feel like you are making progress (like voice training since that causes you a lot of dysphoria).
Just know that we are here for you. 

Maybe get a journal, and each day, give yourself one page to rant, and another clean page for your gratitudes and dreams...
I am also anemic and highly recommend Floradix. They have liquid and pill form and I take the pill form because it’s a little cheaper on iherb. Good luck!
Do you drink diet drinks?
wait you cant start hrt if you're anemic? shiiiit bro im also anemic
thank you i’ll definitely try 🤞
Thank you!! I will definitely bring this up
I have to get blood test done every 6 months to make sure I'm not over producing because I'm on T. And a friend of mine has to donate blood every so often to regulate their hgb because they're on T.
So to follow what you're saying: T makes the body produce more blood.
Whattt, this is the first time I’ve heard this. I’ll definitely look into it now or find a different health provider asap because that’s not sitting right with me
AFAB tend to be more likely to have anemia due to our monthly cycle so if that stops while you're on T then that could completely change for someone
I know it did for me, I'm FtM and have been on T for over a year and I'm anemic. I still have some issues but after I stopped losing all that blood every month I stopped waking up with 20 random bruises on my limbs 🥲
thank you!! i’m hoping time will pass as fast for me
You’re 100% right. It just sucked to hear the news but I’ll manage. I’ll def see what I can do in the mean time, thank you!
thank you so much 🤍🤍
thank you 🤍🤍🤍
nah i only drink water, coffee, and tea and nothing else
I’m not sure if it’s the same for everyone, in my case this happened because my anemia was messing with my heart rate making it abnormally low, i was fainting, getting dizzy, was very pale and had the common symptoms for months but only got diagnosed when it was far too late and needed two blood transfusions. I feel a lot better but my family doctor who was with me through the process kind of just made the excuse to not let me start HRT because they think my health is unpredictable atm. This is even after I did another round of labs and everything came back significantly better and I have felt fine since. 

You may be able to start HRT despite being anemic, I think my situation was more personal and a bit targeted between me and my doctor so definitely don’t stress yourself out thinking you won’t be able to get it one day 😅 hope I didn’t worry you
im in the army and has taken months to be seen by anyone, and have to wait months for it to move forward anymore, and have no clue how long this is truly going to take. i dont think ive related to anything recently as hard as “been waiting practically my whole life to transition amd having delays is going to be tough”
Honestly most health providers know sooo little about trans specific health care. Unless your provider is a trans specific practitioner, unfortunately trans people often have to do the job of educating our doctors about trans health. 

By all means find a new provider if that’ll make you most comfortable—id suggest looking for someone practicing in a lgbt health clinic or program. But unfortunately you may find your new provider is similarly unaware of this particular phenomenon. 

In the meantime, you could always try sending your current doctor information about t helping address anemia (maybe you can find something more reputable than a Reddit thread? Lol) and see what they say. Obviously you shouldn’t have to do the work to educate your own providers, but it’s the unfortunate reality of trans health care.
Yeah their initial blood panel- anemic
1st panel on HRT- no longer anemic and never went back
I was anemic before T, my levels are absolutely perfect now 8 months on T
No yeah I've been anemic my entire life on and off and my doc said T would likely fix that. My iron levels were low when I started and given that all my symptoms have basically stopped, I'd imagine my first blood test will be normal. They tell you if you don't have anemia *to* donate blood, so it makes sense that if you have anemia T will help. Obviously I'm not a doctor or anything, I've just been around a lot lmao.
Soon you will too mate!
👌
oh no worries! you didn't worry me at all, just a little shocked 🙇🏾 i hope you manage to start hrt soon!!"	wxlcm1	trans	457	0.99	2022-08-25 18:15:59
Seeing so much trans discourse lately and it makes me super sad, there’s more but I ran out of room which tells you a lot 🙃		"Agreed, transphobes fucking suck. Hoping you find some wonderful trans community. Fuck anyone in the pink blob category. They'll learn eventually and regret it all.
All the transphobes need to shut up we're all just hunks of mass atleast let people be happy hunks of mass
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but TERFS are trans-exclusionary radical feminists, right?
Yeah this sucks so much I just got told by my male parent( I don't call him dad for...reasons) that he won't consider me to be a female or use my pronouns until I get gender confirming surgery...that's at least two years from now...
What does terf stand for? I've heard it around a lot, but I've never heard what it stands for
This post is giving for me. We all know the old adage: “it be your own people sometimes”.
The pain I feel from this is massive.
LOL.
I personally can let it go but it just makes me so sad for trans youth and trans people who are just coming out/trying to figure out who they are. It’s already scary and your already vulnerable it’s just sad
Facts... Although I don't consider myself as a trans, but seeing all this hate pisses me off. Like, can't they just accept them whoever they are?! Damn this mentality is so toxic coming from these transophobic punks
trans-exclusionary radical feminist :) they are transphobes who target trans women mostly.
Yea definitely. I was led astray when i was like 20 or so. People convinced me all men are garbage and i shouldnt want to associate with them and convinced me i was a butch lesbian, the term that gave me the most dysphoria, but they told me the dysphoria was internalized misogyny and lesbophobia. Never should have listened to them (they never should have been saying that stuff), am now a very happy and proud gay/queer/into all genders trans abomination who definitely has a little bit of manhood in my complex gender situation 😂 also GOD i love men lol and those people were so wrong about all of it and i just feel bad for them now and i hope they figured their shit out, and i hope anyone still affected by that kind of stuff finds their way into accepting spaces
Tysm :)
Well as a representative of the male subsect, we welcome you and all other Masc people with open arms *Just avoid room 8* those are the ones who don't think trans men, or transmasc etc. are real men so we just shoved them in a room and locked it, a few get out here and there but you have my full backing
Aw yay thank you!!! Hope you all accept men who wear makeup and crop tops and booty shorts because that's me too, sometimes people have thought it weird I don't want to just wear all clothes from the men's section but it is too hot out and I have too many fashion ideas for that 😅😅😅
I'm straight as a no.2 pencil and have willingly worn makeup so I hope so lol, but personally I feel men come in all shades, shapes, sizes, and orientations"	wdpzup	trans	413	0.99	2022-08-01 19:23:39
My mom wont accept me :(	"Before i really knew what was going on with my identity I came out to my mom (about 2 years ago) and admitted I wanted to be more a guy… kinda. (For reference Im AFAB nonbinary but I use male names and pronouns.) I explained that I pretty much wanted to be a guy save for the gentitals and maybe no HRT. 

She didn’t understand and was upset- not mad, but really sad. She said she was worried about me and any time Ive brought up my gender since then she talks about how i could just be a butch lesbian, or i’m confused by my trans friends, or it could just be a phase, yadda yadda yadda. 

Despite her being the only ally in the house, (my dad and sister are both Extreme republicans, as is most of my family) I feel less and less safe being myself around her. Just yesterday when I said i wanted an androgynous haircut she said she “didnt like when i talked like that.” 

I dont know what to do. I have a binder now, and I havent told her. My therapist has been really helpful, but it sucks knowing that when i really ramp up my transition in college she’s probably gonna hate it."	"yeesh. that sucks hard. it sucks that people like that exist at all. im here for you, dude
In college?! Jeez, you're a grown person!
and ""just be a butch lesbian"" is absolutely hillarious in a really sad way.
i’m sorry :( i hope she comes around
I’m sorry. You deserve better.

You deserve a family that sees, loves and accepts *you*, not their conception of who they wish you were.

You deserve a family that celebrates you finding yourself, and living in accordance with who you are.

They should be proud of the non-binary son (you said you use male names/pronouns so I hope this word is correct - if not, please let me know and I’ll edit it!) they have, rather than a “daughter” who never actually existed.

The fact their hate means they wont see the real you is a profound loss for them, and very sad for you.

My wife and I offer mom-hugs.
My mom was exactly the same when i started my transition including the whole “why can’t you just be a lesbian?” question but over time it really does get better. Sometimes your parents need more time because they’re also transitioning to knowing your authentic self. it can be hard for parents at times because they aren’t as educated so all you can do is be yourself and talk to your mom and therapist together. It will take time but trust me it will be worth it. Really just give it time and be understanding of her side. I know you’re also struggling but it can be a big change for parents who knew you as someone else before your transition. Her being kinda off put about the haircut could be her way of keeping you safe because of your conservative family. I had the same issue with my mom where she worried about my safety around my dad.
You do you. Live for you. Your mom can ride this ride how she wants and if it’s too damaging…the rank of family is earned. It’s not by blood. Relation is all that is. Who is family? I’m growing mine by having people who see me for me and nothing else. It’s a small family but it’s growing.

I had to cut my mom and dad out for several years.. My dad is the big jerk in my situation and my mom is finally on my side but she still doesn’t fully understand. I doubt she ever will.

My dad at least talks to me now but it’s superficial. Kind of like our entire relationship growing up to this point. 

He’s an ass and I think everyone will be heart broken when he’s gone but I won’t. Am I cold? Maybe. Maybe I hold a resentment towards being called an abomination.

You can gradually just prove to your mom that you know who you are by living how you need to live and then thrive.
Live for you find a way to not go home for summers and holidays.
My boyfriend is in a similar boat but it’s his Aunt who was supportive, it’s just an especially unfortunate time for trans people in conservative families with Fox and News Max ginning up more hate
I'm sorry you have to go through this. I'm the parent of a trans teenager. I love my child no matter what. That's what love is. I hope things get better for you soon. Sending love.
Well once she is old and reliant on you. you can just not be there she didn’t support you so you don’t support her
Same
Tell er your nonbinary
thank you qwq
yep :’) im gonna be a senior in school this year and my mom is STILL super overbearing on me
thank you, i hope she can see its hurting me
(son is correct, yes :) ) and thank you, youre both very kind and this means a lot qwq
So in her eyes you’re old enough to choose what you are going to do for the rest of your life but not how you are going to do it.

It kinda sounds like she is actually concerned for the loss of the future she had planned for you rather than you. And the haircut statement is screaming fear of the perception and judgment of others. These are all her problems not yours.
Thats pretty much how she is :/ i think its called “cis grieving” or whatever but she is constantly obsessed with protecting me by making me as closeted as possible- no clothes, hair, whatever that might make someone know im queer. it sucks :/"	wtg5uq	trans	408	0.98	2022-08-20 20:05:33
Is this gender dysphoria	So im pretty much sure im trans (mtf) and whenever i look at pretty girls i always get sad and wish I could wear what they are wearing and just look like them…it really hurts	"yeah, that's dysphoria. have you talked to anyone about it yet? I would suggest doing so if it's safe
that is gender dysphoria and you are trans. you are fully trans.
Yeah :/ does the same thing when I hear my friends talk about girls things. Like it’s dumb but even when they talk about periods, I feel like I wish I could relate even if I know it’s a terrible pain
Same here…. I think this is dysphoria
Sounds like it to me. What you can try doing, is make an account (or use this one if you don’t have any irl friends or family following you) and change your name and pronouns. I did that when I was first not sure myself, and I found I really loved being called a man, and that’s how I knew for sure. 

Plus it’s a safe way to test out names too!
Yeah i would think that's dysphoria... but I haven't even transitioned.
i got that for years before i truly accepted that i was trans. ive had 2 stop watching whole tv shows because ive gotten jealous of the women in them lol. i wish u best of luck figuring urself out!!! :]
I’m sorry about that I’m in a similar situation. I hope things work out and you can wear what you want. Much love <3
Yes, absolutely.   I wish you well
Yes it sounds like gender envy which is a form of gender dysphoria
Feels pretty clear to me, though I'd recommend counciling with a gender therapist if possible.  And we've got your back, sis!
So… to go against the grain here a little bit— it could be gender dysphoria or it could just be envy. And it’s important to understand yourself and the distinction between the two. I know we all wish we could have easy, quick answers and labels to everything but we’re much more complicated than that… don’t assume you’re trans until you take the time to understand these feeling and where they might be coming from. If you truly feel like something isn’t right about yourself and how you identify both in public and privately, then perhaps you might be trans. But I really urge you to delve deep into it because it’s the only way to truly know. Simply asking on Reddit what two vague qualifiers might mean about you won’t give you the correct answer. I suggest seeing a gender therapist and also expressing yourself the way you wish you could as often as possible to get a better idea. Don’t lean on online quizzes or ask a bunch of strangers to figure out you who you are. It may take time but believe me it’s so important to really know because it will change your future one way or another. Best of luck <3
Yeah thats me too. I'm sorry. It's horrible.
Sounds like dysphoria to me.  I felt the same way.
Same and yeah thats basically the definition of gender Dysphoria
Wishing you much love and support on your journey!
Yep sure is.
Yeah I’m pretty sure that dysphoria and that’s basically how I am too.

Idk how active you are on here but r/mtf is a place I use to vent. I use it specifically because sometimes I feel like I need someone with lived experience to help out rather than my girlfriend and friends who are as new to this as I am.

Idk if you’re in college but many universities offer counseling centers with help for LGBTQ+ people among other things some are even open to the community or free of charge. Talking to someone really helps and talking to multiple people helps even more because of multiple perspectives and what not
Ik how you feel *hug* and hopefully it will get better
Textbook
Definitely sounds like dysphoria
Gender envy. My stupid ass disguised it as the horny for years lmfao. Very much dysphoria. Have a hug, sister.
Everyone is shouting that this is dysphoria but clothes do nothing to define gender and I feel people tend to forget that. You can want to and even wear the clothes that women/girls wear without having to transition. Gender dysphoria doesn't begin and end with outfits and I wouldn't want you to get in the mindset that you have to change your entire gender identity just for clothes. Wanting to be female and wanting to look female are separate things, it's a tricky thing to define for a lot of people.
That's dysphoria, alright. I'm sorry you're experiencing those feels, they're never fun to deal with. But things do get a little easier as time goes on. If it's possible in your current situation, maybe try reaching out to a professional who can help you properly?
I'm in no way an expert, but I thought dysphoria was when you actively felt uncomfortable in your body, and not the wish to have the body like someone else.

But again, not an expert. I might be completely wrong.
yes
So it might not be News seeing all the comments here already but the truth is that it could be dysphoria. In general it certainly is a sign for it however there normally is a bit more to it. Do you only feel like you would like to wear female clothes or is there more to it? That was something my therapist asked me as well in our first session. Most of the times gender dysphoria is not only liking cloths that society would deem unfitting for a boy but often it is going a lot deeper. Like your own body or mannerisms. A lot of the time if you feel like you have to put on a mask or put up a show for others that‘s a quite strong sign for dysphoria.

In any case I would recommend to look for someone to talk to like parents, friends, or (as I did it) a local lgbtq+ support group or a professional (but I guess that depends on where you live and if you have an insurance that pays for it)
Cant, transphobic parents, and people around me just arent cool with anything lgbtq+…
I see…well this sucks (the dysphoria sucks, not being trans)
I sadly have no girl friends, would love to though
I guarantee you that plenty of trans men would gift their period/uterus to you in a heartbeat. Why can’t science make this a thing?
Ive been going by she/her pronouns and a different name online for a while now, and yeah, i love it
Neither have i, im pre literally everything
Aw man that sucks, glad you accept it now though, and, thank you!
I see…well ty
Alright. Yeah don’t think its gonna be possible rn, and, ty
Yeah, that makes sense. I have been going by a different name and she/ her pronouns online for a bit now, and when my parents call me he and by my birth name it just dosent feel right. And, ty for the help
Damn
Thanks!
Ahhhh why world
Aight I’ll check it out. And i hope it gets better for you! No groups that I know of as of now though
*hug* <3
Huh?
Damn
Im so sorry for the extremely fucking late reply, but yeah it is indeed. \<3
Yeah, that’s understandable
Alright, and its good to know they get easier to deal with. Sadly not able to reach out to anyone
Fair, from what i know theres many different types of dysphoria
Theres more too it. I look at myself in the mirror and wish i had boobs and stuff like that. And yeah ive talked about it with friends (online)
oh, I'm sorry. sending you some *hugs*
I have the same situation.
You’re not alone
Been there. Is there a way you could convince them to let you try therapy for “depression”? With some sly finagling, you might be able to suggest a therapist that supports LGBTQ+ stuff.
You could try talking to a therapist. It won't solve the issue of most likely being trans with transphobic parents, but it could help you deal with it without the risk of it spiralling into dspression.
actually, I kind of feel like being trans sucks. Does somebody else feel the same? I just wish I didn't have to go through all dysphoria... I wish I were born a girl so that my life didn't have to be spent on trying to be one..

Ofc sometimes I kinda like it, like the euphoria and stuff, but honestly, being trans can be tiring as hell.
Yeah. My boyfriend keeps saying it ahah. Periods suck ass
High fives for knowing you're trans but not doing anything yet!
no problamo!! :P!!
Your welcome
I am still not transitioning (yet) and I always get bummed when I see pretty girl’s especially my friends
They mean you have textbook gender dysphoria.
No thanks for the stimuli
And before this gets a comment saying otherwise, what I'm saying isn't trying to invalidate people who are/have transitioned because they want to wear clothes stereotypically associated with another gender, it's a valid reason to transition but you don't have to transition to wear those clothes.
I'm sorry to hear. But hey, it may not be a professional setting, but you did reach out to us. You have friends here 😊
<3 :)
can i has some too :3
Thats sucks, help it gets better for you
Good to know <3
I dont know…feels like itd be risky, because if they find out what im really doing, i dont think i’l have a place to live anymore
Nah I feel this, even just being born a cis male would have been better
Yeah, i feel that.
Thanks! If i could do anything about it though i would
<3
<3
Oh
Lol what
Yay <3
<3
sure, *hugs*
You too! Thanks so much.
1. What country are you located in?
2. Are you more afraid of the gambit itself or while you’re seeing the therapist?
Oh I forgot the comma. It's supposed to be like ""No, Thank *you* for the stimuli""
1. United Kingdom
2. The gambit itself
Oof. UK. Lovely./s

Maybe not depression, because that implies an inability to self-start and could be sus when you come to them with info. Anxiety might be a better fit as a veil.

There are two solutions to your dilemma:

First: even though he was emotionally abusive, I still learned a lot from my dad. One thing was, “don’t give away the recipe.” Sometimes, you don’t need to give everything away, specify every detail for people to accept your version of events. If your parents honestly seem to care, or like to pretend they care, besides being homophobic, you can go to them and say, “hey, there’s this thing I’ve been dealing with that I don’t feel comfortable talking to you guys about yet, but I need to talk to someone. If I found a therapist, would you help me get an appointment with them?” Keep that line in the sand if they dig, don’t let them cross it. If they’re passing the bare minimum of parenting, they probably won’t try, or will give up after the second time. 

Second: Rarely does transphobia come packaged alone; I’m guessing based on your reactions that your parents are also emotionally manipulative in some manner.

What I’d recommend then, is playing your parents’ game. Make them think you need therapy before you bring it up. While you’re looking up therapists (on private/incognito browsing, be careful), start “ramping up” symptoms. This might be kinda easy, letting down your mask in certain situations. Then, when you think you’ve milked it enough and their concern is at a tipping point, pick a person that also might be concerned with your well-being, someone that loves you. Talk to them beforehand just in case your parents call thanking them or some crap like that; don’t tell them everything, just give them the low-down: “I’ve been having struggles with things that I can’t talk to my parents about yet, can I use you as an out?” And then claim that you talked to them about your struggles and got the info about the therapist from them when you talk to your parents.

Alternatively, you could do a mixture of both, or something inspired by them yet having nothing to do with it. 

Good luck in whatever you end up doing! I’m all ears if you need them during this process, kid. Stay strong.
Alright, and thank you! Man everyone on this sub is so sweet <3
We’ve been where you are.

No one can tell you you are or are not trans. Only you can do that. What someone *can* say is that your experience mirrors theirs or that of those they know. Your experience, excepting your placement on TERF island, mirrors mine. I wish you well on your journey.

A Message to All Trans People in The U.S	"I'm afraid for my and all other trans people's safety  This world is against us

The U.S. keeps getting worse and worse I have seen no improvement.

My state of Illinois is safe and has been,

 but everywhere else seems completely screwed.  Texas is bordering on genocidal actions and Florida's banning of care for trans youth. Arkansas proposed a bill banning GAC for anyone under 26 The spike in anti-trans violence and rhetoric. So much more  Land of the free. That's a straight-up lie.  We preach civil liberty whilst oppressing large groups 

We've seen book burnings, dehumanizing rhetoric, and legislation targeting minorities before.  The 1930's in Germany specifically. Then Minority's warning of what was to come was seen as paranoia and the ramblings of the mad.  

Now trans individuals are treated much the same. Like loons and freaks. They wouldn't listen before, and they won't listen now. Sadly we must fight. Fight for our lives, lest we lose them at the hands of our oppressors.  We must fight any way we know how, but be careful. Your actions now could be used to further demonize us. Tread carefully.  Vandalise and deface the property of bigots.   Leave a message  Make it strong

Make it noticeable  


I felt I needed to say it"	"Oklahoma has a bill to ban trans care for anyone under 26. I think Arkansas' bill was for under 18. So the situation is actually slightly worse which sucks
Peacefully trying to fix things doesnt work, peaceful protests and trying to ""talk"" to nazis don't work, nazis should be afraid of being nazis

You don't progress with peacefully talking with a nazi over tea, they don't deserve respect from anyone, much less from the people they are trying to kill

(This is not directed at OP, I agree with OP's sentiment)
Dear US-based transphobes who I know are lurking here: Thank you for paying your taxes so Veterans like myself can have access to gender affirming care through the VA
I would like to add to OP's stance but add Colorado to the safe zone... we are guaranteed to control the state government for at least another decade. It's a safe haven for LGBTQ+ people. 🏳️‍🌈💯💜🏳️‍⚧️🌈👍❄️🏂🌄🤟⛰️
Basically everything I wanted to say has been said. Even as a cis person I feel scared and want to leave the country before it becomes fascist. Please arm yourselves.
We have to organize.  If we try to deal with this as individuals, we will fail, and the consequences are life and death.  I have already started implementing my exit plan from the U.S. as a contingency plan.  

I'm in a fairly friendly state, and I am planning a sizeable add on to my house in case I need to even temporarily house refugees.
It's insane that I have been telling people this will happen over and over and over and my mom after I actually shared several links over whats going on to let people know lately actually has the audacity to ask me whats wrong. The cis do not care. They just don't. It's not being talked about, it's barely being covered by them so we just do not matter and frankly it terrifies me that even if we did fight back they'd just tell us to get on the cattle cars because it's scaring them to think they would ever have to fight or be uncomfortable.

Just look how they acted when people tried to defend the drag queen bars and you would see comments saying how people with guns are just making it worse and that we would be jeopardizing everyone. We do not matter in their eyes and are only an afterthought.

The irish had the troubles, we have the concerns. Because that's all we are, a concern, a background thought. I try to be optimistic but I can't be right now.
we need to start arming ourselves and protecting ourselves a gay bar was attacked and a gay restaurant had a brick thrown at the window. this isn't new to our people but we need to start self protecting our community. the govt doesn't want to protect us the govt gang(cops) doesn't wanna protect us. it's up to us to protect each other now and im afraid as a trans woman it'll get worse
People are attempting more desperate measures against us because we’ve been making progress, and these sorts of bill (which keep getting proposed, then failing) can help open people’s eyes to the fact that those who are against us are actively trying to kill is and get them to help us. There’s one major step you can take to help: **Tell allocishets in your life about this shit, most of them don’t know, and when they do, they usually get more vocal about supporting us. They won’t fight for us, but once they realize our lives are on the ballot, most will vote for us.** Progress is being made, things are getting better. It’s just a very painful process.
In Arkansas you can drink, drive, vote, etc and do whatever the hell you want but now you’re not mature enough for GAC
America is dead to me. Honestly I don't think anything can save it. 

The worst part is the fact that the toxicity from America is spreading across the border. We've had mass shootings when shit like that never happened here. We're supposed to be better than America not sink to their level. 

At least we haven't back peddled on human rights like you all have. Yet.
I think someone said, that there aren't enough trans people to go full blown Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Movement. One would need to unite every Person under the LGBT+ Label in the U.S. And then I'm not sure if it would be enough.

Of course one could start a counter campaign. Propaganda Posters, Fake News, Fear-Mongering. Kinda using the same stuff they use to unite our people against them. But neither are we that well funded, nor do I think it would work honestly..

But the age of talk and winnning them over through discorse has ended..  it is a war, it is funded, it has a purpose and a goal..

And I don't know what can be done to counter it. Propaply getting armed? Capitalism wins again. Arm both sides and collect per bullet.

I think this will either blow over like every fear campaign has before or it will go ballistic.

In which case: man the barricades, keep the degenerates away from the trans children. We see who kills who, fascist!

I hope this wont happen.. fucking 21 century.
I'm finna grab a couple aks a couple 12 gauges, a couple 9mms and probably a.couple rugs to protect my trans sister
My wife is in prison in Florida and I'm in Oregon. We're petitioning to have her sentence transferred here because she's not safe from the guards there
Thank you! Yes, everyone is needed for unifying against this horrible political trend! It
Keeps spreading to other states and is getting more and more extreme!
With the US burning like this, is Canada truly as good as it sounds? Is that the new safe-haven for all living in the US to move to?
Eventually it'll get to a point where they'll create so many laws, that it'll box in cis people who need access to gender care for other reasons or who don't strictly conform to gender norms.
I wish I could leave but the U.S makes it nearly impossible if you aren't rich which is another issue entirely. I hate this country. ""Land of the free"" my ass.
Good luck and stay safe out there
For anyone looking to flee their state, Trans Activist and mom Erin Reed created a map that shows the best and worst states for trans people. 

[https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/the-final-anti-trans-legislative](https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/the-final-anti-trans-legislative)

If you’re looking to flee the US entirely, the easiest place to go would be Canada, due to the proximity of the country and also has some great protections for trans people, but there are still issues there. Do your research for where you wanna go!

Personally I live in Alabama and I plan on leaving as soon as I finish my degree.
Massachusetts is still a safe haven as is much of VT.
Personally I love trans women/men. Everyone no matter who they identify as or who they like to sleep with is a human,and deserve the same rights as anyone else. No further discussion should be needed!!!
I had to flee Arkansas last year. I was in a small, very insular town, and the amount of transphobic stuff people would spout on the daily was insane. I was in the closet, for obvious reasons, but I had to go because they were starting to sound serious in their threats of ""damnation"".
""It's a big club, and you ain't in it!""

--George Carlin
I think the problem with that strategy is it adds fuel to the fire. Nobody is going to get their shit wrecked and think ""maybe I was wrong about those people"". They'll double down, it'll end up on Fox News, etc.
I'm thankful Maryland is alright for now, though it sucks that my (thankfully cis) girlfriend lives in Texas
What’s important is that we rely on each other, and be lighter than a feather
While I agree that the US government needs to pull its head in, vandalisation and defacing of property will push those neutral to the other side of the arguement. And given that this community is tiny compared to the population, a civil war is also not the answer, especially given the power of the US armed forces. 

Any attempt at physical action like civil war will only cause those who are agressive towards this minority to believe without a doubt that they are in the right and help them convince others.

You need allies that can support you in the court of public opinion and the abilty to change an economy(thus you need large amounts of people and those who are better off economically). In other words, you need both powerful and large amounts of people to support you so the government has to listen. (Think about how segregation and racism was almost entirely eliminated, minus certain parts of the populace.)

TLDR; you will not win a civil war, think logically and politically, get as many people of all across the spectrum to side with you enough to cause a social, political and economic movement in the culture of the United States.
“Dr. King's policy was that nonviolence would achieve the gains for black people in the United States. His major assumption was that if you are nonviolent, if you suffer, your opponent will see your suffering and will be moved to change his heart. That's very good. He only made one fallacious assumption: *In order for nonviolence to work, your opponent must have a conscience. The United States has none.*”

~ Stokely Carmichael
IIRC, North Dakota is trying to pass a compelled speech law that forces all government-funded institutions to use the pronouns ""associated with one's sex as determined by DNA testing.""
Not American, but for some reason it seems like the west coast and north-east coast are the safest places there

Goodnight   
To all see you all whenever I guess
Spreading this shit around. I want as many of us as possible to read my rant. It needs to be done
Remember that this is happening in many regions of the US  (not only in the South, as many still believe).

They want us dead
I'm in the same state, Chicago is the only widely democratic (aka trans friendly-ish) part of Illinois, the rest is redneck ass transphobic mf's. I honestly hate living in lower Illinois. [Edit: there's also hardly trans help groups in the rural areas. I feel completely lost, I hate this state, country, and sometimes the whole damn world.]
I agree that govt things r bad and things seem to be getting worse, but idk homie, “Texas is bordering on genocidal actions” seems like exaggeration to me. I’d love to see evidence to the contrary if u have it. I’m not saying things r good for us there, but I do think it’s important not to make things sound worse than they r, u know? Like Texas isn’t setting up trans person death camps or anything, they’re just fucking hella w laws that will cause death and misery, but not on a mass scale equivalent to genocide. Also, I’ve found that ppl matter a lot more than politics. Politicians can do a lot of harm, but the ppl who live around us r the ones that really affect us imo. It’s chill if I get downvoted for this, I’m just giving my thoughts as a trans girl.
I live in AR. I NEED to transition one if the reasons I quit trying to commit suicide is so I could transition. If I can't do that what reason I have to live?
I'm pretty sure Colorado is another state that is safe. I know they have protection laws for trans people.
Now is the time to get to a safe blue state. Colorado and Illinois are great options if you can't get to the coasts. At the very least, have a plan if these laws are passed. It's super expensive to move, especially across the country, but the net safety gain is well worth it.
I should probably stay up to date on the topic, but does anyone know how bad it is in Pennsylvania?
My heart breaks for my trans siblings in the us every time a new bill is announced. I'm privileged to live in a country where my rights are not attacked and I wish I could do more to help y'all.
Lots of love from your west-European sibling and stay safe
Not in the U.S., but transphobia here is pretty high as well. Being peaceful doesn't help with transphobia itself at all. It only amplifies all the narration against us, which is broadcasted by priests, gov-owned media and right-wing politicians regardless of the party. The only thing why transgenders aren't the main target is that this government is more ""concerned"" about harassing females at all, no matter whether cisgender or transgender. 

However, peaceful informing still helps with trans-friendly initiatives and spreads a word about them.
It's sadly even worse, [Oklahoma has another bill on the docket that is a de facto ban on gender affirming care. For all ages. ](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB250/2023) 

Most if not all of them will get struck down but it's scary as fuck. Seeing your own humanity debated is not a great feeling.
Damn Thanks mixed them up
Church $ at work ! Its how they network.
I can't help but be reminded of Charlie Chaplin's speech from ""The Good Dictator"". I feel like its more relevant now than ever. I wish I had a way to broadcast it to a lot of people, I would have hope that it could change some minds
Armed self defense now
Martin Luther King Jr. was both peaceful and effective.  Not being peaceful could make things way worse for us.  Our generation may not see change.  But, let's represent peace for future generations, at least.
Me too! I truly appreciate old me’s service now lol
This is what taxes should be for.
Same here, thx yall
You’re not helping.  Transphobes are morons.  Don’t do their mental labor for them.
I agree with this! While I don’t live in CO rn, I have family there and grew up there! A lot of my family since I came out has come to me and said “if you ever need to, you know you can come to us and we’ll help you.” So even if shit hits the fan in my current state, I know I’ll have somewhere safe to go. Honestly I friggin love Colorado.
Most of New Mexico is safe too.
New York is good...legally speaking. Stay out of the rural areas of course, cities are mostly fine.
Yes .Colorado is the best. I can always move back in with family in California if it gets bad here which I don’t foresee
As long has Big Gretch is office, Michigan is relatively safe as well! Especially in the Metro Detroit/Ann Arbor areas
I’ve always wanted to move there, even before I knew it’s a safe haven. Hopefully I can move there someday
Oh dang as someone in the middle of arkansas I feel terrified to imagine myself as a fucking refugee having to leave my home despite its flaws.
We have to make some noise and disrupt. You can try to ignore the elephant in the room by looking away, but not when it shrieks in your face

Or as Miles Bron, fiction’s professional idiot, would put it, we have to go past what people are comfortable with and double down
But the LGBT community is too scared of guns or any method of self defense to actually fight, so we will likely all get jailed and tortured eventually because nobody in this community is going to actually take decisive action.
You’re completely right about this! I don’t live in the US thank god, but I managed to get my dad to see how bad things were getting even in our own country just by mentioning a few examples. It’s easy to feel like the world is against us, but most people’s hearts are in the right place, they just need some help moving their brains to that place as well. Gathering allies is vital, and it’s not quite as insurmountable a task as it might seem, provided you don’t waste time on the wrong people of course
Oklahoma I messed up but they proposed a bill that would in short ban GAC for under those 26   


The scary part is I can see how it might get voted into law.
If you're talking about Canada, y'all are just as bad as us, y'all just lie to yourselves about it. You do remember any the whole ""Indigenous Women"" situation, right? And y'all are just as transphobic and homophobic too.
I love the counter campaign idea.
Look up North Dakota’s proposed SB2199. So extreme, scary and oppressive!
theres many ways to fight, you dont have to go out and literally assault someone. Nazis need to be afraid to publicly hold their ideology. period. These are people who literally don’t want us to exist.
Then we need to make any violence against us as too much for the majority of Americans. We need to stop letting them argue our existence and instead force them to explicitly come out against us.
They backed off of black people because they’re afraid.  They don’t know any language but fear.  They prove it every single day.  In their mind, if you don’t scare them then you’re fair game to target.  They only understand predators and prey; nothing else.

The first pride was a line of people throwing bricks.
X and Newton did more for civil rights than King. The suffragettes were violent too.

Nothing ever changes by peaceful protests.
Yup. Like I feel the energy but it’s just not gonna help
How can this be done you ask? Use what we have available to us, social media, a mix of kindness and maybe a bit of painting those who wish harm against  monorities as monsters(without them knowing of course). Cator to the neutral, do not be extreme, don't give those who wish harm ammunition to use against you.

There is so much more that can be done, only ever increasing with every addition to both sides.
More Kwame Ture (aka Stokely Carmichael) here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwEsjhxaG0Y
I hate it here
In general, yeah those are more progressive areas. The west coast has a loooot of rural and conservative area that is often overlooked however.

It's getting Natzi Like
What's the speech?
I also want peace, that doesn't mean we shouldn't fight and protest

Continue on the ""just talking"" will get more and more people killed, nowhere in history people were able to revolutionize history by just having friendly talks with the people that were killing them
Also

Protesting and standing up for our rights ≠ being violent 

It just means that we need to fight for our rights, and if we are attacked by the people that want to opressor us that we need to fight against them, not quietly, not sitting down and talking, but in the streets, making noise, having our voices heard

You cited MLK, but MLK also said that he wasn't against protests and peaceful protesting was not about keeping our heads down and quietly speaking, it was about fighting for rights, screaming and walking in the streets, witouth resorting to violence 


We still need our voices heard, trying to pretend that we can talk with those people won't really help and will just make the future generation have to deal with more problems we left for them, just like the last generatio left us problems


And vandalizing the property of bigots and etc ≠ violence so
Wish people would stop repeating silliness about MLK such as this.

Keeping your head down has a time and place when someone is actively trying to harm you is not it.
This is a pretty whitewashed stance. The only reason King was able to be effective with peace was because his contemporaries were willing to use force. He was seen as the ""sensible moderate"", but even he admitted that his protests would have fallen on deaf ears had it not been for the more militant tactics of Malcom X or the Black Panthers, among others. King didn't succeed despite them, he succeeded BECAUSE of them.
Yeah, then he was shot and riots broke out forcing congress's hand to put out a civil rights act that's still allowed systemic racism to mount to this vary day.

MLK Jr. is a figure head and a focal point. Had he not been the reasonable offering versus the looming threat of widespread civil unrest, he wouldn't have been capitulated to.
Always means the world to be so accepted and loved within the community. <3 thanks friend!
We're at the point where it is not fear mongering.
I'm in Arkansas as well In the northwest part and this is all getting a little scary. I knew sanders was going to do this though. May be time to look at moving elsewhere
it might be for the best, esp for our trans brothers and sisters
I get you, I had to flee Arkansas myself last year. I know it's scary to leave but, at this point, it's getting dangerous to stay. At least set up an escape route. I'll remind you that the ""gay panic"" defense is still legal in Arkansas.
I finally managed to escape Arkansas last summer. Now living in SF and have already made it clear to several of my trans friends from back home that I would help them settle in out here.
ur right our apathy and weakness is why we are so easily pushed around
Unfortunately friend, if you don't live in the USA, you don't know how little this applies. People in the USA don't give a fuck about each other. Human life is cheap here and problems are almost always solved with bullets. And cis people do not give a single, solitary fuck. They hate us. They are not only ok with us being murdered, many of them actively want it. Even so called allies are tepid little bitches that won't do shit to help us. Most won't even show up at a protest, even with no danger to themselves. They've got their own selfish concerns. They don't care. We are entirely on our own.
We have an alt right but they're not the majority. Your country are just a bunch of arseholes who are proud of smelling like the shit they are.
Sure, but we would need artists for anti-right posters and the like. We could also use animators for education videos on the rising threat of naziism in the U S. Doesn't matter if it is exaggerated or not. Thats how this shit works. We would also need people who can write articels. Like when the right does something to the community, we fake news the shit out of it, just like they do with us. And then, if we want to get really dirty here, get some hackers and put smut on Ben Shepiro and Matt Walsh etc. Doxx them, hack them, get them out of the picture. One could try to take the daily wire down etc.

Basically.. fullblown transgender shadow activism.

But all of this shit would need financial funding. I don't have that kinda money. Nor would it be ethical. I don't know if we should care about ethics at this point. Thirdly it could make the situation worse by giving into the ""the wokes are attacking us"" mentality.

I don't know.

For riots we need to be united.
Me too. Standing in front of a tank without any weapon is a suicide. We have to fight, not to let them defeat us. And information war is still a war.
Unfortunately, Nazis are not afraid of anything short of physical violence. Often they aren't even afraid of that. These are scumbag, deplorable people who worship violence and murder and evil. They bathe in it. They drink it. They want to hurt you and everyone you love, and unless you're willing to put a bullet in them (assuming they attack you first and its self defense) they will put a bullet in you and think nothing of it whatsoever. And they figure, hey, if you fight back, they get to murder and beat you even harder, and then talk all about the deplorable violence of the ""trans agenda,"" while whitewashing their own mass murders and atrocities out of the picture. They engage in DARVO. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim Order. Deny that they are attacking you or that you are oppressed, attack you or your integrity, and reverse victim order to make themselves look like the oppressed victim, fighting for ""American values"" against the depraved, degenerate left. And the conservative right wing media is aiding and abetting them. Fox news and the daily wire are deplorable monstrosities who need to be punished. But there is no way to do so because they have a chokehold on the narrative about whose violence is legitimate and whose is not. AKA, Offensive violence by alt right fascist psychopaths? A-OK. Defensive violence by desperate trans folks just trying to survive to the next day? WOKE MOB. INTOLERANT LEFT.  


To be clear I am not endorsing physical violence here because it will only hurt our cause. As long as they control the propaganda machine and the narrative, neither violence nor non violence has any hope of working. The only way is to take control of the narrative first, to delegitimize their claim to legitimate violence.
We should unite. We can't work this while fractured. Do you have an idea on how we could get everyone together? A new Website, Forum, r/?

That's not at all what I'm saying.

I'm just trying to say we shouldn't resort to violence. That will only paint the targets on our backs even brighter.

Yes, talk, yes protest. But show them we do it peacefully and lovingly.
We need trans people to be a little less MLK, and a little more Malcom X.
I'm not saying that we stick our heads in the sand, at all, nor did MLK.

I'm saying let our voices AND actions represent peace as well as the disparity and discrimination we are facing.  Actions speak louder than words.  Let their own words prove them wrong by our peaceful, but vocally strong united peaceful existence
What is silly about anything I said about MLK?

I'm saying we have to fight our battles wisely, especially for future generations.  We can't get up in arms and expect them to return peace in response.
I respectfully disagree.  The militant movements were happening alongside his.  And he consistently disavowed the other approaches.  He always tried to make things peaceful.

I see what you're saying, but I sincerely don't think he levied, intentionally or not, the contrast to his advantage.

Do we really want to paint the targets on our backs even brighter?  I say we show them that we are normal, peaceful citizens, living normal, quiet lives, and let time prove we were in the right, for future generations.
MLK's life, not death, inspires many to keep pushing forward, peacefully.  His death catapulted his message to cement the inspiration, which rallies the African American rights movement forever. Whatever happened after his death, the riots, was contrary to his message of peace.

Who was more effective and represented the movement more, him or Malcolm X?  Put it this way, which person has a Federal Holiday?

Our trans community should let peaceful representation contradict the way we're being portrayed, and violence never works in the long run for ours or future generations.

As a side note, I'm shocked the mods of this thread are allowing a continuation of violence discussion on this sub.  Aren't you guys violating Reddit terms of service by allowing this discussion?

No offense at all to any of you who disagree with me.

It's just that I'd rather die a martyr and help future generations than elevate the hatred against us by resorting to violence or vandalism, and be painted as the enemy any more in the media.
Of course! I know the feeling. <3
Yeah it's getting ridiculous the closest state to me is OK and that's not any better might have to go FAR
Oof. Honestly though I really feel like alot of ignorance is bred from lack of exposure and I'd hate to have to run for my own safety I'd like to believe I could put up with any mild harassment.  Been tough finding a job though...
It isn’t weakness to care for about other people and not want to hurt them, even if they hurt you.

Edit: (written concurrently with the response about apathy) and, it’s not apathy to feel disinclined to act in a society that has shown again and again that you are individually powerless to change it.

But, we can and will and do change it, just by being here and sometimes by acting together. As gloomy as things are right now, things are happening and when I look around, I see trans people fighting. This darkness is going to have to get a hell of a lot darker to make us stop.
Sounds like peaceful methods are not an option...
Alt right isn't the majority here either, but it is a shit hole, I'll give you that.
>Your country are just a bunch of arseholes who are proud of smelling like the shit they are.

I remember Canadian users on here laughing in our fucking faces during the bleakest days of the Pandemic. Your countrymen are every bit as capable of being vile assholes as mine.
I mean... I'm a trans artist. I might f around and find out. But I stay off most social media, so we'd need a coordinator.
Well, you'd need something that can't be shut down easily. So an entirely new website would probably be the best bet. With decoy sites and forums here and there. Right now though, I think reddit will do the job. Also, i'd say that physical locations to talk and communicate is a good idea(although both physical and digital can be dangerous) kind of like what the civil rights movements in the 60-70-80s did.

But you also need to think about what and who you are fighting for, that way you can have true united values so the other side of the arguement can't exploit the lack of unity.
Thanks!
I'm saving this
that was great
Okay you can protest peacefully and lovingly if you want but they won't hear us, they'll laugh at us 

Because the ones in power only hear what the don't want to hear when their position is being threatened or when we make enough noise
Yes!  


Burn things make them pay hold them hostage until they see
Any means necessary.
Your complete misunderstanding and misrepresenting of Malcom X is paralleled by your misunderstanding of political power. He was a great man and doesn't deserve to have his accomplishments belittled by you because you're judging him by the standards of a white supremacist country.

This isn't about great men of history. This is about political movements. By breaking down the civil rights movements into separate figure heads and pitting them against each other, you're missing the whole. It doesn't matter wether or not the riots are what MLK stood for. No one man, moment, or action encapsulates an ever evolving political movement.

Violence against a violent system is a defense mechanisms. If the political structures around us prey upon us, it is only right that we defend ourselves by whatever means necessary. And there are going to be times when it's necessary. Self defense is never something to be ashamed of.
Right. I'm close to Oklahoma as well but I'm just down the road from Missouri.  I was actually thinking of moving to Springfield but I don't think it's going to be any better than Arkansas honestly. May have to go all the way to Colorado or Illinois. Colorado would be my first choice.
It isn't your job to educate them, you don't have to put that on yourself. At this point, they're wilfully ignorant. They know how to learn, and they know where to find information, they just don't want to. If they understood, they'd have to empathize, and they don't want to do that. They'd rather just sit in their echo chamber. If those laws pass, you're in direct danger.
that's apathy and the reason why we are so easily harassed and targeted we will never stand for ourselves if we have the whole don't fight back mentality. care about other people?? idk of u noticed this or not it's not like they exactly want us to be alive so why should we care im not gonna let someone roll over me and pretend to care about them
Peaceful is certainly preferable as all violence does is reinforce their propaganda narrative of ""trans bad."" But we also are under no obligation to stand back as a community while our people are shot to death in bars and on the streets, throw up our hands, and say ""there's nothing we can do.""

An armed guard or two at all lgbt establishments might just send the message that we're ACTUALLY serious about it never happening again.

Being trained in firearms and nonlethal self-defense for those who can, protecting each other by making sure our siblings don't walk home alone or go off with strange men with ill intent, protesting loudly and proactively! All of these tactics are necessary. Depending on our own community for protection is going to be necessary as the social conditions can change rapidly and the state doesn't always have the best interests of LGBTQIA+ folks at heart, to say the least. Only we can help us.
No we don't solve our problems but killing eachother. Unfortunately the toxicity is spreading.
If you resort to violence, you'll end up in jail.  Then, your voice will definitely not be heard, but rather used against you and us
Violence begets violence.  Period.

My comparison of Malcolm X to MLK is being misunderstood.  I don't disagree that Malcolm X was a man of recognition.  But, go ask anyone, who was more influential and effective?  I'm not misunderstanding.  I'm old and wise and know what doesn't work.

I spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm post-op trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.  Do you think I was able to do any good for our cause when I was in solitary confinement?  I had a pencil and one call a day, only to numbers I had memorized.  And, I was non-violent.  Violent people are treated way worse.  I saw it to be true of a ""neighbor"" in jail.

We should never resort to violence.  Our future generations will be the ones suffering more than us.


Again, mods, why are you not stopping all this encouragement of violence?  I'm pretty sure you're in violation of Reddit's terms of agreement.

And, to everyone else including my responder, stop encouraging violence.  I can promise, from living almost 50 years of American history, that you're painting us into a corner that we don't want!  Live for the future generations and quit misrepresenting us!

Don't be who our aggressors want us to be.  It serves us no good.
CO all the way. I still just wish things would change I live where I am by choice I moved back here after living in San Francisco, LA. Denver, some pretty open minded places. And I just love the area I'm in. :( mah home
We are already considered as bad, just for existing. 
I don't know how it looks like in the States, but here insults and radical statements aimed at minorities (incl. transgender people) are allowed by society (mostly using a mechanism of ""they are like that, we can't do anything""), but revenge measures of the same degree are considered an attack. Like we've initiated that when we are only answering to their attack. 

However, I agree.
Except when the ""problem"" is the indigenous population, in which case, it's totally normal to shove their kids into torture centers disguised as schools, where they die in appalling numbers, get shoved into mass graves, and then spend the next 100 years jerking off about how much more progressive you are than your neighbors.
When did I say we had to use violence? Please stop trying to twist my words, my comment literally says that we should protests and yell, I never even talked about being violentnagainst people

You were the one that said we should do things ""lovingly and peacefully "" wich i don't agree, because non-violent protests ≠ peaceful protests
Lmao, yeah, because it's not like the police won't raid our clubs on false pretenses if we just act nice and cordial.
St. Louis Illinois.  
On the Illinois side.  
I feel safe.  
But fear even that feeling of safety will be taken
Ok. If you want peace, let's advocate peace!
I've been to jail as a post-op trans woman, spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.

It's not fun. 

Your logic is broken, no offense.  They'll treat you way worse than they did me, if you resort to violence.

And violence would only work against us.  Don't resort to it.
>I've been to jail as a post-op trans woman, spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.

Do you think that has more to do with you being potentially violent or you being trans?
They told me it was because I've had surgery.  

They actually had two female officers inspect my genitalia and telling me why.

It was not due to violence on my part, but my protection.  I fully complied all along the way."	10ad3x2	trans	384	0.96	2023-01-12 22:37:56
Someone was outed at work. I think I did the right thing?	"I'm cis and newish at my workplace, and a fellow newish colleague told me and a small group of other new people that one of the senior staff members 'used to be a woman'. I obviously corrected them by saying 'you mean he's a trans man?', and everyone in the group agreed that trans men are men, and the standard basic stuff that someone says when they are accepting of trans people but don't really know how to say it in a natural way.

But I couldn't get over the fact that said trans staff member had been outed to me, and it felt like an invasion of his privacy. An older staff member who had been at the company for years had outed this man to a traine who would never have known if she wasn't told, and then she told more of us. Sadly I have some huge memory issues, so I knew the department the older lady works in but not her name to give to HR.

I spoke to my supervisor about it today, told her that I didn't know who knew that the colleague is trans and if he was happy for others to know or not. It turns out that he transitioned 4 years ago, and was with the company for years beforehand. So all the older staff know he is trans. She didn't know if he would be ok with other people telling the newer staff about his transition, but she is going to talk to a lady in HR and they might speak to him and see how he feels.

I think I did the right thing, as I don't know the guy and I would hate for him to have overheard something one day and be hurt! I think he has the right to privacy if he wants, and that he should be told if other staff members are outing him.

What would you want me to do in this situation if it was *you* who was being outed? I didn't know what the best thing to do was, but felt like I couldn't keep calling myself an ally if I didn't do *somthing* about this. I would have spoke to the man himslef, but he's so busy and rarely comes in my department, so it would have been difficult for me to talk to him.

Sorry for how long this is."	"You did the right thing to take it to HR. It's his business who knows or not, especially if you were told in a gossipy manner, which is what this sounds like.
Bravo to your trans coworker, regardless. Coming out is hard enough, but transitioning at work when people have known you one way for years? I don't have the balls for it.
At least this closet has some fantastic stuff in it...
As someone who was outed at work and actively makes my job experience shittier, you’re the cis co-worker I would’ve wished for. You are going to make his job experience a lot easier if you help stand up with him. Support in numbers really matters.
Definitely the right thing to take it to HR, it is no one’s place to disclose a persons former gender then the person themselves.
Totally did the right thing. That member of staff had no right to disclose that without the guy’s consent. That should result in a disciplinary for sure. I know plenty of colleges at my workplace know I’m trans as I transitioned while working there but still, I’d be livid if someone went round telling all the new staff members I was trans.
You’re all lucky that this sounds like an accepting environment, but outing a trans colleague could genuinely put them in danger if you have any other colleagues that are transphobic enough. You aren’t just protecting his privacy, but his safety, and that’s absolutely the right thing to do
You absolutely did the right thing. Your efforts in correcting the person who outed him, and bringing it to HR, are very appreciated. :)
I. Came out at work myself.  I would hope he came out ready for this and more. You never know what the reaction will be so you should prepare for most eventualities. Still that being said it is nice if you aren't outed uncontollably.  There were some extremists on my work team I would rather not know. Not because I am ashamed of who I am but because I don't trust them not to bully or turn violent.
I came out as trans at work a year ago and it has gone great. Everyone has been very supportive and use my new name and pronouns. It is a little strange though since I’ve known most of them for years as male.
OP thats real good of you, you didnt just do the good thing you did it in one of the best ways possible lemme just give you a quick virtual high five and transflag because thank you you are an amazing human being your positivity and well meaningness towards the trans community is just merfection and this post made me really happy

🙌🏳️‍⚧️
I think you did the right thing, so feel good about it.

In my case, I don't care at my current workplace. I'm way too visible in the company to hide it. It would be impossible to change all the documents and pictures and I'm not shy about it.

In fact, I think my coworkers are so nice that it has made the process slightly more awkward because I expected gossip to drastically cut down on the number of people I had to individually talk to.

You were 100% right though and a good ally. Thank you!!!
Sounds like you did everything the right way
As someone who came out and still works at the same place, nothing pisses me off more than having another coworker who was around before hand tell a new employee my past history
He works in a business ran by and staffed by mostly older people too, and while some older people can be so nice, it's no secret that older generations aren't always understanding of trans people.
I was so afraid to come out at work. But everyone was so supportive of me. My name was updated on most of our systems relatively quickly, everyone started using my name and pronouns, and it was like the ""old me"" never existed and I'd been me all along.

I understand I am extremely lucky to have a supportive team and most people aren't quite as lucky as me. I hope if you ever do decide to come out at work that it goes as smoothly for you as it did for me. <3
Im about to come out to my work colleagues but I've only been there for a year so they should be okay with it
I'm sorry that you went though that, no one should be outed and I hate that people still do this!!

I'm glad that you think I can help, I was worried that I'd be getting involved where it's not my place, but the comments on here make me so glad I spoke up.
Thank you. It's a shame that I don't have the name of the older staff member, I think they'll have to ask the trainee that told me.

Neither of them should have told anyone.
We are so lucky that the people we work with mostly so accepting, and even the ones that aren't would never get physical. But like you said it's still such a big safty issue!!

We're in the UK so trans rights aren't really doing great in this country overall right now.
I didn't want to sound like I thought he should be ashamed or hide anything, I tried to make it very clear to my supervisor that my only problem with the situation was that he wasn't able to tell people himself, or even know who had been told.

I hope you are ok at work. I know extremists wouldn't be accepted where I am but it's such a shame that every place isn't like that.
Yup. Precisely. The fact I work primarily with an older demographic is a large part of my own motivations, so again, I say bravo.
Thank you. I've changed my preferred name at work to a variation of my middle name, so it isn't THAT strange, and the name itself is pretty gender neutral. But the wide dissemination as to WHY I want to change it ... that's under wraps. Not sure I want people at work to know. It's so stupid and complicated to be FTM and be older, with children, in a perfectly functional marriage...I'm happy for the relief to know and finally start liking myself as myself, but there's a big part of me that wishes I hadn't discovered this. Life was so much easier five months ago when I was just kinda unhappy and couldn't define why. ((not trying to usurp the thread, sorry for the pity party, stupid Mondays)).
I just want to add and say same here! There is so much bad news in trans communities I want to add another example of coming out at work going very well.
Congrats! I'd like people to hear more positive stories because I've had a similarly positive experience and others can too.

I've worked there for well over a decade prior to coming out and I think part of the reason I've stayed is that we're all very accepting people.
You sound a LOT like me. Very similar circumstances, but the relief outweighed the downsides for me.

I'm 51 (almost 5 months HRT, full time for a few months prior), with grandkids, a long career and a loving, supportive wife. Sure, she was understandably a little freaked out at first, but once she understood that it was about my self image and not wanting to leave her, she really came around and has been wonderful.

As I mentioned elsewhere, my office was very supportive. I've managed zero negative reactions so far (knock on wood) but I like to think that I've also picked only good people to be part of my life.
No you're fine don't worry. We're all here to share our experiences and yours is just as important as ours. If I can give you some perspective from someone who's come out, though (I know you're FTM which is essentially the opposite of me but I imagine some parts of it translate well?): It's definitely hard at first. Worrying every time you tell someone is mentally exhausting. I spent the first few months in a constant state of panic that the next person I tell will be disgusted by who I am. In the end, for me at least, it was absolutely worth it, and I hope, if you ever do decide to come out at work, that it goes well for you too. <3
I'm glad you had a good experience <3 it's nice to have a little bit of light in this dark world we live in once in a while
That's wonderful, I'm so glad you had a great experience too! I love hearing positive stories because even if they're not the norm, it gives me hope that the world will be more accepting within our lifetimes.
Thank you. It's a process for sure. I'm not sure how much I want to reveal to anyone at this point because I'm not on HRT and my hubby's indicated that would be a pretty solid dealbreaker, so I'm avoiding it if I can. I've had ""top"" surgery planned for years anyway because of my breast cancer risk so I'm sure when that's done the conversation will pretty much be had for me. We'll see. Just taking each day one at a time!
I'm sorry to hear about your husband. :( I personally wouldn't be able to stay with someone who didn't support my decision but that's my own personal opinion. And you don't owe anyone any information about your personal life if you don't want to give it. <3 I hope everything goes well for you :)
Thanks, I appreciate that. Onward!"	ulwekl	trans	378	0.99	2022-05-09 17:25:17

Does anyone else get realy jelous and resentful of cis family members?	"Like when i look at my brother i find myself thinking ""that could have been me"" or when i heard the baby my dad is having with my step mom is a boy i felt this weird feeling of anger, sadness and dread"	"Personally, my biggest source of dysphoric jealousy has been other trans people who managed to start HRT in their early teen years and pass effortlessly. Sometimes I see timelines of people who started at 15 and are now my age (22/23), and they look just like a cis girl, and I just think to myself ""what's the point of even trying if I'll never look like her? If I'll never get to relive my teen years as a girl""? I know this type of mindset is toxic and horrible, I know passing shouldn't necessarily be the end goal, and I don't *want* to be jealous and bitter, I *want* to be supportive and happy for these people who get to transition and live as their true self from a really young age, but I don't know *how*. Maybe I just need to get the poison hormones out of my brain first, I don't know.
I think I did as a child (but couldn’t articulate the feeling of envy). I don’t so much now.
Hi. I'm FtM. I was jealous that my cis little brother got to have super hero undies as a kid. 😆 He has the masc equivalent of my birth name. And we've always been close. I kinda thought of him as me if I'd been AMAB. 

😓 But... the real true envy and resentment that gnawed at my soul for 2+ decades...

I was super envious of my cis step sister. We met as I was starting female puberty. Shes 2 years older than me. Its weird but I was jealous that I just couldn't seem to make myself be a girl like she was. It was just so easy for her to be a girl. 

It took 26 years (yep, I mathed), therapy and starting my transition to make that revelation.
I also feel like this, I have 3 AMAB brothers and then there's me, why couldn't I also be like them?
I'm a trans woman. My sibling, who is 10, is showing all the signs of being a trans boy. I obviously love and support him, but I can't stop a part of my brain from resenting him a little for, sort of, ""throwing away"" womanhood when it's what I've always wanted, even if I didn't know it.

It's a stupid thought and I hate it, but we unfortunately can't control how we feel.
There's also jealousy of those who have been bold and together enough, knowing themselves enough, to explore their gender identity and do it honestly.... As an older cis amab I am just in awe of trans folk who take control of their own self identity so much as to be themselves despite social expectations and pressure. It may be that op could have been sibs that are jealous too for completely mirrored reasons. Just a thought. :)

Edit: Also wanna validate OPs feelings btw. Even as cis I get how that's gonna happen.
I'm currently in the process of grieving that childhood I never got. 
While my older brother was playing soccer I was stuck in ballet. 
When we went to the lake or camping my dad taught my brother to skip rocks and whistle with blades of grass while what my dad taught me was to make flower crowns. (I cried in the tent on camping trips when I knew people were asleep)
My brother did robotics I did girl scouts
Walking past the bathroom seeing my dad teach my brother to shave(this one hit the hardest)

It took me a while to not hate my brother for living so easily. Even before I knew I was trans the fact he could date a girl and talk to our parents as though it was normal and I had to hide it because I didn't know if mom and dad liked gay people.

But he's been the one to teach me the things I never learned as a kid from our dad, though I don't know if he realizes the significance to me. He taught me how to shave my face when I came out to him in highschool, he taught me to skip a rock, to whistle with grass, hell he even taught me when to leave a relationship with a girl who's toxic. My brother has always been my biggest supporter and I don't think he even realizes. While I may never have the experience of a cis man i hope that someday I will accept and even enjoy the childhood I did have. 

The second I came out. He started calling me his brother. And I couldn't be more grateful for that.
Definitely. I feel the same with my oldest brother. It’s come to the point where I can’t tell if his style is genuinely what I like, or if I’m just trying to copy him out of spite. Optimistically, I’d like to think the former.
I used to. I have a cousin about half a year older than me I was very close with growing up and it was agonizing to see him go through puberty and get all the things I wanted (I.e. height, facial hair, deep voice) while I went through the wrong puberty. 

Now that I'm an adult and I've had time to come to terms with who I am, how I look and my version of masculinity, I don't get jealous anymore. I'm who I am and I've learned that's just fine. I think for a lot of trans people you'll reach that acceptance later in life and it won't seem so horribly unfair anymore.

And personally, I think cis boys ought to be jealous of *me*. 💅
I feel so bad about it because my cousin has been one of my biggest supporters but he gives me such a ridiculous amount of gender envy. 

He wore a suit for a special occasion once and all I could do was compare what I looked like in a suit and it made me want to scream.
I get ya, everytime I see my sister brush her ponytail, I think “ I wish I can do that too” or when she wears a cute dress, I get jealous too
No don’t really feel anything except if they disrespect me.   But i hear your angle “that could have been me”.   Best to just come to terms with yep, I agree, but it was hasn’t and that’s the hard truth.    Also you are a very special and unique person and have special traits and qualities this cis people don’t have and will never understand.
All the time. Basically, I'm jealous of almost every cis guy. Especially if they take their shirts off or something. Makes me wish I could do that.
Not personally cus I'm the hotter brother lol. If I were raised a guy I wouldn't be me.
Family members? Not at all.
The source of most of my dysphoria comes from feminine men and mlm relationships I see on social media
My sisters were both gorgeous as teens, and I was a masculine potato. I’m MtF, and being half as pretty of my sisters is this horribly unhealthy goal in the back of my head, and layered under that is trying to outshine them.

In addition to that is the crushing sadness that I waited until I was 28 to start HRT when I had a way to get black market HRT in HS. So yeah, I get it.
Most of my cousins are girls and I get mad gender envy from them so yeah…..
Yeah, I get really sad when I see cis men because I think about how easy their lives are and how I wish I had that ease of living.
yes i feel bad about it too 😭😭
All the time with my sister
My sister lol
Not anymore. I realized being jealous and resentful wasn't fair towards them and those emotions weren't helping me in any sort of way.
Your dad came wrong, and it's all been downhill from there  
(Context is that the sex chromosome the dad gives determines the ""sex"" of a child, kind of? in the most common instances the father gives an X, making an afab individual, or a Y chromosome, making an amab)
Yes.
Yes, especially after my sis was born. When I was a teen I kept wishing I could have been her instead. 

Then afterwards it was seeing younger cis women in their 20’s. THAT hit me the hardest. Both jealousy from how young and pretty they were to knowing, “damn that could/should have been me.”

It took a long time to make it past those thoughts. Occasionally it still gets me. But there’s nothing I can do, except try and be who I am now. Not who I wished I could have been.
I’ve become ruthless about letting go of things that don’t serve me, and jealousy doesn’t.
I'm glad I'm nothing like my selfish sister.


My cousins on the other hand....they are gorgeous and I wish I could have been any one of them.
I've never had this. Im the second oldest of 5 (2 boys) and I'm the only trans one (but my 12 year old sibling is dropping hints that they're at least NB). Im like 12 years older than my brother and he was just a baby when I came out and I started transitioning before he hit puberty. (I accidently chose his middle name as my name i had no idea 🙈). I've never felt jealous... Thats his life and it has nothing to do with me and how he treats his gender identity isn't gonna impact me. If he wasn't born a boy I'd still be trans. This might be different if I was one of the younger kids tho, I could totally see how jealousy would form if I could see my brother grow up into what I wanted before I could start my transition.
I can relate
Not really resentful but definitely very jealous of my sister. I find myself wishing ""Why couldn't I be just like you?""
I started ttansition at 29 almost 30 anfd sometimes it gets bad but sometimes i do pass and i sometimes wish that i had started early
Ummm not really towards family when I see some girls(hope this don’t sound weird or creepy) but I do get bit envy of them cuz of them being a girl and having a nice feminine body that I wish I had
I get jealous of most women i see period
got the same situation going on with the dad/step mom having a baby brother atm, and i just feel like shit. im so jealous. its not my dads/stepmoms nor the babies fault, but it still hurts so much. i wish that was me.
Everyday! Happens with friends too
Yes especially in public
Yup I always feel bad when I do, its just sometimes I just get so fucking \[\[gender envy\]\]   
I very much do not dislike my family it's just something that happens
Honestly yes,all the time. It's maddening when I have to struggle so hard to pass and have media and the world around me question my very right to be alive. It's toxic,but I do look at cis women but blissfully living my best life. Literally just BORN with everything I could ever want. I daydream of everyone in the world swapping gender overnight,just so they would learn some empathy on that dysphoria feels like.
It's normal what you're feeling however.. but.. when we feel jealous.. I think it's important to just aknowledge it and feel it for what it is. Try to focus on being grateful. I've met so many strong people who wish they were born with all their limbs, or without severe disability. Some people don't have all their senses. I get jealous too.. could it have been better? Absolutely..but it could be worse too . Everyone has things they dislike about themselves, and Earth is all RNG anyway. Nobody got to create their character in this bothersome game.
I get it when I see other trans girls breasts...or just breasts in general...the jealousy is OVERWHELMING because although I do have breasts, they're tubular and look weird. Like Oh great of course I'd get the short stick
ive always been jealous of my brother for being born cis, but since we grew up in the same room as kids i got to try ""boy"" games, clothes and hobbies that i wouldn't have had the chance to try if we weren't as close... im still really thankful for the freedom being close to him gave me, but the jealousy of seeing him grow into the man i always dreamt of being really hurt.
Starting HRT made this feeling worse for me. But as my body has started to change its gotten better.   Also at 23 you still have a very good chance to pass after some time. I just try to keep telling myself it's not too late and to be grateful I figured this out as early as I did (I definitely had the feeling as a kid but living in a rual area didn't give me any support to figure out who I was) . I was 25 when I started so don't loose hope! It's not consistent yet (voice consistently is hard lol) but I'm starting to pass quite often after 6 months of hrt.

And I know therapy isn't the only answer but feelings like I missed my child/teen years, wanting to carry my child, and other super toxic thoughts that transition hasn't helped me with are definitely getting overwhelming. I hope I can find someone I feel comfortable talking about these things too but finding a therapist who is good and affordable is impossible 😑
[deleted]
i think this happens with everyone. pretty sure that most trans people wish they had realized and came out earlier no matter if they did at 10 or 30. I’m 18 (i came out at 17) and i always wish i knew what i was feeling as a young kid like some of the trans people i know.
I transitioned at 24 (28 now) and the best way I cope is just trying to put it into perspective. There's always a bigger fish. There's always someone who's going to transition earlier, be prettier, and get to live more of their lives as their true selves.

4-5 years ago, 24 was considered pretty young to start, now different places are granting teens puberty blockers, and transitioning before you're 20 is the ""new young transitioning age"".

My brother is a transboy (only 15) and he's busting to start, but has a myriad of physical and mental health problems preventing it. I wish he read this stuff and realised his time isn't running out, he's got heaps more to look forward to. 

You do you at your own pace. We can't go faster than our own limits and we shouldn't punish ourselves for that.
I'm even jealous of people who start late and have significant breast growth 3 months in...

Here I am a year and a half in with nothing.
I've had to work against those same feelings for different things.  What helps me is reminding myself that there are people who are older wishing they could have done xyz in their 20s.  We still have our youth.

And I wish someone had told me this sooner so I wasn't feeling jealous of kids who had a better roll of the die as long as I have.
There’s always an odd man out.
One of my best friends from HS is a trans woman. She came out in our 20s. And me in late 30s. When I told her about me, she didnt understand at all! She's like but you're everything I ever wanted to be! I totally understand, bc I felt the same about her for a while.
It's not passing in general I'm worried about. It's about passing effortlessly without any makeup, to be able to put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and still look unquestionably female, to be able to fit cis women's clothing and not have this huge rectangular rib cage. I know passing is very possible for me, maybe even without make up since I don't have a *super* masculine face as it is, but I don't want to have to put in effort for it, I just want to *be*. Again, I know passing shouldn't be what's important, and I know this isn't a healthy mindset to have, but I'm just not sure how to get over it.

Yeah, no country seems to have figured out mental health care yet. I hope you find what you're looking for soon ❤️ You can DM me if you want, cause I really relate to a lot of that
Trans people have a good chance of “passing” outside of their 20’s, regardless. 

I started at 36. Hormones have done me well. Ffs will carry me the rest of the way.
I'm 28 haven't started yet and there are many people on r/TransLater who are even older and at various stages of transition journey.
Thank you ❤️ I was never very thoughtful about my gender as a kid, and I didn't understand the sudden onset of depression and brain fog in my teen years to be dysphoria, so I don't know how my parents would have reacted had I come out to them then. As it is, I came out to them last year, and they just didn't believe me cause they never noticed any ""signs"" when I was younger and just invalidated everything I said. I'm so sorry you had to go through that and worse at 13! I hope you're better and stronger now because of it. I'm hoping to be able to start HRT within the next few months, so now I'm just praying for good genes 🙏

I wish you all the best ❤️
I found that just telling yourself over and over again that your troubles aren't important and they are just unhealthy isn't going to help. Because it is very normal to feel like that. I feel you there on a painfully personal level. Not in my 20s yet but due to a lot of situations and circumstances I really have, genuinely no idea whenever I'd even get in a situation to be able to apply for any HRT treatment, and even though friends praise my rare selfies that I'm brave enough to share, looking at my body from shoulders to toe I'm a lot of the time just, scared, from the thought that I may never get anything close to what I want
But you know, I just want to tell you this to kinda give you context of where I am coming from. Point is, telling yourself that the way you feel is not right and you have to get over it is what I tried for ages to no avail. I think that the best way to say it is simply you have to accept that you feel like this. Those are your feelings, very natural feelings that humans have, and feeling like that is just a part of you. Don't resent those feelings just, accept how they are a thing, try to avoid situations where it could be getting too intense, and when the situation requires it try to put them to the side, but at the end of the day you can easily acknowledge ""man I was kinda jealous of that person"". Heck, if you have people you can trust, you can maybe try and confide in them. See what they can tell you about it, I promise a true friend would never deflect your heart's pains as ""just a negative mindset""

Sorry if what I said was too much too sudden I just, really related to what you said here and a tiny part of me was just wishful that whatever I have to say may be able to ease your pain a bit
You give me hope at 28 hoping to start in next few years.
Thank you. That really does help a lot ❤️ It's nice to have those feelings validated a bit, cause I see so much discourse around those types of feelings ""perpetuating misogyny"" and there's nothing more to it. Although I do agree it's important not to set impossible goals for yourself, it's hard to shake the feeling that those goals *were* once realistic for me, but the chance was stolen from me. I just need to be able to feel that without feeling guilty.
You queen are valid as fuck, and so are your feelings <3 so yeah I wish you as successful of a HRT as possible it is
Thank you so so much 😭 been having a pretty shit time lately as well, so I really needed this ❤️

I wish you all the best, girlie 💋

Being mtf has unlocked emotions?	I was never really able to express my emotions before. Like something sad would happen and I’d feel it but I wouldn’t cry or anything, even when I should. I felt emotionally numb sort of. But one of the first things I noticed when starting hormones was just how expressive my emotions were getting. Not only will I cry when something sad happens. But I’ll also cry when I saw a cute video of some puppies. Is this normal??? 🤔 Idk, but I love it. 😊	"I've felt the same way (emotionally numb) all my life, and I thought I was crazy. Thank you, I'm happy knowing someone else went through that
I feel this. My emotions are a lot more intense now, and they feel more right. I'm not a big cryer, but I cry a lot more than I used to. I can feel happiness now, which I barely felt at all before HRT.
My ass thought she was sociopath! Turns out I just had the wrong hormone in me this whole time!
Honestly the biggest thing I'm looking forward to with starting E is being able to cry again. It's so hard for me to cry right now and it's sooooo frustrating. I remember being able to when I was a kid, and I know it might sound weird, but I miss that release, y'know?
This one me also! Group hug!
I’ve also noticed that recently! And I haven’t even started HRT yet!
Even without them cause i start next week when I came to terms and accepted being trans I found emotions for the first time in ever. Its amazing and confusing to have them and to feal alive
Bruh. I've been grieving for everything I've never grieved before, and felt every single emotion I never felt all at once.

It was overwhelming.
If you talk to FTM guys, often theyl say they found it physically harder to cry, biologically speaking, Ina situation where they'd cry before.

Obviously a lot of it is just toxic ""men don't cry"" masculinity, but there is probably some biological element to it as well
Welcome to the world of estrogen
Was driving the other day and I started crying while listening to a song. So dumb, but I also love how emotional I have become.
I have found it easier to cry and I am so much more grateful for it. I also scream in fear more which is an interesting side effect 😅
It's not linked to HRT, it's because you finally get to be yourself !
I've been on hrt for about 3 weeks and that's exactly how it feels! I was so numb before and now I can cry if I want
Yeee. For me I just kept it all to myself and I think I only cried once but now I feel like more things or idk. There isn’t any month where I don’t cry now haha and I love like being vulnerable to my friends because they try to help me and it helps or idk.
suppressing emotion is an egg thing ?👀 i think mine needs to crack more :(
Saaaaame. I haven't cried for 10 years. And then I started HRT and just became a ball of emotions... That's crazy
What!! Women have emotions?!! I only know one, anger... Can I be a woman, please?
The last time I cried was for dysphoria, but your post give me hope. Thanks ❤️
I'm FtM and honestly, I used to be so Emotional, I started T and now I'm sorta emotionless, so it's not just MtF, I can hardly cry anymore
All this time I thought there was something wrong with me.
Its normal you are riding a difere emotional Dragon, with thine you will come to be able to ride it well. But yeas is amazing to have emotions or new ones.
I haven’t started hormones yet so I can’t speak from personal experience but my trans cousin described it as subconsciously not masking anymore. Harsh gender binaries harm everybody involved.
Wait till your doc throes progesterone into the mix
I hate being numb, I wish I could just move out and transition and actually feel happy or sad.
My mother died 3 days ago. I cried briefly, for about a minute, after getting the phone call that she was going to be gone in less than a few days. Then again I shed a tear or two on the way to the store right after.

When she passed. Nothing. My emotions are intense and complex but on the surface I am calm.

I remember the day I stopped crying. I've hated it ever sense and never moreso than this week. I've been very on the fence about things like hrt since only just figured myself out maybe 2 months ago... but if I were to go that route, reclaiming expression of my emotions would be one of the biggest reasons. 

I WANT to weep for my mother. I feel like a monster that I'm more calm than my friends about her passing.
I haven't even started HRT yet, but I definitely have seen improvement with my emotions.  


Even though it's starting to be more common for men to express emotions without being judged, there still is that stigma behind it.
I haven’t even started hormones and my emotions are heightened because for the first time in decades I’m not repressing them!
oww this happened the same with me, and my blowed when i learn that trans woman have something like periods, with the amotion the mamas and etc without the part of blood and theses things impossible to us, but yeah i even say ""Im in that part of the month"", like cry for nothing or just being very happy and crying, the emotion have a new meaning to me now after i start HRT
Literally this for me. I've been on hormones for five years now, and I've cried more in those five years than I ever did in my previous life.  
I think part of it might be personally fulfillment and moving past emotional numbness, but I also think it's partly to do with how society socializes boys.  
Crying is honestly so euphoric to me, I have to explain to my partners that when I'm crying, it's not always a bad thing. I'm just happy to be able to express my emotions in a healthy way.  
Best of luck to you OP!
Yesterday a one year old great dane puppy came up to me and was so adorable I thought I was going to cry lol. I think its normal
Yeah it’s normal, I would literally cry while holding a kitten bc I loved it so much lol
I haven't started HRT yet, but hopefully will soon.

How I currently experience emotions is a bit like being a museum with my emotions being exhibits locked in glass boxes. I can see its there, but I can't get to it, all I can do is look in from the outside. Sometimes the glass thinner or thicker, more or less opaque, but it's always there preventing me from truly feeling. My first kiss? Yep, that joy was glassed away. When my cat of 18 years passed away a couple of years ago? That grief was in an exhibit box with a ""No touching"" sign on it in the museum of my emotions.

Of course, the one exception to this is one of the most masculine emotions: anger. I don't get angry often, but when I do, it feels oh so very real.

Hopefully HRT is the key to unlocking these boxes. Who knows, maybe it opens other doors too?
Yeah it’s amazing! I love being able to express emotions when I’m supposed too now! 😅 (and also when It’s just something cute)
Saaaaaaaaaaaame
this. im not a happy person, but i definitely feel things in a more 'me' way now. ive always been a cryer, but its like i can actually understand myself now, rather than just feel
absolutely. i think when it comes to others, we sometimes get too caught up in 'this person is crying i must fix them' rather than the why, as if its the crying we're trying to stop, rather than being there for whats hurting that person crying. crying is a release i feel is important too, with a really strange stigma (?ig?)
This is so true! After I accepted being trans it was like years of emotions came flooding in that I hadn’t realised I had been repressing. Definitely a shock.
This is interesting because I think I've felt a little more grief lately too. For things in the past I didn't really have the capacity to grieve before. It's all still blurry though. Kinda feels like I'm dusting off a fossil. I can see an outline of maybe what it is, but can't quite tell exactly yet.
I wanna be able to cry 😭😭😭
Same! I sometimes feel close, then nothin'.
aaaaaa same :(( gimme emotions"	sowpg8	trans	349	0.98	2022-02-10 03:48:07
The Trans Whisperer	"Just needed a place to vent. Someone made me incredibly insecure today and kind of down, let's call him 'the trans whisperer'. The conversation started pretty normally though we quickly started talking about me being a transgender woman.

Right from the get-go he told me **all** his trans friends really regret doing SRS, feeling it has mutilated them unnecessarily, and lots of issues with it. He kept giving me lots of helpful(?) advice; eating habits, physical activity, etc. We got to talking about my love life. He advised me again, telling me if I want to find love I should learn to outclass women. He called my face cute but with a couple of surgeries I'll look *perfect*. He has a trans flatmate and he says that his advice helped her with her gender dysphoria and from committing suicide and having great legs.

He made me a bit angry, mostly sad. I don't even know why. I just felt somewhat unpleasant during the whole interaction, I blocked him cause I felt he was doing me no good despite the great help he might have given to this trans flatmate and friends.

I don't agree I need to outclass women to be loved. I felt somewhat objectified and I did tell him that being objectified is a trigger for me for some negative emotions and memories.

Am I being hysterical by my reaction or have I just invalidated my feeling? And why can't I just easily let his words go? :(

[This is me, for context](https://preview.redd.it/n7lr2jxwsk871.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=afb66ab27616cb16e2f6bea41f5c9e94e595d6e7)"	"Wow. First off, it's rude to give unsolicited advice. Secondly, it's specifically bad for you and you told him as such, so he knowingly harmed you, at least obliquely. And lastly, it's misogynistic advice that is objectifying: your value as a woman doesn't come from your sexual attractiveness to his demographic, regardless of whether your trans or cis. 

And even if that is true for *all* the trans people he met, I think his behavior is probably exerting a very strong selection bias among the trans people he knows. As in, I can't imagine any trans people who disagree with this behavior keeping themselves around him for very long.

You're a beautiful woman! Don't fret about one man's opinion: it never did a lady any good.

EDIT: sorry, assuming your gender from context clues. But besides, you're a beautiful person and you have value regardless of who oggles you.
>He called my face cute but with a couple of surgeries I'll look perfect.

Woah woah woah..

🚩🚩🚩

That is the type language that a predator would use.
First, you are beautiful 😘 2nd, it sounds like he was projecting to me!
He is the one that needs to have surgery. He should have 2 ribs removed so he can blow himself.

You, you're fucking hot. Not that anyone's opinion matters, but I would rate you somewhere between ""what's your ring size?"" and ""where have you been all my life?""
He sounds really gross, and you're lovely. Shit reminds me of 'negging', incels trying to knock women that are out of their league down a peg. You're WAY out of his league.
I think this asshole was gaslighting you and I think you should take everything he said with an enormous grain of salt and assume that he was lying to manipulate and hurt you.
Projecting as in all the things he was telling you he wanted for himself. He is insecure. Had nothing to do with you. Does that make sense?
Is that ""transplaining"" ?
Oh honey, you look wonderful. You don't need to ""Outclass Women"" because you are a woman. (fuck you look way cuter that I do, I'm pre-everything) His advice may have helped a flatmate, but at the end off the day (I'm assuming) he's still cis. He doesn't fully understand the trans experience.
It’s called cis-splaining and it’s incredibly offensive. You’re absolutely right to feel violated. This person was not an ally, they were being emotionally abusive.
You are fine as YOU want to be. I would have argued back and walked out part way through his convo
Girl you are perfect the way you are!
Don’t let this asshole get under your skin. 
Everything he said is so cringy it makes me nauseous🤢 Definitely predatory behaviour. You made a good call by blocking this scumbag.

You are beautiful and let no one convince you otherwise!!💕
That guy sounds like a creep, the statement “your face looks cute but with a few surgeries it will look perfect” is a massive warning sign
Honestly, most of the things he said were *so* rude. An like they assume all trans people are the same. I probably would have blocked him early on in the convo. You did the right thing for you
trans whisperer holy cringe
You look bomb he’s a hoe
You were definitely talking to a chaser. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. The whole talking about being ""better than women and not getting SRS""
What a fetishizing asshat.
First of all, I wanted to thank ya'll for being so so supportive and validating my suspicions, that he's an enormous asshole. It's been a journey, a long and arduous one, to get to this point where such men just cause destabilize me and not fully break me down. I still have a long way to go to fix all the damage men like him done to me in my past.

I also wanted to thank everyone for letting me see the things I was totally oblivious to - the emotional manipulation and/or abuse, gaslighting, predatory behavior, being a manipulative chaser, etc. I have very little walls up, I guess I need to be much more vigilant then in order to make sure I don't let any bad actors in.

And ya'll are so right, I am beautiful and cute the way I am 🥰 I **like** being curvy and voluptuous. I don't need to outclass women and to wear so much makeup all day my face hurts or high heels until my feet don't walk no more. I don't need to be more woman than woman if I ever hope to find love, love's gonna find me and like me as I am or love can go fuck himself behind a dumpster for all I care. So thanks also for this confidence boost I was a bit lacking in today 🙏
Imma just say you look absolutely gorgeous. Sending virtual hugs 🤗
Lol the ""trans whisperer""? Nah, this fuckboy is the Trans Creeper.
Omg girl, from the first few lines that person is ""hidden toxic pile"" they try to shower with weird compliments/advice with random remarks to make you feel inferiour.
You are right. He is wrong. He is causing damage. You are trying to live your life. Nothing else is important. I hope you can heal <3
Sounds like a chaserloll
Sounds like he's a vapid biased asshole that thinks he knows everything. My advice is, don't take any of his advice and do what you think is best.
Advice is fine when it’s PROMPTED. That advice was rude, invasive and triggering. As for legs? Not gonna lie yours looks fucking amazing. If men don’t want you then those men can go fuck themselves.
The only helpful advice I can offer is not to listen to people who tell you that you are in any way imperfect. Those people have a lot to say and quite frankly are only doing it for their own benefit, this isn't some competition where you need to win anything. Even if you were literally the ugliest person on earth, you don't owe it to anybody to ""fix"" yourself or become ""Perfect"" just to fit in, especially under the excuse that's it's for your benefit and not theirs.
Also, the reason you can't let it go is because of anger. Anger always keeps you from letting go of unjust and unfair treatment, which is good, because it helps you remember what makes you a person that you care about over a person that they care about fir their egotistical or traditional or whatever other beliefs
Ew… he sounds like a narcissist.
I’m so sorry that happened to you. I’m glad it didn’t go any further but just the exchange alone I’m sure felt violating. He most definitely just thought you would be easy to manipulate and then probably would’ve tried to have sex with you. A lot of men do this to women unfortunately. Good on you for blocking his ass. I wouldn’t respond to him ever again if he tries to come
back on an alternate account, I don’t care how many times he apologizes or whatever he may say to get you to lift your boundaries. Dude sounds downright predatory just by you saying the subject quickly shifted to being about your transness. He knew exactly what his objective was before the conversation even started, I assure you.

As far as if you’re being hysterical.. no. Your reaction is normal. That is called emotional manipulation. The things he was saying to you were supposed to evoke a certain response from you. He was preying on your insecurities and I am so sorry about that :( 
People who do these kinds of things are deadass scum. 
Some things I think may help to try and get these thoughts out of your head is to surround yourself with positive energy, positive people. People that make you feel good or that care about you. It may sound cliche but do some positive self talk as well, I think it’s important to practice being kind to yourself and talking to yourself in a loving way. It’s easier said than done for sure but it’s something I definitely strive to be better at. 
I also recommend perhaps doing something stimulating that will distract you when the thoughts seem to never stop, something you enjoy. It will help keep you in the present moment.
You are perfectly fine just yourself. Don't let creeps like that tell you how you should be
Wow, nothing about that exchange sounds at all normal or appropriate. I feel really scared for the mental health of his flatmate and other trans “friends”, guarantee he is bullshitting you or even himself on how much he’s genuinely helped them if this is how he behaves.

I’d sooner believe he is the reason they “regret” srs, since he’s so critical of peoples bodies, choices and lifestyles, he probably says similar things to others. Imagine having to live with him? I’d say anything to get him to shut up, “guess I’m not trans anymore” included.
I find it best to never listen to anyone, positive or negative, when someone begins saying stuff just remember it's actually just an isolated brain firing off neurons (sometimes neurotic neurons) full of some isolated opinions...or just repeating things they've heard and felt comfortable repeating. But the trick is to ignore both, the compliments and the critiques. To be ""others-opinions-agnostic"" and reassert your own opinion and feelings as the only ones that really matter.

It's nice when people are supportive, but if you allow yourself to be too moved by even these, it's also giving yourself ""permission"" to be moved by the negative and hateful as well.  And all of that is just my own opinion isolated in my own soup of neurons influenced by my own isolated life and/or experiences.

EDIT: Another opinion of mine: You are fucking beautiful.
why the fuck are you listening to anyone with ""he"" pronouns on any of these topics fuck that motherfucker he's probably a goddamned chaser who wants you to keep the dick so he can get to it. nah sis ditch this fool.
I have no idea why men always feel the need to tell everyone how they should live, but you look fine to me sis. :)
Seems like this ""trans whisperer"" is on a big ego trip. I'm sorry you had to go through that.  He sounds like a total creep.
All his ""advice"" is bullshit I bloody PROMISE you you're the only actual trans person he knows and all his ""experiences"" with them are made up whole cloth. DO NOT IN ANY WAY allow that buffoon to make you feel insecure because YOU are the trans woman therefore in ANY conversation with a cis dude about trans stuff you are and will ALWAYS be the expert in the discussion. Understood?
Sounds like he's trying to control and/or manipulate you. Be careful with those types! I wouldn't take any advice at face value, without double/triple checking it and doing your own research, even from someone who you think may be trustworthy. From your post, it seems like he's not someone you fully trust, which is a huge red flag. Whatever you decide to do, at the end of the day you want to be sure it's *your* decision and not someone else's. Take care and be safe!
I like the thing on your door behind you. It makes you look like you have wings.
Jesus fucking Christmas NO you are not overreacting. That guy is a fucking C.R.E.E.P. Tall about mansplaining hot damn. 
Like, remove the trans aspect for a second. Do you think thats a normal conversation? Telling someone they need surgery to find love? Advising someone of their medical conditions that you have no experience with? 
Crazy!
What a jerk first of all! You are absolutely gorgeous baby!  I wouldn’t change a thing 
if I were you! Well, maybe one thing! I’d be in that picture with you! With your hand in mine, 
I’d be staring into those two beautiful eyes of yours and telling you how beautiful I thought 
you were and how lucky I was just to be standing there with you!
How do you get someone to stop giving you 1 million % unsolicited advice? They just are relentless and will not stop.
Thank you so much ❤️

I might have really paid him no mind but a few bad run-ins with men lately cause me to somewhat destabilize 🙈 hope I'll get better very soon, I have a queer quiz to host tomorrow, and emotional hormonal crying is not part of the show. 

And yes, I'm a transgender woman, you assumed correctly 🥰
Yes, THIS. That's negging/grooming language.
RIGHT?!
Oh, didn't quite thought of that. Sort of wraps that whole convo in an even worse light 🙈
Yeah the minute I read that about 50 alarms started going off for me. Who the fuck says something like that? There's no context in which it's appropriate to say ""oh just get a couple of plastic surgeries so you can look perfect for me."" That's majorly fucked up.
Thank you 😍

And projecting, as in he was projecting what he wanted to see me as or in me?
no u
I totally agree with you on the matter of him and on the matter of I, and thank you so much 🥰
That's what I thought as well.  He's negging, probably because he wants you to fall for him / want him.  It's a super shitty thing to do to someone.
Yes, this right here.
I will, I do now 🙏
Yeah OP he’s trying to neg you. Piece of shit probably doesn’t even have trans friends.

You know why he said the SRS bit? Because he’s a chaser.
I guess so, yes, it makes sense. Wouldn't be able to verify it though cause I ain't planning on unblocking him or talking to him ever again 👀 oh well, that's life.
It’s cis-splaining
Oh my gosh, thank you for pointing that out. I completely forgot about the “outclassing women” part. That was transphobic as hell. 
She’s a woman.. not some other subspecies of human or some kind of 3rd gender. Like what a creep..
Thank you 🥰 I feel quite happy being me, and I feel a bit angry at myself for letting him destabilize my happiness.
I guess the further I go along the process I'm going to actually encounter it more and more, at least now I have a name for it...
Sometimes I realize a bit too late when I'm facing some or any kind of abuse. I hope to do better in the future.
Thank you so much 🥰 for helping me see him for who he is and for your kind words.
😂 that's how I felt he was trying to position himself 🤣
Periodt
I understand this guy was absolutely an asshole, but what counts as prompted in advice-giving? I think I might be on the spectrum and I’m worried I’ll look like that, to a lesser extent maybe. Do they have to straight up ask for advice?
I understand you might’ve been hurt by someone exhibiting narcissistic tendencies, but please don’t use it as a pejorative. It’s a real diagnosable personality disorder, and it can be treated with therapy!

This guy in the story was an asshole though for sure.
That's actually a great advice and it makes so much sense to me, thank you for sharing 🙏 and also, thank you for your compliment 🥰
PERIODTTTT 👏🏽
That's my worst nightmare - I fall in love with someone (finally) and then after a few years when my appointment finally arrives he'll try to convince me to *not. go. through. with. it* 😰
Thank you so much ❤️🥰
Yeah, they really are! I don't really have a strategy aside from very tactlessly and abruptly changing the conversation. But hey, if you discover something, let me know! XD
Also the chances are that his claim of "" \*\*all\*\* his trans friends really regret doing SRS"" is total BS. [https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/fulltext/2021/03000/regret\_after\_gender\_affirmation\_surgery\_\_a.22.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/fulltext/2021/03000/regret_after_gender_affirmation_surgery__a.22.aspx) This is a pretty good article on trans folk's opinions vis-a-vis regret post op, but you can just read the abstract which makes it pretty clear that of the pooled individuals (almost 8k) less than 1% regret surgery. 

For most people, post op regrets come from realizing later on that they're nonbinary or gender non conforming in some way, not because it's ""unnecessary mutilation"". Hope this helps a bit.
Re-read your second paragraph, but imagine that his sole interest in you is dependant on you having sex with him and not having SRS.
My go to is along the lines of:

“Hmm. You think so? Interesting.” 

It genuinely is interesting to me how clueless some people can be.
It's even shittier still. I told him about my past with men and how I recovered most of my self esteem and confidence. I guess that opened up a door for him to just walk right in 😔
You look great by the way your friend is just so full of it
Keep doing you girl! Have a great holiday weekend ❤️🤍💙
Yeah. It happens quite a bit. People who don’t recognise their privilege tend to speak from that pulpit and never realise they’re doing harm.  But on the plus side, it gets real easy to tune it out after a while. And you always have the community to vent to about it 😘😘😘
I used to be but I’ve had so much of it I fight back now. This is what my daughter taught me, she got expelled from school for fighting with bullying boys at 10
totally, from the heart.
#truth….I can’t tell you enough how truly beautiful I think you are! 😍🥰 We’re too 
hard on ourselves, too critical, too self conscious! If only you could see what I see 
when I look at you!
You did nothing wrong. Hope you can take care of yourself after this horrible conversation, and know that you are valid, your choices are valid, and any medical procedures you decide to do or not do is only up to YOU 💖🏳️‍🌈
Thank you, you too! 💓
I'm so happy I did. I used to always lurk, never comment or post. Now I'm gaining a bit of confidence to connect and reach out 💜

Am I selfish for wanting to be addressed correctly?	"I’ve had a few conversations with my family about being addressed properly and how when i’m not it upsets me ( as in makes me sad) 


and almost every time they say something like “the world doesn’t revolve around you” or “be more understanding” and tell me it’s selfish


I knowww it doesn’t revolve around me and i do understand messing up every once in a while but when it’s consistent it hurts"	"It's not selfish. It's your right. They want to be addressed correctly as well, so why should it be different when it comes to you?
Not selfish at all. It's basic decency. Depending on the family member you can start referring by their proper name. Ie, Mum and Dad become their name. Siblings with shortened names become their full names. Losing those familiar names should help them realise. When they complain offer them a deal, you will address them as they wish, and likewise they do the same.
having spent my whole childhood being told that me asking for basic respect and kindness is the world revolving around me, their demand to continue to treat you like shit is the world revolving around them. you should be called the correct stuff and they can absolutely go fuck themselves.
it's not selfish to want to be treated with respect.
Tell them, “if a 75 year old man can learn to use they/them for his kid after 35 years of she/her, after growing up in catholic school, without making excuses, you can use my real name and pronouns. Do better.” Because that’s my situation. Because he respects my personhood. 

If they don’t at least WORK at it, that says they don’t respect you. 

I did have to tell my dad explicitly that using my pronouns was about respecting me. (He was not a fan of they/them singular at first). After that conversation, he did way better. If my example helps them understand, it’s worth sharing!!
Not at all. How others address you is indicative of how they acknowledge your identity. If they have respect for you, then they should have no problem with addressing you correctly (and only you can decide what that means). They are selfish for not giving you the same respect you give them. It’s absolutely ridiculous for anyone to think of such a basic thing as how someone wants to be addressed as “the world revolving around them”.
a cis guy from my school actually had an argument with me about this a few months ago. he started ranting about how it’s selfish and narcissistic of me and other trans people to want to be called by the correct pronouns. and i just explained to him that “cis gender people expect to be referred to as their preferred pronouns and gender as a given. so by your logic, i should be allowed to call you she because it’s selfish of you to want to be called he by everyone” so then i started talking to my friend about this guy in front of him. and he got really pissed off because i kept calling him she. so then he stood up and walked out of the room. it’s a ridiculous thing for people to say. there is nothing selfish about wanting to be addressed as you want to be addressed.
I hope this isn’t triggering, but this is a good & accurate case if what “grooming” actually is! Society/family teaching you that you’re worth less than you actually are and that you should be complicit with your own abuse by them. 
It’s absolutely not selfish to receive or ask for basic respect and humanity, and they are wrong for saying such. The mindsets of those kinds of people are always projecting their guilt on others: they tell you to be more understanding without them even trying to take their own advice!
I had a co-worker who’s name was Johnny. He was in his 60s. He wasn’t John. It was Johnny. Evidently John was his father and his father was not someone he was fond of. He got frustrated if you tried to call him John. It was never an issue.

Calling someone by their correct name and using their correct pronouns is a sign of basic respect. If someone can’t be bothered to show you basic respect, then they don’t deserve to the gift of your presence.
Short answer : no.
Long answer: noooooooooooooooooooooooo.
They’re gaslighting the fuck out of you.

Implicit in their statement is “my comfort means more than your life”

If *course* you have the right to be addressed properly - *everyone* does.
It's not selfish. It's like if you called them a name they didn't like, or an offensive nickname and you didn't stop after they asked you to. It has nothing to do with thinking ""the world revolves around you"" or whatever. Ugh I'm sorry this even has to be a conversation for you hon. <3
Fun fact: they are the ones being selfish. They're not bothering to do something that would make a big difference for you and it sounds like their logic is that it's just inconvenient for them. So they're choosing a very mild upside for themselves at a significant cost to you.
Am I wrong for wanting to be respected?

When your child comes out as trans, trust me, you won’t forget that. It’s your fucking child.
Yeah, when your the main protagonist of your own life, it kinda does revolve around you. Your not asking them to buy you a house your telling them to have the basic decency to use your freaking name.
Well, yeah, your world revolves around you. So you get to choose who you let into your world. That is not selfish. It's just how life works. When people hurt you, you avoid them. It's what we all do. 67f cis
Absolutely not, if anything, your family are selfish for refusing to address you correctly

I'm in the same predicament so you're not alone ❤️
Really, they are just to stubborn to adjust. You are NOT selfish. They are simply unwilling to adjust to what i'd deem would be your good right to ask for. 

Im sorry you are going through this and I REALLY hope it doesnt Hit you to Hard! Just know that you arent in the wrong here. Asking for basic respect and Treatment is totally okay and your family is just to stubborn. 

Hell, I for one would just Return the favor and purposefully misgender *them* whenever they misgender you, or call them random names instead of their actual ones if they deadname you. If they correct you, just tell them that the World doesnt revolve around them!
Try thinking utilitarian. 

1: it brings you more pain than it prevents.

2: the opposing side is wrong(complex utilitarian concept) and is therefore in need of change.
It’s not selfish! It’s your right.. I personally have just given up knowing my family is never going to address me as my preferred even if I get a legal name change.. so (among other reasons) I’m cutting most of them off or having as little contact as possible
shit like that is so dumb. Its my life, it revolves around me. respect me or don't be a part of it
You are not selfish, I agree on being understanding but they should make an effort if they care about you, right?
it’s pretty baseline in a relationship to not knowingly do things that hurt you
Not selfish, keep fighting. 5years and going here, stay positive my man
No, Bud. You deserve to be called how you are. It's just human dignity at that point. 
If you feel like being petty, you can call your unsupportive family members the opposite of how they identify as, and see how they like it. (if it is safe for you to do so)
oh hell no, you are absolutely not selfish for that! i totally understand it. us trans people struggle so much and it pisses me off to hear cis people complaining to us about how hard it is to use the right pronouns
You are not selfish for wanting to be respected.
It's fucked up what they are doing to you. My only suggestion is to stop responding or speaking to them during misgendering. If they get upset you don't respond remind them that you aren't whoever they were talking to.
Really it depends on context - I would say be patient with them, correct them kindly and don’t take it personally IF they are putting in an effort to try to correct themselves and get used to your new identity. 


If they aren’t trying and are just trying to pass the guilt to you, that sucks. I have no advice other than try to help them understand and then decide what your relationship will be based on that outcome. 

I went through the latter, not related to anything about sexuality though. Guess who only has small talk with their parents on holidays? It sucks but its better than the disrespect and attempts to blame me for things they are responsible for
not selfish at all. start misgendering/misnaming them and see how quick they switch up lol
If they are deadnaming and disrespecting pronouns it’s not selfish for you to ask to be addressed properly. I have a deadname from my childhood and if people use it it causes trauma.
Nope.

This sounds like the sort of asshole family that would blame you for being deathly allergic to cats. Stop hyperventilating, Mr Cuddles deserves to sit on the couch if he wants to. I don’t care you’re actually turning blue. Don’t go outside that’s disrespectful.
Start addressing them incorrectly and say the same thing: “the world doesn’t revolve around you”
It is the exact equivalent of purposely using the wrong name for a person. Start calling them a completely random, somewhat unattractive name every time they do it.
Not at all. Being addressed correctly is basic decency
No- just start using the wrong names for them, and if they get upset say “the world doesn’t revolve around you”
Do it back to them until they get the point.
no youre not selfish
The world doesn't revolve around them either, they are just selfish jerks.
Not selfish
This is considered in many countries to be a violation of your human rights. Which it totally is. My mom pulls the whole ""don't change your name cause that's the name I gave you"" bullshit with me which I'm kinda ok with because I am literally adding three letters and she can deal with it, but it's super frustrating when family seems to take your transness personality. I ended up telling my parents that if they want to be able to have a good relationship with me, they might want to go to a support group for family members of transitioning people or something.
They're gaslighting you plain and simple. They're  claiming that you wanting to be respected and addressed properly is not a big deal and that they shouldn't have to lift a finger emotionally just because ""you've changed"" even though this is just you being true to yourself. They need to get with it and soon,  if they don't understand that this is hurting you now then it's hard to say that they will be willing to put in the effort to adapt to being what family is supposed to be, supportive!
    You're not the selfish one here, they are. If things can't be resolved within a couple frank and open discussions about how this affects you then it may be best to focus on   independence and finding your own family. Everyone needs  love and respect but it's not alway that the ones around you that can provide it. I've found my friends parents and older coworkers to be much more understanding of who I am and respectful, than my birth givers have been. I don't know if your family has religious beliefs but that is the main reason that mine have not come around and all the transphobia they have absorbed in their lives as they are boomers. Self respect may bring some loneliness but it is most certainly better than staying in a codependent  relationship with someone who doesn't meet your needs. I really hope things can be resolved for you but I will say if they can't then just ""do you boo"" and never look back. 💖
It’s not selfish to want to be respected, you deserve to be addressed correctly, it’s basic kindness and respect. I’m so sorry your family is treating you like that.
It’s not selfish at all. Trans people are the only people who know how hurtful it is to not only be addressed incorrectly, but to express that and not be heard. I go through the same thing in my life, I’m sorry it’s happening to you.
My family says that too. It's selfish of them, not you. they refuse to accept you and are trying to invalidate you in ways that make you feel in the wrong. It's manipulative and stupid.
of course its not selfish! cis people wouldnt like being addressed with the wrong pronouns or name either
Not at all. Don’t let anyone make you feel like you don’t deserve the basic respect of being addressed correctly.
That actually leads me to something that's really fun to do with Cisgender people : If they misgender you to often or purposefully, Start doing the same to them.
Transphobes don’t make sense they’ll say you’re overreacting
FR it’s so frustrating, i get it takes time to change but put effort in
My friend’s mom gets my name and pronouns right most of the time and she literally has dementia to the extent of needing a full-time caretaker. There’s no excuse for constantly getting it wrong. Occasional mistakes are one thing, but if they’re not ever getting it right and getting mad when corrected, they’re the ones with the problem.
Hi! I'm new here and am parent to a MtF young woman. I'm very proud of my daughter for a number of reasons, and I joined this sub to learn more about trans issues.

This has come up for us recently; she's just come out in the last couple of months. I'm pretty on-point with her pronouns, but sometimes call her by her birth name. It's not out of lack of respect, but because I've been calling her that name for 20 years. I'm not actively dead-naming her, it's just etched on my brain-more so than her gender ever was. I'm working on it! I want to be the best parent possible.

She's also in a stage (maybe this is common) where she's changed her name every couple of weeks. She's on her third new name in two months. It's very confusing for us, but I know that she is coming to grips with an emerging identity and hasn't landed on a name that feels like ""her"" yet. We support her and love her 100% through this process.

I just wanted to share what the other side of this might look like. Not all of us have the attitude that our children sharing their transformation and new identity is ""selfish""; we're just old with sometimes shitty memories. Thank you for allowing me to share, and if anyone has any suggestions for me, I would appreciate it.
thank you 😭❤️
thank you i appreciate that
thank you 🥲
thank you ❤️
I don’t recommend this— it teaches the cis that it’s okay to misgender someone as a form of retribution or retaliation.
be a pain in the ass if you have to :D  
Btw. works perfectly with bullies how I learned down side is they hate you more
I do this with my brothers lol

[removed]
there comes a point when it's obvious they're not going to put the time or effort in and just want you to quietly drop it and stop standing up for yourself and i fucking hate it
Just keep on doing what you’re doing; we can tell the difference between trying and maliciousness.  You’re a good parent 💕💖💕
That's a fair point...
I think on occasion it makes sense, IF the person in question is likely to take the point. But it does need to be deployed carefully, and specifically only EVER in response to repeated misgendering from the initial offender, as very clear turnabout “see, you don’t like it, so don’t do it to other people”. Not ever for other annoyances.
It's literally a descriptor, dumbass. A red apple is called red because it's red. You're called cis because you're cis.

Why does it seem to be a bad thing? Oh, I dunno, maybe it's because of all the discrimination cishet people tend to do against non-cishet.

App creator who wants to be as inclusive as possible :)	"Hi all, I hope it's ok to post this here, if not i understand if it needs to be removed.

I've launched an app to help people find running partners in their area, and in the profile creation process, we ask users to put their gender. Our current options are:

* Male
* Female
* Trans
* Non-Binary
* Other

I wanted to reach out to the trans community and ask for any feedback or advice or if you read this list and feel included or excluded.

Thanks so much in advance and I hope you're all having great days, wherever you are :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all for the great responses! Consensus seems to be that we should remove trans as it's not actually a gender in and of itself, more an additional descriptor in the same (but apposite) sense as cis. I also love the idea of adding a 'prefer not to say' option :)

&#x200B;

For those of you who asked, the app is called BuddyUp and we launched just a few weeks ago, only on iOS and we're focussing our advertising on London, UK so unless you live in London, you're unlikely to find people nearby you sadly, but IG follows and shoutout are always welcome ;)"	"thanks for posting this only one thing, trans isn’t a gender
I would drop trans, as it is not a gender, just a specifier that correlates assigned gender at Birth with actuall gender.
Other than that, thanks for taking the extra step.
Definitely don’t include trans as a gender as a trans man isn’t a “trans”, he’s a man. Props for asking and checking with people!
I do always find it a bit strange when trans is listed as a separate category like that, like yes I am trans but I am also female, no less so than a cis woman is. Whether someone is trans or cis is kind of just a different question than whether they are male, female, or non-binary.
Please have a ""Prefer not at say"" as well, unless for some reason gender is integral to that app (in which case, rethink that). Lots of questioning people might be uncomfortable having to chose an option. 

And get rid of ""trans"", that's not a gender lol
Most options I've seen that require gender fill in are: male, female, other. Or non-binary/other.
I would remove ""trans"" as an option as it is an identifier of having changed gender or gender presentation at some point in the past, not a gender in itself. Nonbinary is a perfectly treasonable umbrella to use as a ""third option"" that covers a wide variety of fluid and other genderqueer identities. The others I might recommend adding if you want to offer as much representation as possible are ""Agender"" and ""Genderfluid"". (Folks who have no gender, and folks whose gender varies over time).

Thanks for wanting to be inclusive, comrade!
Agreeing with others here, no need for trans as an option, I feel included if forms have a nonbinary/other option. As a runner, this is exactly what I've been hoping for actually, what's the app called?
If you want to be as inclusive as possible, just put a box where people can enter their gender instead of choosing from a list of genders
I would take out trans. Maybe add genderfluid? And definitely the ability to change your gender.
Add that you could change your gender at anytime
I'd say add trans or cis in addition after you check the male or female box

Trans isn’t a unique gender, so don’t make it a unique choice
From the other comments maybe this is just a personal bugbear, I'd replace ""Male"" with ""Man"" and ""Female"" with ""Woman"".

In my mind Male/Female are purely biological categories, ones that you might fit into regardless of your gender, and I worry it reinforces the idea that biology and gender are linked in some way.
My question is why are you making a running app and pairing people by gender. Why not pair people based on preferred running time and endurance, average running speed, intensity, and on the route. Make the functionality so that you can either have a random new partner daily or have a commitment running buddy,
How about:

Male:

•Cisgender

•Transgender

Female:

•Cisgender

•Transgender

Non-Binary

Gender fluid 

Other:

Prefer not to answer.
I would have male, female, trans-male, trans female, non-binary, and prefer not to say.

Then when someone is looking for a running partner ask them wether they would prefer female,male, or either. And then have a checkbox lgbtq friendly.

If someone selects trans female/non binary include them on female/either matches with lgtbq

If someone selects trans male/non binary include them on male/either matches with lgtbq

If someone selects prefer not to say, only include them on either matches.

The reason been, some women would want a female running partner, some may not care, a good example is muslim women etc…

Trans is not a gender, and puts both trans men and women into one category, while they are both opposite genders.
drop the trans, that's not a gender just an adjective, also maybe replace ""Nonbinary"" with ""Other: \_\_\_\_"" so people can specify whatever they want

oh, and if someone types in ""attack helicopter"" block them from making an account/give a message saying ""r/onejoke"" or something similar
Personally, I feel the option of being able to choose ""trans"" as an option for choosing to display one's gender, for those that are gender-fluid or otherwise in their medical/social transition; is valid.

I prefer the ambiguity of using ""trans"", as a short way of stating how I'm a ""person of trans experience"", nothing more, nothing less, as my genitalia doesn't define me and I don't identity or relate to the general consensus in understanding of what the umbrella term ""nonbinary"" is mostly understood to be.

Based on my personal experience interacting on social media/dating apps when given the option to choose how I identify, it misrepresents my identity, I prefer just stating that I am trans, when guven the opportunity to choose gender options, as I am ""trans""-""gendered"". Be it as it may, I suffer with a fluid form of gender dysphoria, I'm still trans.


I feel it should be displayed along the lines of:

Sex: 
•Male
•Intersex
•Female
•Prefer not to disclose (or another option to not have to pick one)

Gender:
•Female (Add option to include ""Trans"" in front of the word Female and male option as well as the word ""Cis"" for those that prefer it in addition of the option not to include it)
•Male (Same ""cis"",trans"", prefer not to include either options as stated above)
•Trans
•Nonbinary 
•Nuetrois
•Adrogyne
•Gender-Fluid
•Gender Nonconforming 

Pronouns:
(option to not include them as well as options to mix them (He/They/Her, etc..)
•He/Him
•She/Her
•They/Them
*far in the back ground* booo ios next you gonna say Linux is better (that is all from the comp sci trans girl)
Wow, I think the comments covered it, but thank you for actualy asking for input.
thanks for asking, ideally I think it should be male, female, non-binary, and prefer not to say :)
How about add a custom button so for some of the genders not listed it can still be shown I don’t know how hard that would be to program
[deleted]
I mean trans isn't a gender, but you could do something like

Cis Male
Trans Male
Cis Female
Trans Female
Non-binary
Gender fluid
Questioning 
Prefer not to say

I think that's a pretty full list
All you really need is 

-male

-female

-non binary 

-prefer not to say
maybe what if you did pronouns instead? she/her they/them he/him?
Hey I know you already got all the answers you probably need regarding this subject, but I want to say thank you, actually! Not a lot of people even consider trans people when making apps, much less try to be inclusive. Your thoughtfulness is really appreciated.
possibly a custom option, with custom pronouns you can write in! for example, he/him/his/himself but people can customize it, as well as an option for multiple pronouns!
for the custom pronouns, it can be used for neopronouns for example , xe/xem/xeirs/xemself !
I would totally drop trans! And rq one thing to add is that you shouldn’t probably add trans or cis as an option because it’s more or less private information! Plus I know a few people who would feel pretty uncomfortable stating their trans-ness to a bunch of strangers outside the community! Just something to consider! Other than that it seems good!
i already see you've gotten on board with the idea of dropping 'trans', i think it would be a cool feature where people could add their pronouns,, gender doesnt always correspond to pronouns, so it may be helpful, as well as adding an option for ""genderfluid"". thanks for checking in with actual trans people for this, we appreciate ally's like you:)<3
Maybe write man and woman instead of male and female. I personally feel a lot more comfortable referring to myself as a man than as a male, and trans is also not a gender.
Make trans optional or leave it out :) so im a trans woman that means id choose the option for female and maybe trans as an optional however i could also put that in my description, what is your app called?
Others have already answered, and I live in the Netherlands so hopefully you expand, but I think a lot of queer people would feel safer excersising in numbers, so an option to select queer running buddies would be great, discourages possible aggressors and queer people are generally safer to excercise with (except for Terf lesbians I guess).
thank you :)
thank you :)
thanks :)
thank you :)
great advise, gonna change to this!
thank you :)
awesome, thank you :) The app is called BuddyUp but 90% of our users are and will for the forseeable future be in London, so if you live elsewhere you won't get much out of it
Difficult to deal with such inputs for filtering by the app.
Yep, that’s an option :)
thank you :)
+1
makes it feel like they're different, if being trans isnt very important to the function of the app just drop the trans entirely (but keep nbonbinary/other)
thank you :)
Haha gotta work out the bugs somehow
we're thinking of going with Male, Female, Non-Binary and Other and there's a slider switch to choose not to show your gender on your profile at all
As a rule of thumb, if you’re unsure about something, so are other people, so you just gotta ask nicely and people are usually cool
Ahh OK, yes I'm a long way from London. Best of luck with the app, I'm sure many will find it valuable
yep, this is exactly the reason, plus it stops transphobic morons from describing themselves as attack helicopters and the like
Also, change name at any time.
Or don't actually, Im wrong, and i just realised that

Gender envy	It makes me sad sometimes when the girls at my school can dress so confidently and openly when I’m stuck being me. I look at girls around my school and get sad that it’s not me wearing that skirt or tank top like they don’t know lucky they are 😭.	"I feel you… hell I’m envious of the other trans girls, cuz I’m not out
Take it from me, a once closeted high school graduate: they're all gonna be checking your IG story all jealous after you bail
me with men:’) it’s so painful and they don’t even know it
Same. I don't think we are alone in this. I would guess it's pretty common ❤❤❤
I felt like this the whole way through school too. It will get better after you leave, especially since secondary school is the time in your life where you feel most judged and pressured. It won’t be like that forever
Got hit by envy today at a supermarket. Girl in a summer dress and denim jacket. Effortless.

Gonna hug my shark and cry.
I feel you. I get very jealous of boys who wear tight t-shirts or tank tops. I wish I had that body type.

Y'know, sometimes I think about dysphoria, and I think that I feel dysphoria not because I don't really like my body, I'm moreless confident about It when I'm inside of my house, but because of what people assume about you when they see your body. If they see boobs, they're gonna assume I'm a woman, or a girl, so I try to hide my chest. At least that's what I personally think about dysphoria
I can relate to this 😭 but at my school i did successfully muster up enough courage to wear a skirt and thigh high socks to school, but after wearing them for 3 school days a person called my mom and long story short, we argued and by that i mean she just yelled at me and i didnt know how to respond however me and her and my sister all hugged after(sister wasnt in the arguement bc learning this information about me is to traumatic) and i was sobbing so much and i havent worn a skirt since(except at a friends house) also i will not talk about my dad in this comment 😒
I also feel like that and its even increased now that all of my classmates are going to have quinceañeras
I feel you so much, and I work myself over it that i am jealous of my friends and gf (she's fine with me being mtf, sees me as a girl). I just can't say anything but that I fully understand you, i wish i could give u a hug rn to make try to make u feel better
Its all steps...big ones and little ones. The first, and  biggest, is SELF ACCEPTANCE. How can anyone accept you if you don't accept yourself.
Yeah. I get gender envy from even the small children whos parents bring them into my work. I'm always thinking ""damn I wish I could wear a cute colorful dress rn""
😭😢😥
Oh, I get this so, so much.

I‘m pretty much a shut-in as regards social interaction for this very reason.

I did buy stuff to wear, quite a lot of it, but when Insaw myself, I didn’t get this sudden rush of feel-good, instead, I felt dejected and despondent because I just looked like a pathetic, mockable and ridiculous’man-in-a-dress’. 

Maybe it’s just me, but if I can avoid mirrors and seeing myself, it becomes easier. And this is after 2 years and 4 months (nearly), of HRT.

Something went so wrong for me, just like every single other thing in life.
Me too. Its an internal struggle. Also dosnt help that one of my friends came out recently. (Congrats to her) but it hurts for me cause I don’t have the confidence too :(
Or trans girls who pass, whenever I get feminine time I still just look and feel like a man in a dress.
<3
Bro I’m so sorry. It’s so rough for us
It’s just so unfair. I wish they knew how lucky they are.
Well I’m glad about that. Also when I graduate secondary school I’m probably gonna come out as well.
One day I hope to look like that. But the voice in the back of my head keeps telling me that I never will.
That sucks bro. I’ve been feeling dysphoria for a long time now and only recently have I been able to put a name to it. Take a virtual hug until things get better 🫂
I had this huge replay written out and I clicked off by accident and deleted it! 😭 what I said though was that you don’t owe anything to anybody. Dressing the way you want and being the person you want to be dosnt require permission. It dosnt mean much but all of us are here for you sister. I’m sorry.
That was rough for me too. And at the time my egg hadn’t broke yet so I was extra confused as to why I was jealous.
Thank you. I really appreciate it. I guess this is just what’s going to happen for a while. But everyone here on Reddit definitely makes it better!
I’ve always been envying other genders even before I knew I was a girl. I was like, man….. I wish I had hair like that…
I’m so sorry to hear that. I guess we are all in this boat together. Have a virtual hug friend. <3 it’s not the real thing but I hope on a very small way it helps you.
Could you come out to just them? They might be a safer person, and would give you a good place for support if you trust them.

I'd still make sure you trust them and not just come out because they're also trans. People are still people.
it really is:’)
Ikr
That voice is a dumb little poopoo-headed bitch, kick its ass and prove it wrong
Thank you i will keep that in mind also… thank you again •v•
Just when u see a pretty girl and u get jealous think this: you can be that some day, you can be a pretty girl being all confident some day. That helps me sometimes
I’ve come out to her yeah, and a couple of very very very close friends. All of whom are super understanding and accepting. However they don’t really get it. My trans friend does but she dosnt text much so my outlet is here on Reddit. With all of you wonderful people!
Deal
That helps me too. That reality just seems so far away and out of reach. :(
That's true, the goal is hard to reach, but not impossible! And i know you can be that pretty girl some day who others will be jealous of, just don't give up ans let negative thoughts get to u!
Thank you. Really thank you. This is one of the first steps in a long journey. You are making that journey easier for me. Thank you. <3
You are so welcome, i want to support and help other trans people on their journey! 

(Lol even tho I'm not done with my journey)
We all help each other and together we will make the world a better place! Good luck on your journey!
Tysm and u too! 😘

I made a mistake and looked through my sisters Facebook. Trigger warning:Transphobia	"So I occasionally look through my estranged sisters Facebook to see how she’s doing and to see what’s happening with her and niece’s and nephew. This is regularly a mistake her profile often has a fair few transphobic post which I usually just try to ignore to the best of my ability. However there was one post that just hurt and irritated to the extent that I had to rant about it somewhere. 


So the content of the post was fairly standard for transphobic bullshit, some crap about trans women not being women and how trans women shouldn’t be allowed in sports, standard fucking bullshit. What really upset me was the fact it was a meme and they purposely used a format that is specifically used by trans communities (I’ve only found it called “trans girl gets sad”). Just seeing these fucking people take something that has become a staple in the community and perverting it into this hateful bigoted crap just made my blood boil, and I don’t see any bloody way that it wasn’t one hundred percent intentional and done just to specifically upset and hurt trans people."	"that’s awful and i’m sorry you had to go through that
Cut. Them. Out. Blood doesn't mean shit. Cutting my toxic family out of my life literally saved me from suicide.
while i dont believe trans girl gets sad is a trans specific thing i do believe its best for you to like stop looking at her posts
Sorry about that :/ I get the sports argument especially in contact or combat sports but still what’s the point in posting about it ALL the time
Facebook is bigot haven. Cut it and them out
It is what it is, I don’t have much contact with her outside of dropping off Christmas presents for my nieces and nephew. Although I do wish we could have a better relationship although I think that possibility is most likely going to go out the window the second I start transitioning.
Very true but I kinda get the vibe op is trying to cut her out since estranged and only recently checks the FB. 
It's hard to let go of someone you've known like a sibling regardless of how much they may suck :(
There’s not much to cut out, we only met for the first time in our adult lives like 4 years ago and collectively I’ve seen her about 4 times, mostly just dropping off presents for the kids to make sure they have a happy Christmas"	uk1req	trans	326	0.98	2022-05-07 00:51:00
I am in tears over knowing I can never be trans	"Sorry if this isn't allowed I just want to vent so for the longest time I haven't been happy with who I am as a male. I've always wanted to transition sadly I know that I can't so I've had to resort to kind of catfishing (not like dating anyone just pretending to be a girl online) and using female video game characters in order to atleast feel somewhat happy. However when I'm not online or playing video games I'm stuck knowing I can never fully feel my true self and its absolutely heartbreaking.

The 2 main reasons I can't transition is:

I would not be able to recreate the girl I have created in my head as I'm just not at all attractive even as a guy and I know I wouldn't be happy with how it turned out

My entire family are insanely far right and even if I would try it I'm almost 100% certain they would disown me and they all mean the world to me and I love them and couldn't bare the thought of my actions being the reason I lose them 


I'm at a lost and I don't know what to do I hate this feeling of not being complete but I know its impossible does anyone have any tips?"	"First of all, I'm sorry your family is unaccepting of such issues. But i also want to point out that not transitioning doesn't mean that  you aren't trans. You are the gender you are. Your physical appearance doesn't change that. If you are happier as a girl, if you feel that you are a girl, then you are.
It doesn't matter what other people think, gender is personal. 
Now I also understand your feeling of not living up to the image you have in your mind. I understand the feeling of not feeling attractive. (As a man or woman, it doesn't matter) you probably think that there's nothing you can do, that you have no control. But that's not true. First of all, start believing in yourself. Don't let you or other people put you down. We always think about our negative traits first, but we all have good traits. For instance, i really hate my nose, but i also know that my eyes have this really cool shade. 
Also, appearance isn't all that matters. You probably have other interesting traits about you. Maybe you know alot about a certain subject, maybe you're funny, maybe you have a nice smile. I'm sure if I asked your family for instance, they'd say a lot of nice things about you.

TLDR: you are awesome, physical appearance isn't all that matters. Now go believe in yourself :D
I wish I owned a fucking trans orphanage to take these people in my heart fucking dies for you all. 

Maybe someday you will be able to come out and maybe someday you’ll realize that girl you made up in your head is maybe not realistic and that being your true self will still make you happy. 

This is coming from a trans girl who is fully out, doesn’t pass, but literally is turning people away daily who are trying to date/be with me. 

Honestly a lot of it has to do with my personality and confidence which I absolutely did NOT always have!!!!! Be you sister ❤️

Dm me if you ever wanna talk
All I can feel is how much you must be hurting and I wished I were there to hold you and keep you safe.  That said I am not and for that I am sorry.

Can you remember, there are people here who don't see you and live in your home that still love you and care for you.  That if they could would do anything to make your life the life you dream of.  You are amazing and perfect in the way you are and anyone who doesn't agree doesn't have it all together like you do.  You feel your pain because of who you are, you will succeed in being the best you are because you can.

Come here and feel safe, be who you are and be happy as you can for now, and you will be that caterpillar that becomes the butterfly, soon.  Just stay safe for now.

I know I only speak for my self but I love you and I am sure others will feel the same way.
Niether of those reasons should stop you from transitioning. If your family doesn't like you, get a new family. If you think you can't recreate the girl in your mind, what is the harm in trying?
I’m sorry, but these are horrible reasons. You need to focus on your independence. Once you can free yourself from your family and make a living on your own, then you’ll be able to freely transition in safety.

Don’t give up. Plan for the future and try to set goals that are achievable and also to reward yourself when you achieve these goals. Depending on how old you are, you should be getting your own health insurance. Once you do that, you can plan a time to start hormones. Do the research and proceed with caution. Keep the timing close to when you can live on your own.

People seldom live up to the ideal people they see in their heads so don’t beat yourself up over it. Do your best and try to find happiness and contentment with your body along the way.

You can do it. You just need to escape your comfort zone. Always plan and back up plan in order to make your journey as smooth as possible.
You are definitely trans. You might not be able to transition, whether it's from choice or some other reason, but being trans is your identity. If you identify with it, then it's you.
That's how it kinda started for me the best advice I can really give you hun is to abe honest with yourself when your ready to move out start slowly transitioning and slowly making it known start being the woman you always wanted to be and if they can't accept you other will
You don't have to ""fully transition"" to be trans. You don't even have to do anything, besides be a different gender than what was assigned to you. You don't even have to present as that gender or tell anyone (and if you did you're already doing that online). In the past and also still in some circles it was common believe that you aren't trans until you 'get the surgery', but that is outdated and untrue. It sucks that there are things stopping you from pressuring the transition you want, but even that can't stop you from being trans.
May I add a point? Apart from the family stuff
Which gap is larger? The one between the image in your head and your ""male to others"" image? Or one between the image in your head and an opening and unfolding image of your female identity? First, maybe you don't reach what you dream about, but: you can find many other surprises along the way And: hey, having a gap with a virtual identity could happen in different ways to all of us. I mean, there are also cis women who have an unreachable ideal in virtuality. But second, if you reach ground with SOME of the energy you are putting in your virtual identity,I think you'll enjoy it more and more, in unexpected ways.
💜
If they don't love you for who you are, they don't deserve to be in your life.

Lots of people wish they were more attractive, but what about happier? You might not become the most beautiful girl, but you can be a girl. That's worth a lot.
First of all, if you want to be trans, you already are. You don't need to medically transition, or even pass as female in order to be a trans woman. There are plenty of others like you, in situations where fully transitioning isn't an option, and that doesn't make any of them any less valid. 

I've had those negative feelings about my own appearance too. But the closer I've come to looking the way that I want to, the more I've realized that hyper fixating on this idealized image of myself only really causes more unnecessary pain. Part of this is the fault of unachievable beauty standards that permeate so much of modern day society and media. Most of us probably aren't going to look like supermodels, or game characters, or anime catgirls, or whatever idealized image we want to see ourselves as, but we can try. The important thing is holding an image of yourself that you're comfortable with. 

Lastly, if your family won't accept your true self, that would be their choice, not yours. If they're willing to put their bigotry ahead of accepting their own daughter's identity for the sake of her happiness, then you aren't at fault. You're the one being victimized here, and you cannot blame yourself for it.
I don't mean to be rude or inconsiderate, but the way I see it, if your family can't love you for who you are on the inside, they don't deserve your love in return. I know for many people family is the most important thing in life, but if your family can't love you for who you truly are, they aren't your true family.

I am an introvert and a shut in with social anxiety, so for the longest time the only people I had in my life were my biological family. But when I realized they didn't accept me for who I am on the inside, I had to make the choice to cut them off. It hurts, but not as much as it hurt to suppress who I truly was. I tried to talk to them about it, but they refuse to believe me, so I had to make the choices that were best for me.

Once you have the option to be independent, take it. Be who you are, and don't let anyone take that from you.
I'm sorry for your family, but even the most unlikely ones can accept you once you reveal your true self. Really, there ARE good surprises, and you just won't know until you do it. Just wait until you're 100% safe and independent.

I had this fear at never being able to become the girl I want to be, but as months go by, i find that I am happy with who I'm becoming, even if I know I'll never be the kind of girl I wanted to be. Too tall, too clumsy...

One advice : do what makes you feel the happiest. If you feel happier while imagining yourself as a woman, or playing games as a woman, just give presenting yourself as a woman a try ! For that, trans subreddits are the perfect place to get all the affirmation, support and validation you need. 

And don't be afraid about being possibly ugly. All the trans girls i know just had a massive glow up, and after two years, some even looked better than their genderbent faceApp picture. Really, feeling at home in our body is a major thing in being and feeling attractive.

Whatever you decide to do, remember this choice is not definitive, you can go back, come back, you can hesitate, you can try, try again, and again, you're totally valid. It's your life, and only YOU get to chose what's best for you.
I know it's hard to hear, but if your family doesn't accept you, they're definitely not worth it. 
It's your life and you only have one, so go and live it!
Well you ARE trans.  You are afraid to transition for not unreasonable reasons but that doesn't invalidate your womanhood.

I'm coming out real soon and I doubt I'll ever look like the woman I wish I could....but guess what?  Tons of cis women aren't happy with their looks either.  Being a woman is about much more than being conventionally ""pretty"".  I felt that way for a long time.  At 40 now I have realized and come to accept that living as a man for the second half of my life sounds a lot worse to me than failing to look like a pin up girl.

As for your family.  That's tough.  You love them. They love you.  But guess what?  They don't even know the real you. You're gonna live your whole life in misery just to keep their fragile conservative feelings intact?  Doesn't your happiness matter?  

This journey is HARD. For all of us in our own ways.  I'm on the brink of telling my wife and mother of our 2 kids that ""hey so I'm a woman and I cannot possibly be a man for you anymore"".  I'm facing a 50/50 chance of divorce with her possibly moving back home from LA to the east coast and taking the kids who are my entire world.  But as my therapist pointed out, I need to live for me not just them and it's probably not ideal for my kids to have a depressed dad around.  It's better ultimately for them to have an happy ""dad"" even if that means their dad is a woman.  

Point is.....you ARE trans and you CAN transition if you work for it.  It's never easy, for any of us.  Girl, I believe in you!

My heart breaks for you hun.  I truly hope you find your path and allow yourself to be ... yourself.  

I should add that transitioning is not required of anyone to be trans!

~hugs~ 💕💕
You are who you are, forever and always, even if your family rejects it. Found family is a big deal, and you’re not bound by your biological family forever. Even if you decide not to do HRT or surgery, that’s not the only piece to transitioning. You find what’s right for you and your position and who you want to be, whatever that means for you. You know yourself best. And you will forge new family, new relationships. The trans community is a vast and wide one, and we welcome with open arms. 

A tip I have for you is experimenting, where you’re comfortable and safe. Try on that outfit you thought you couldn’t pull off. Try on makeup, grow your hair out, whatever. If it doesn’t work out, try something else! Don’t be discouraged. There is nothing wrong with trying and not liking it, it just means you haven’t found the right thing for yourself yet. Try using different pronouns online, see what gives you euphoria or, if you don’t like it, you can change it up again. There are endless combinations and there’s no “right” way to be trans - if you’re trans, you’re trans. And if you’re not, that’s okay too! Everyone should experiment and look inside themselves. Find a sense of community, either in person or online. Make other LGBT friends and talk with them just about their experiences and maybe find something you resonate with. 

When I started, I thought the same thing. That I could never be the man I was meant to be, that I would be trapped. But as I get older and further along into my transition and expand my circles both on and offline, you’ll find a rainbow of people, some with similarities and some with differences to yourself that you can learn and draw from. You keep chugging until you find what’s right for you, and you alone. You don’t owe anyone anything at the expense of your happiness and true self. Remember that you will have time, you will have fresh experiences, and you will find yourself, and always be discovering. 

It’s your life, no one else’s. 

Do what makes you happy. Do what feels authentic and real and makes you love yourself and the world in its vastness. It’s hard. But a rewarding journey.
I see other people who are going to be saying things a lot better than I. But I know this: your family doesn't matter, it's YOUR life. You want to transition, transition. And you don't have to worry about looks, either. You don't even have to transition. Being trans doesn't mean you HAVE to transition. It just means you can be who you want to be.
Your mental health will constantly be under attack until you get out from the oppression in your house.

You don't need to pass, you just need to be happy. You'll love yourself a month in, 2 months in, and so on. 

There is no ""can't be trans"", only ""I'm going to suffer until I break"". You can put it on the back burner but this will always come bubbling back.

If your family won't respect the you, you want to be - maybe they're not really that great to begin with?
I can absolutely empathize with your feeling discouraged by the fear that you won’t become the woman you want to be. For the longest time, I never even considered being trans as an option for that same reason.

When I tore off the band-aid and started transitioning, I was amazed at how my focus changed from reaching my perceived end goal to the euphoria I got from embracing my femininity. I don’t see the woman I wish I was in the mirror — not yet, anyway. But every time I make a baby step closer in this very long process, the great feeling it gives me is continued validation that I made the right choice.

Transitioning is scary; coming out is terrifying. However, I would argue that making decisions out of fear will always end with a result you’re unhappy with. When thinking about whether you want to embrace this part of you, remember that the worst-case scenarios you imagine are not a certainty. There is always just as much hope that things will play out better than you expected.

Finally, while I don’t know your family, it sounds like you currently have a very good relationship with them. That’s great! While coming out to those close to you is a scary thing, I urge you to not take away your family’s opportunity to love you for who you are. While they may be right-wing, and while their initial reactions may be of confusion or fear, by keeping your true self from them, you’re making a decision for them regarding whether or not they will accept you. It’s remarkable how people can adjust their views when an issue becomes directly relevant to those they love.

Know that you are a beautiful person, and that you deserve love — from others, and from yourself. Follow what your heart says you need to be happy, whichever way you decide.
Hey it’s ok. Can i tell you something. I started off as crossdressing didn’t think if it much. Only recently did I come to terms to it. I’m pretty sure my family will be ok with it if I told them but I’m transitioning in private. I’ve been online dating and in the bio section explain my situation. Some guys are ok and would be part of my transition too. Don’t sweat it you’ll figure it out. I was there where you are. You only get braver and it comes naturally after that.
I know it's hard, but if you want to be trans, you're trans.
Like, right now you are trans. Trust me when I say appearance changes a TON on HRT, and I know it doesn't mean much from a random on reddit but your family doesn't deserve you making yourself miserable. Regardless of how much you care about them, you should always be your main priority.
This was my experience for a long, long time. Even without the family issues, I just knew I'd never be *seen* as a woman. But eventually it got so bad and I resorted to doing things I shouldn't have done just to feel a tiny bit of that femininity. 

Once i realized I would rather transition and feel like a woman, even if no one saw me as a woman, rather than be miserable the rest of my life as a man, I said screw it.

I'm not saying it's easy, not at all actually. Knowing you'll never pass and seeing the immediate look in people's eyes that recognize you're different is fucking devestating, and that's something many trans women have to deal with even after hormones because of the effects of male puberty and our masculine features. 

BUT, for me, it's better than keeping the mask I've been wearing for almost all my life. I've accepted the cost that I'll never pass, yet it's still worth it because inside I feel happy.

That's something you need to decide for yourself, if feeling your true self is worth it in the end.
I'm worried too about my looks... I always feel I'm not attractive enough... But there are friends who support me... I'm worried about transitioning because I don't know how I might end up... I'm about to start my tests before HRT... I have my parents to support me... But they are getting old... My brother lives in California... He's too far away... I'm under a lot of stress...
(((((((( hug 🤗))))))) I have 39 years with a similar situation! I have now reached a point where I MUST BE ME! You will too!♥️
You can totally transition. 
1) being an ugly girl is better than being any boy
2) you’ll become waaaay hotter than you think that you can be. 

I was resigned to being a pretty ugly girl, but then as I transitioned all the pain of dysphoria stopped holding me down and it became way easier to do everything. Eat healthy. Work out. All the good stuff. Good luck!! The first year or so is brutal but it’s pretty dope after that.
I don't fully know your situation but transitioning is still the best way to combat your feelings. Like other people said, the only thing you need to be trans is to feel and desire to be a gender other than what you are assigned at birth. 

It can be really difficult to get to where you want to be in your transition. It takes bravery and a hell of a lot of patience, however if you begin transitioning it gets easier! Starting with little things and working your way up to it will let you feel more like yourself and become more willing to be patient in becoming your most beautiful self! Eventually this process will let you also come to terms with the limitations of your transition. Either way, it's best to do what makes you feel like yourself!

As far as family goes, that obviously really tough. However you have a huge community here with thousands of experiences similar to you that can give you support and advice. Depending on your age and financial independence, it might be best to distance yourself from your family so you can transition more safely. If you love your family and they love you, that relationship can survive (it will not be easy by any means). If they will never learn to accept you, then it might be a time to question whether that relationship is worth all that pain. 

All in all, follow your heart, be brave, be yourself, and we all believe in you! I wish you the best!
I thought the same way my mum an dad were my world but I decided that I would disown them in fact I'm coming out and saying fuck you to both of them next week
Its already been said, but transitioning doesn't make you trans. Being transgender means you do not identify with your assigned gender. You don't need to medically transition to be trans and trying to lie to yourself or convince yourself elsewise can't change that. A lot of us have to deal with far right or ""old fashioned"" families who cannot find it in their hearts to support someone they claim to love. Just because someone has some twisted idea of gender or identity, does not mean you aren't who you know yourself to be. If you honestly feel such distain for your birth sex, and such euphoric joy from expressing yourself femininely, I think its pretty clear what the truth is. Our journeys are rarely easy, but its one so many of us take. Whether that journey leads to transition, or just exploration, I hope you come to find that its your journey to go on, and no one can stop you from finding the beautiful parts of yourself that you can love <3
This might be long but I had a very similar mindset. I also had some perfect vision of a girl that I wanted to look like and I would look at different trans timelines and wish that I could have something similar happen to me someday. Yet when looking in a mirror I always would look at myself and think that the woman in my head would be unattainable so I kinda gave up on attempting to transition for a good chunk of my life. Also on your other point I get were your coming from my family is very important to me and for quite alot of my life I didn't want to ruin my relationship with them to transition. My parents are super right wing and Christian and I know are openly against people transitioning, they see it as that person being selfish and just doing what they want without regard for people around them. That mindset for the longest time also discouraged me from transitioning as I didn't want to be someone who was being selfish and put themselves before those around them. Time passed and the feelings never left but I just tried to ignore them because I didn't want disappoint anyone and because I thought I'd just be ugly If i did. But overtime it wore on me and I realized I couldn't just keep representing myself in order for to keep a few people around me happy. And so I came out, not publicly but to myself and a few friends. For awhile I still had a hard time thinking I'd ever look like the girl I wanted to be. Eventually I got on hrt and after a few months I hit the ""I see her in the mirror""phase and it was nice but I still thought I'd never look like I'd imagined. Now however when I look in the mirror I'd don't she ""her"" but me just the girl I've always been. So I'm not saying ur feelings are invalid or wrong or that I am able to understand your circumstances. I just wanted to share that I've been in a similar place and that it wasn't healthy for me to be there and that I feel so much better now. I love my parents but their hate for trans people and their opinions on transitioning and the emotional manipulation they use to want me to feel bad is just wrong I don't think that people should have to sacrifice their lives just to make a few jerks happy. This probably wasn't helpful but idk its hear if you want to read whatever you decide I hope in the end that it's a decision that makes you happy and that you have a wonderful life.

Btw the way feel free to start a chat with me if you want to talk about anything I want to help people in anyway that I can.

I'm transmasc but I can never transition. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.
I learned something just tonight...So I'm 6 months into transition, checking the mirror each day for the changes... Thinking ""do I look like a woman yet?""

But transition not about looking like a woman, it's about looking like yourself... And if that person is a woman, your appearance will show that. If you put the effort in.. I never EVER dreamed I could look anything like I do now. I'm not especially attractive or anything, I don't think... But I'm HAPPY! and ppl see that and are attracted to that positivity & authenticity. 

I know where you're at though... I thought the same way for 15 years, till the end of 2020 I said fuck it, why not? What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And if someone wanna disown you for being this way, you don't need that In your life if you plan to grow & develop as a human... A feminine one too 😉. 

You owe it to yourself to just try it.
this is legitimately exactly how i feel, i just could never put it into words as powerfully as you did...
Sometimes the longer we think about transitioning the more we grow up in between and our ideals grow up. We expect less of the anime French maid deal and start to see ourselves for our femininity or masculinity and how it fits together.

Everyone transitioning with unrealistic expectations should remember that a part of them may feel like a child because we never truly went through puberty, and in that sense we desire the same overly wishful things we would have wanted as kids born the right gender imagining ourselves after puberty.
These people have great points, everyone here believes in you. Distance yourself from your family if you can, or try and get them to understand. Sorry if that seemed offensive, but im just trying my best, and i also don't know your living situation.
I used to think it'd never be enough, that I'd never be happy with my face or how I looked. I was wrong. I felt beautiful all day today, and I haven't even been on hormones that long. (I did shell out a bit for facial electrolysis though...)

I've been through it- the worst my far-right, manipulative AF community could throw at me. I never talk to my parents because they're deliberately hurtful and transphobic. I'm pretty much dead to them. You know what? I fucjing don't care! I'm actually happy for the first time in literal years!! I have a new family of people who actually value, respect, and know me! It was so freaking worth every bit of uncertainty and growing pains.

Hope that helps? You're so young- and you have no idea what's possible, ducky. 💙🤍💖 I promise it gets better. It gets better.
Many people have probably said what I'm about to say but: I'm sorry to hear about your family, and you do need to weigh whats more important to you, but please don't actively harm yourself for others, it never is a good thing in the long run :(

Secondly: transitioning is not about being attractive. Transitioning is about being who you truly are. You do not need to be an attractive, sexualized person. Thats NOT what being trans, or even being female, is. Please don't equate femininity with being sexualised or being attractive, because then you're setting unrealistic goals for yourself. (Unrealistic as in femininity =/= sexualized/attractive. Not you being apparently unattractive.) Not to mention many females dislike being sexualized since they find it degrading. 

Being trans, and transitioning are two different things :3. I hope one day you are able to transition, but you will always be trans!
Just straight up, no bullshit 1) that means you are trans 2) not doing anything about it is going to make life painful to the point of not being worth living 3) hormones are fucking magic and you're probably more attractive than you think anyway and 4) anyone who would prefer to not have you at all rather than see you be happy and not pretending to be a dude is not someone you need to give a shit about  


The best advice I've ever given is to be selfish, to demand happiness, and to destroy anyone who gets in your way. You are not lesser, you deserve more, and you should take it. Be who you want to be, the person that makes you happy, and fuck anyone who doesn't want that for you, because if they loved you they wouldn't want anything less
Am so sorry my dear! Am really so sorry you are going through this😭
You are literally already trans.  

You don't have to transition to be trans.

We love you.  You are loved.  

Maybe wait it out and move somewhere with an established trans community.

And again, and I can't stress this enough, we love you.    

You are beautiful.  
Not everyone fits the same mold.  
But you're beautiful. 
And loved.
It is not the dress, the outfit or how you appear that makes you who you are it is your mindset. 

What you feel, what you like, what makes you happy is who you are and this... No one can take that away from you.

Of course it is hard, of course a lot of people around won't understand, but when you know who you are, the whole world could tell you the opposite you would still stand for yourself.

If we start to behave with ourselves like those who oppress us how are we better?
Do not give up I believe in you you can do it, I know you will find a way to achieve it never is too late for start
I understand this feeling all too well. I like the way I look in girl mode (even if it isn't what I always fantasized about), but I'm just not ready to come out to anyone other than my partner. I don't want to burn familial bridges.
I can related with all of this! :,D
Thank you ❤ and I know appearance isn't everything I'm just kind of a perfectionist and I've envisioned her in my head for so long that it's almost just the normal look now that I would associate with me being a girl
A trans orphanage would be amazing hopefully one day it will become more acceptable 

And yeah I don't have a lot of confidence in myself probably because I don't love my current self
>I wish I owned a fucking trans orphanage

Depending on your level of seriousness, you could always try to reach out to the Tenacious Unicorn Ranch in Colorado to see how they navigated the formation of their community.

Thank you that is actually one of the nicest things anyone has ever told me ❤
But the thing is I do love my family and I don't want to lose them even though I probably won't be happy 

And I don't want to fully transition and then still hate myself because I cant be this thing I've created in my head for so long
Then I guess I'm trans 😁
I don't really know many other people and my family has really been the only thing I've ever had I really couldn't imagine life without them good or bad
Thanks I'm not really familiar with how it all works tbh never really looked into it because I thought it was impossible for me
Idk if I'd even get close tbh I've used filters and such and I turn out hideous each time 😂 which I know in the long run happiness > attractiveness but I mean being cute helps a little
I'm just scared I wont even look anything like a girl attractive or not and just look like a bad Halloween costume or something
Thank you ❤ I've tried those filters that show what you look like as a girl and just didnt like what I saw but ig you are right but idk I think my ideal look is achievable just not by me 


And a side note when you called me their daughter that made me really happy thank you I've never seen anyone say that
Thank you!! I never really understood the whole validation thing and why trans people always made a big deal about it but there are comments on this very post calling me girl related names and it genuinely made me so happy to see it ❤
The problem is I don't know really anyone near me who is trans so I would most definitely be alone unless I were to move but in that case I wouldn't even know where to move to

But I do 100% believe I am trans I started thinking something was a little suspicious when a few days ago some guy called me princess as an insult and instead of being mad I enjoyed it quite a lot 😂 so today i put she/her pronouns on Twitter as kind of a way to further prove even though I feel like I already know the truth
I already get euphoria from feminine type things so I know I would be overwhelming happy with being fully a woman and I want that more than anything but I've seen how my family reacts towards other trans people in our family and its nothing short of horrible
Thank you I might try that aswell as I think it's the safest option at the moment
I know I just love them so much and I don't want to be the reason they're disappointed especially my grandma who is in horrible health
Yeah you're right that is one of my biggest fears if I do decide to transition but I think I would rather be happy
I'm glad you have people who support you your parents would most definitely want to see their daughter being the girl she was always meant to be you should read some of the comments other people have left they have helped me tremendously ❤
Awe I'm so happy for you I believe that point is coming sooner rather than later for me I'm just very scared about it is all ❤
So like I hope this doesnt sound creepy but I was looking at your profile and you are insanely beautiful 

And yeah I never really looked at it like that I am really miserable currently and don't really feel like I belong but It just seems like ""pretty"" trans girls get treated better by society then non pretty trans girls and idk that scares me
Thank you I'm just not sure if I'm brave enough for something like this because I know I'd probably hurt a lot of people
Congrats!! Hopefully I can be there one day I hope it all works out for you ❤
Thank you ❤ I've never actually thought it fully before but this whole comment section has made me realize I'm a trans woman It oddly feels very relieving to say those words idk why
I had to google transmasc cuz I'm kinda dumb 😂 but I'm very sorry you have to go through it aswell it I hope one day you get to be your true self
Thank you you are very pretty btw and I do want to be happy more than anything I just don't know if its possible for someone like me
I'm glad I'm not alone 😊 I've had all of this built up inside for awhile now it's good to finally have a place to write it all out
From what I've seen society treats pretty trans girls better and I don't even need to be like smoking hot just cute is all I really want tbh but yeah I get what you are saying ❤
It's not offensive and yeah it's just so hard because I do still love them all
I hope it does I would love to try hormones one day just not entirely sure on how to get it or what it even does
Yeah I get that I just want to be cute not really like a sex object but just so that like I can wear cute clothes and like go out in public and not be immediately bullied for being myself but idk if any of that actually makes sense I'm still kind of new to all of this
Honestly I'm already at the point where this boy life isnt worth living I absolutely can't stomach it but my sister is literally my entire life she has a mental illness and I always think it's my place to make sure she is safe and I'd feel horrible putting myself over her
Thank you the love this community has shown has really helped ❤
Thank you so much I'm so happy the girl that's been suppressed for so long finally has a safe space to come out I love you too ❤
Thank you I've been talking with people who are helping me start it soon ❤
What do you do when you are around other people? I'm getting a house soonish hopefully and I want to start maybe drag but idk how far I should go
I like to think of the expression: ""if something is worth doing, it's worth doing poorly"". 

Now, that doesn't mean to do everything bad, it means that if doing something brings you happiness/fulfills you, doing that thing even a little bit, or not perfectly is fine. It will still bring you a bit of happiness or fulfillment.

I'm also a perfectionist. I love to compose electronic music, however i always tend to not finish songs because they aren't perfect (if perfection exists anyways). However, I realized that just finishing them, brings me alot of fun and joy, because now I can play them on my phone, speakers, etc... I get to appreciate the work i put into it.

I try to think about other aspects of my life the same way. Not a perfect burrito? That's fine,I can still eat and enjoy it! I didn't perfectly paint my nails? that's ok, they still look kinda pretty! My body isn't how I want it to be? That's ok, I can work on it over time, i can try to accept it over time.

I doubt a single trans person looks exactly how they imagined themselves. We all have unique bodies. We all have unrealistic expectations. As humans we love to imagine things, we like beautiful things. But we all aren't perfect and that's fine. It's what makes us diverse and special. Don't focus on your ideal. Take it one step at a time (if you decide to transition)
 
TLDR; You are awesome 😎 and unique. Perfection isn't everything
But none of us are what we imagine in our head. We are just ourselves. Mourn the imagination and embrace the real you as the girl you are supposed to be.
With all these comments I’m sure you know now, how much some of us relate to this. 
Your family situation is so so awful and I hope that some day you’re in a place of independence from them, if they are unable to accept you. 
As for feeling like you don’t look the way you want, most of us feel that way at some point. But remember the most goodlooking person in the world won’t be as attractive as the most confident and happy person in the world. Nourishing who you are on the inside has surprising effects on the outside parts& how we feel about them. You deserve a free and happy future
I was fortunate to have come out at a place where I was receiving counseling and therapy for addiction and first found out how to love myself and then shortly after I came out, it has been a fucking rock star experience so far and I’m unbelievably grateful
They were recently featured on Samantha Bee and it was amazing how badass they are.
then you haven't been noticed by those who love you yet.. don't have to be super visible just be there and keep communication lines open, there are going to be assholes, but you will be fine as long as you remember YOU are Worth IT!
Sounds like you need to take some time to mourn the delusional hypothetical you created and come up with a more realistic goal. Not everything that’s functional is beautiful and not everything that’s beautiful is functional. Functionality is way more useful than beauty so try to focus on finding something that works, and worry less about whether it’s considered beautiful or not. Beauty isn’t as important as being functional.
It is 100% your choice. But holding this back never really goes well. I wish you luck.
[removed]
But are you your family are you every individual one of them are you going to let them keep you back from expressing who you are on the inside if so that is not good don't let fear keep you away from being who you are and want to be its your life to live not theirs they shouldn't hold you back
I think it would be very helpful for you to find out what is possible. Maybe there are some things you can do, e.g. clothes or make-up, more ""female"" movements or forms of address (e.g. online) that will make you feel better. If you are of age, you can also take hormones without your family knowing. Nothing is impossible, there are always many options between ""all or nothing"", many small steps in between that make life easier. And I think it would be very good if you make a plan to become financially independent and build new relationships so that this decision is not so existential anymore.
I'm going to guess most of us are worried what we'll end up looking like. I know I am.

It turns out hormones are magic, though.

Just look through r/MtF for posts about ""seeing her"" for the first time, or stories of first self passes. Look at before and afters to see how wildly appearance can change. More than appearance, though, listen to what they say about happiness and their journey.

It's scary. It's uncertain. It's complicated. It's difficult. It's the greatest decision I've ever made. I'm so proud of my past self for taking the first steps.

It will be even harder without a supportive family, but you will find genes don't need to determine your real family. You will be independent of them and free to make deep connections with people who love and support the real you.

You deserve love, and you will get it for being you.

Stay strong sister.
That's the whole validation thing I'm talking about. When imposter syndrome kicks in or when you feel down, there  are always people here to remind you that your goals are achievable, that you're legit and that it's okay to take things your rythm. 

You're welcome sis
I guarantee you there’s trans people everywhere, they’re just not visible or out. Different places will have different populations/demographics, and if you’re somewhere smaller, I was in the same situation. Small town, only a handful of out/visible LGBT people, but the sense of community is strong there and even stronger in larger populations. In the meantime, make some LGBT friends online who you can talk to and get guidance from, and this sub is a good place to do it! Or just engage with LGBT content like YouTubers/streamers if you’re into that sort of thing, they’re good places to find people with similar interests in your online communities. There’s also a lot of written material to explore if you like to read. Things don’t even have to be LGBT oriented, just inclusive spaces and content to help you along and find things you can identify with and find others who like the same stuff. 

And that’s excellent, I’ve personally found a lot of power in things like that in a similar way. Keep it up, reach out if you need help or guidance. There’s younger, theres older, trans people from every walk of life in all colors and places. There’s bound to be people who can help out, and in turn, you can offer help as you learn to people in the future. Keep up with trying out your new pronouns and even play around with them if you’d like, and take the direction you want. Nothing is as urgent as it seems - don’t feel the need to rush or put yourself in a box that has a checklist. Go at your own pace and be kind and forgiving of yourself on your way to be your best. ^^ Best of luck and wish you good times ahead!
That’s good that you’ve already experienced that euphoria and have experimented with feminine things. From your reply, it sounds like you already know that you’ll be happier as a woman — even if you don’t end up looking exactly like the woman you imagine in your mind.

Have you spoken with your trans family members to see how they’ve handled that inter-family conflict?
Well yes. Pretty privilege is very real. For all women. Not just trans girls. But I was “non-pretty” for most of my transition. I would get called f*ggot on the street on the reg. But I persevered and let my hair grow out and let HRT do it’s work, and then little by little it all stopped. The majority of ppl I kno of any age pass pretty much after 2 years or so HRT. Just to say that in almost all cases ppl go much farther in their transition than they expect possible at the beginning.

And this is anecdotal, but a lot of the people who end up not passing are pretty heavy on the autism spectrum. There’s nothing wrong with them, but I think that being on the spectrum insulates people from the social communicative aspect of gender expression. I don’t kno what you’re like, but if you’re generally socially aware I’d say that you’ll end up way better looking than you imagine.

DM me if you wanna see some pics of my awkward phase 😇
Being yourself shouldnt hurt people, that's their problem. And I think anyone has that bravery in there. I didn't know I did but here we are! Take your time and take it easy! If you ever need, you can anonymously talk to the Trevor Project. They are free professionals who can help you when you are having a crisis or even just a bad day! Good luck!
Its a strange feeling the first time you can feel normal. When you have that much pent up anxiety or stress it becomes normalized, its not until you can unload it until you can realize just how bad it had gotten. But everything you feel, and everything you are as an individual are all normal, I'm happy you can feel that <3
Well, that's something you gotta decide... I'm just trying to say the truth is usually stranger than the fiction we create in our minds. I thought it was not possible for me either. 

For a long time, I just accepted I'm trans & nothing to do about it 'cept, like you, playing female characters in games. Or alter egos online.

Now, I'm starting to believe that I'll develop into a beautiful woman... Eventually. But, ty for saying I'm pretty 🥰 It all starts with changing bad self-thinking habits.
I agree. It’s although sometimes confidence is what makes people hot. But this isn’t me arguing with your decision, although I suspect you came here to see what people might say to protest it.

I am very likely never going to transition myself. My family would be embarrassed and I don’t know how I would fit into society anymore. I have no friends to support me so it doesn’t feel worth it no matter how much it hurts.

And just like you I don’t think I’ll ever be as handsome as I wish I was.
Google, sis. I guarantee someone has asked and answered just about every question you'll have. 

Short answer: You see an endocrinologist or any doctor familiar with trans healthcare (you can find lists for your area) and they change lots of little things. How you smell, skin tone, boobs, sex drive, etc. 

It's really nice, but not a magic pill that cures everything. Some things (like your voice, style, haircare, etc) take a lot of work. It's totally possible and worth it, though.

Well I haven't been around anyone for the past year or so, but it has helped for me to exclusively wear ""women's"" underwear. Also I have worked from home for the past 4 years and usually fully wear what I want when in my office. I wear what I want at night when alone with my partner. They recently bought me an inexpensive pair of breast forms which has helped so much. I have never gone any where in girl mode except for driving around in the car at night.

It's honestly expensive to buy two separate wardrobes, buy I'm lucky that I fit into most of my partner's dresses although some are a bit short. Their support has been amazing.

Ultimately this journey is for each individual to figure out for themselves, but I hope this helped.
😂 I like the way you look at things and I see so many trans woman who are insanely beautiful and I just want that for me aswell but I feel like it's just not possible because I've tried those filters that show you how you look as the opposite gender and its usually not a pretty sight lol

Hopefully it isnt weird but if you know the streamer f1nn5ter hes a crossdresser and it's the closest I can find to how I envisioned myself
That’s the second time I’ve heard that “ if somethings worth doing, it’s worth doing poorly” thing. I think it’s really smart and wise, because there are a lot of us that have horrible times trying some thing or starting some thing or whatever because of that issue.
I'm just afraid the real me will look like a gremlin 😂
Thank you I hope one day soon I can have that life ❤
I'm happy your life has turned around for the better you seem like such a sweet person ❤
Interesting, I didn't know that. I'll have to look up that segment.
I don't even know if that's possible I've lived with the idea of her since I was even a little kid and I understand not every trans person needs to be a model but I just really want to be her if that makes any sense idk
It's not my choice though but thanks
Fr I 100% think this would be the outcome
Yeah ik but I'm still somewhat young and I need them for housing and food
Yeah I never really thought to much about my gender until really today when I made my post but I noticed some stuff like when I was little I would always ask my mom to paint my nails for Halloween and she would always respond with ""no that's gay and you're a boy"" and I would just go along with it 

And yeah I want to become more independent I just don't know if I could give up my family as I still do love them despite their beliefs and this might make me sound incredibly stupid but wouldn't they notice if I took hormones?
Sadly no they've kinda distanced themselves from my side of the family so I wouldn't know how to get in contact with them
Yeah but I just know I would be hated by my family and right now they are literally my world and idk what I'd do without them

How do I get in contact with them though? I've heard about it before but never knew how
Very true I've had a good 1 or 2 cries over this post and the response I've gotten from it its been almost a decade since I first showed real signs of being a woman guess she finally wanted to come out
I didn't make my post to start drama sorry if I did I'm just not very confident in myself now or hot for that matter and I see so many gorgeous women on this sub who seem happy and confident with how they turned out and I also want that for me 

And yeah it's sad there is still a very huge stigma around being trans hopefully one day that will go away and people can be happy with who they are I hope one day you can find that peace
No it's not weird at all, I love Finn! He's really entertaining. 
Just don't forget that his dad is a hairdresser, he gets a lot of clothes gifted to him from fans, he has money, and he had a female friend teach him about makeup and did his makeup the first few times.

Secondly, the filters don't work on everyone, don't worry. They are mostly a gimmick, something funny to try, they aren't a legitimate representation of how you'd look if you transitioned.
Heh filters reallyyyy screwed up when they tried to feminize me, and that was with pretty soft features to start. Faceapp did better than the rest, but even that wasn't all to great at it until I was already three months into HRT.

I wouldn't put too much weight into filters. 

Also F1nn5ter is amazing but his completely unsafe handling of knives scares me sooo much
Thank you 🥰
Just because it makes a sort of sense doesn’t mean it’s healthy thinking patterns. Would living with a cancerous tumour from childhood make the tumour any less of a tumour? No! It still needs attention and care to heal and become a healthy adult eventually.
What part of this isn't your choice?
Please ignore that person I've seen them spamming that video everywhere today.
You probably should've mentioned that XD but yes you should definitely come out when it's safe for you to do so
Not necessarily, because the changes are very slow and not necessarily visible if you take estrogen. Common changes are for example that skin becomes softer, hair becomes thinner (beard, arms, legs, back, torso), maybe improved grow of head hair  (if you have hair loss activated by testerone). Usually there is breast growth, but it can vary and is also slow. The fat redistributes slowly, so e.g. facial features can become softer and fat is attached to the hips rather than the abdomen. It is important to remember that hormone threatment results in  limited fertility and, in some cases, erection problems. The dosage should best be monitored by a doctor. If the dosage is too high, kidney problems may occur.
It sounds like it could be really helpful to find a way to get in touch with them, yeah? They could offer some helpful perspective and lend some needed support. I can’t think of anyone who would better understand what you’re going through than them.
Family is difficult. It might take time but maybe there is some warming up you can do. Try to have some conversations about it. Maybe you'd be surprised or at least you can start to get them on a more tolerant path. 

Literally just Google Trevor Project. They have a number you can text or call, you can chat online. It's super easy and don't feel like ""it's not for you"". It is! People are looking out for you!
I wasn’t saying that you were starting drama at all. I’ve made a similar post before to see what people might say to make me feel better or egg me on.

I think we’re in a similar position. Maybe one day things will change for us. Know that your beauty inside still reaches people outside.

And thank you sweetheart.
Ig but hes attractive as a guy aswell so that adds a little bit
I tried using faceapp and it honestly wasnt horrible and if I were to transition I'd want those soft features but idk how likely that would be 

And yeah some other people said they aren't 100% correct but I just wish I could how I'd look so that I don't end up looking like an actual monster 😂
Well I guess it technically is but I love my family and I would really put them over anything because I rely on them
Yeah I guess but I don't even know his name or really anything about him my family always just calls him the f word
Awe thank you I misread what you said but that end part goes for you aswell even if the world never gets to see it you are very handsome 😊
I love my dad, and he is hella homophobic. I would never even think about sacrificing who I am becuase I love him
your family's abusing you homegirl. Any situation in which you have to deny a part of yourself for someone else is self-harm and abusive.
I’m sorry to hear that they call them that. 😔 Well, if some detective work isn’t out of the question, it certainly sounds like there would be benefit to finding out their name and making contact.

I know that things seem hopeless right now. I feel like the best thing to do right now is to find a positive voice that you can talk to in-person, whether it’s this family member, or someone outside of your family like a counselor.

Remember there is a world where you can live as yourself and be loved — and we’re in it right now. This community loves you for who you are, and I’m sure we aren’t the only ones.
❤️❤️❤️
I get that but my family is literally all that I have without them I'm lonely and homeless and unfortunately I have to sacrifice being happy for that
I know it's not right what they're doing but I don't know what my other options are
Your family needs to love and accept you as well.  Holding these feelings you're having in and bottling them can be very harmful to your mental health long term.

I hope you can find help and a path forward."	povchi	trans	325	0.99	2021-09-15 17:58:41
Dear Mom and Dad	"You constantly ask me about living life as a man, as if I have a plan? 
You like to complain that I don’t have any friends and that I don’t have a life? 

What if this thing called “life” isn’t up to you?
What if this life is strictly mine?
What if this life is something other than what you see, in the outwardly?

I may be a “man” to you, but what if there is something more?
Something that you can’t see, feel, or understand?

When I look at myself, I don’t see man. 
Sure, there may be masculinity, but it’s not an eternity...
Femininity is the key.

You ask me why I’m sad, why I’m depressed... 
I just tell you that I’m good, but in all actuality, I’m not...

I’m different on the inside... 
I don’t know when you’re going to realize it, or if you will ever see it, 
but...

I’m not your son. 

I am your daughter."	"basically sums up what I wish I could say to my parents, would you mind if I saved this for the future?
You stay strong girl! You'll show em whos boss!
*hugs* hope your doing ok op, I kinda know how this feels, I'm out to my dad but he always calls me his son and or by my deadname
Stay strong.  If you need an Auntie, I got you fam!  You could be my niece. 💜💙💚💛🧡❤
Well written, tell them who you are. there more to life than living miserable

I'm MtF but I'm actually rather feminine (as in like my body type is quite feminine) and I pass already, could you please reword this to something more accurate? The masculinity bit is just innacturate basically 😅
So well said. If families and every could just accept and support. That would be a great world.
I love you so much and I respect you a lot. Don't listen to the haters, I'm sure you're a beautiful woman and a joy to be around! If they don't like you for being you, then they don't deserve you. Please stay safe. I love you.
-peace and love ✌💕
This is exactly the same to me. I guess this is Mor common than I expected
This made my shitty day into a good one, this post is so relatable for me, so it just feels good to know I’m not the only one going through this stuff, I hope everything works out for you and good luck!
Oh sweetie! I can literally feel your fear in this letter. But let me tell you this, it will be worth jumping into the fear because behind that is something better. If you don’t get the support you need, you got your fellow brothers and sisters here! Take this at your pace though. I can’t express that enough. Baby steps or big steps. You got this <3 -Kaitlynn
no, not at all! Go ahead!
I have two years left... Unless I start HRT secretively.
I’m actually not doing well at all... Been depressed, like I mentioned in this poem, and it’s bringing me to a point where I want to start HRT under my parents noses... I’m thinking of calling PP to see if I can do Informed Consent next week.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
If only I could be honest...
No no, I totally get it! I’m the same way... My body type is basically feminine aside from some characteristics...
Exactly...
Thank you so much. I appreciate the kind words!
It sure is
Thank you! Same to you, Avery!
Thank you Kaitlynn. I appreciate the kind words! It is definitely a struggle...
thank you, I really appreciate it! <3

im a cis guy that feels like a lesbian. help	"Ok so I figured out you gals would know about this kind of issues so let me get started.

Sooo im a cis guy and currently I dont want to date anyone because I find it odd to be a guy dating. I dont know why. If I were to date a girl I would LOVE for it to be a wlw relationship, nevertheless, it feels like Im fetishizing their relationships and I feel like a creep when I think about it.

When I think of a mlw or mlm relationship I just... no... I dont feel attracted to being in a gay men relationship or to dating women with a dynamic where im a man. It makes me feel sad when I think about me not being able to experience retibuted love in a way that makes me truly enjoy it. I dont know what to do or what it means. Every day I hate my body more and more and I dont know what can I do. Its so limiting!!!

And when I see wlw relationships in any form of media or irl I just think that I wont be able to ever achieve that. **Why do I care so much? why? why? why? why?**

I wish I could be a lesbian.

I wish I could feel pretty in womens clothes.

I wish I could escape this feeling of being trapped in my own self.

I wish I could feel not disconnected from reality.

I wish I could stop feeling like a creep.

I wish I could be the most real version of myself

help"	"lets just say i went down the ""im a cis girl who wants to be in a gay mlm relationship"" to the ""wait shit i AM a gay guy"" pipeline so youre in for a ride
Hmmm.  If I were in your shoes, I'd definitely be re-evaluating whether or not I'm really cis.  You might want to check out the Gender Dysphoria Bible at https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en and see if any of it resonates with you.
Well, if that's how you feel... i would maybe think about the cis part again 😅

Especialy the last sentences Sound to me like you could be trans. Many have their egg cracking for the ""loving women in a gay way"" part or the feeling disconnected part.

I can't promise that the ""creep feeling"" stuff will go away. That's sometimes partly because of society or internalized transphobia.

I would maybe think about it a bit more. Sure, the wlw part could be fetishizing to some point but the other stuff doesn't speak for that.
Hey, thus is a perfectly valid feeling. I'm a trans lesbian. before I started transitioning I felt extremely jealous every time I saw a lesbian couple. I wanted what they had. I wanted to love like they do and be perceived like they are. Taking a peak at your page I can tell you've been having a rough time with your identity. I know it's not an easy process but since you're posting it here I think it's worth mentioning that it's alright to be a trans lesbian. Even if you haven't done any surgery or hormones or anything. You are entitled to your sense of self. If you feel like a transgender lesbian then that's what you are. And there is someone out there that will love you in the way that you need.

>I wish I could be a lesbian.

>I wish I could feel pretty in womens clothes.

>I wish I could escape this feeling of being trapped in my own self.

>I wish I could feel not disconnected from reality.

>I wish I could stop feeling like a creep.

>I wish I could be the most real version of myself

You can actually do all of these things. 

I would never tell someone I’ve never met that they’re trans, but I think a lot of self reflection and a good therapist that specializes in gender identity would be a really good for you.
I had some similar thoughts before my egg cracked
I'll just say, out of all the LGBT+ communities you could have asked, you came specifically to the trans subreddit. Sounds like you might already have a specific answer you wanted to hear.
So, as a trans guy, one of the first signs I had that something wasn't quite what I thought was that dating seemed really unappealing as a woman but intriguing as a man. 

Before I realized anything, I was really into mlm stuff, I imagined myself in mlm relationships, etc. And I felt like a horrible person, because there's this narrative of ""AFAB people who are into mlm ships are evil fetishizing homophobes!!!"" So I was ashamed for years, but I couldn't just stop - straight or lesbian relationships just didn't appeal to me, so what was I supposed to do, quit liking romance?

Then I started thinking about it more deeply - about how I wanted to be seen, what made me happy, how I felt in X vs Y situation - and I realized that I was a guy. And then, obviously, the mlm thing made sense - ""oh, I'm not a horrible evil cis girl! I'm a gay man who was connecting with media that showed the kind of relationships I want to have!"" Turns out that's a common experience for gay trans men.

The point is, while I don't want to push anything on you, your experience sounds a lot like mine (except, obviously, reversed.) Might be worth thinking about other parts of your life and whether ""I'm a trans woman"" (or transfemme in general) might explain some things.
I had similar feelings before I had any gender identity thoughts in my head as well.


Try exploring alternative gender expressions
Please take this as a present : r/egg_irl
I felt like this before I realized I'm trans except with the genders flipped around. Just take your time and experiment<3
I recommend at least talking to a gender therapist. They will be neutral while you figure this out. Answer questions you might have. And hell who knows who you really are. 

Congratulations on the start of a journey. No matter how it ends up.
I actually feel similar. Apparently according to a post I made I don't have cis thinking (biological male here) 

It's not the same bc I do like men and mlm does sound normal to me, but I also have an attraction to women as well. The only thing is that I don't rlly wanna be ""the man"" of that relationship and I tend to like more dominant ppl and also other fem guys (I'm a switch) 

Not quite sure if I'm trans or nonbinary, or just gender non comforming. However I'd love to just live my life without any restrictions in regards to the fact I'm male. I strive to be as androgonous as possible

You could be a femboy, or you could be a trans woman. The question I'd ask urself would be ""how do I see myself in my happiest in the future.
Ask yourself, ""If everything in my life goes well, and I am at my happiest, where will I be in 10 years?""

If the answer is being a woman, in a happy and healthy relationship with another woman, then I think you've probably cracked it. Pun intended.

But really, this isn't something others can just straight up tell you the answer to, as awesome as that would be. Ultimately it is up to you to discover, and experiment, and figure out your own identity. It is really scary to imagine a life so different to the one you have lived so far - not to mention how awful elements of the trans experience are currently - and I think that's probably a large reason as to why so many people seem to suffer over this questioning stage. But at the end of the day, if you're trans, then it would be a life that is certainly worth living, despite everything.

Whatever your decision is on this, though, you are always welcome here! Love you sweetie and I seriously wish you the best x
This was quite relatable tbh. I remember from a previous ""cishet"" relationship constantly thinking ""Wow her family are so accepting of our lesbian relationship"" even though I was clearly a masc presenting male at the time.
These are such common first steps in the realization that you are indeed the person you wish to be already, you’re just buried under narratives of who we are supposed to be. This is not an easy journey, but it is always worth it to have everything you ever wanted. You can have that cake and eat it, too. Life gets so so much better hun. 

I would take this opportunity to trust in your own self to get where you want to go in time and just allow yourself to be without any judgement as you begin exploring the possibility that you may be a woman who feels oppressed by the imposed need to be a man, because that is what you’ve always been told. Please know you have an entire loving community here and elsewhere to make all your experiences easier and less lonely. You’re gonna be okay, love, I promise. I’m excited to hear that you’re on track to discovering how fulfilling life can be when you live your dreams as the reality you deserve. 

Be that lesbian, it sounds like you already are. ❤️
.................feel like you know what's going on........................ we're here for you, we got you, welcome to the rest of your life.
i used to say that all the time before my egg cracked!! turned out i was right🥰🥰
You're not a creep, you might wanna consider that you might not be a dude, but also keep in mind that if you feel like a dude still there is genders like bigender or pangender
Oh OP! I know that feeling so well. In reverse sort of, but still. Identified as a lesbian for a long time, but it bugged me to be someone's girlfriend. I wanted to be their boyfriend, dammit!! Being in a wlw relationship for me felt the way being in a mlw one feels for you now.
Well, anyway, turned out I'm transmasc.

When you instinctively feel a certain way, listen to your gut. You already know who you are and what you want, so trust yourself.
Still cis though 😅
Sounds rather trans
Try watching some of The L Word or the new League of Their Own. 

If you end up a teary mess wishing that was you on the screen, I suggest making some calls to the gender therapists near you and checking that your insurance covers hormone therapy.

Also, I'd be careful how much I apply the label ""cis guy"" to myself if I were you. It's a pain to scrape that thing off.
I'm not going to tell you who you are or aren't, but I'm a trans lesbian and felt much like you describe for decades until I figured it out. Always crushing on queer women and envying them, feeling like a creep for being attracted to them, thinking I was ugly, being unable to care for myself, being depressed and feeling disconnected from the world and myself all the time.

I'm still pre-everything medically speaking, but I've gained a lot of confidence since cracking my egg and starting to come out to my social circles.
i thought i was a gay man originally, and now i’m a trans woman who can’t stand men (cis men, trans dudes are hawt kings 👑)
you’re prolly not a cis guy, lol
Well um... I can't really add much since it looks like others have already given the exact advice I would've... But uh... Welcome to the sub. And I look forward to seeing your journey.
Welcome to the club girl!!!

I had a lot of similar feelings and thoughts as yourself. A lot of my friends are lesbians so lesbian relationships were so normalised for me that my dumbass thought it was perfectly cis to think of myself as one of the girls and honorary lesbian. It took years for me to connect the dots. I wish you all the best in your journey
Hey!!! 

I just wanted to say that this is 100% how I felt and probably still feel. 

And you know what? It’s okay. Yes, it’ll take time, but there’s nothing wrong with how you feel.
I think it sounds to me like you might be trans but that's only something you can decide
Discovering being trans and lesbian is kinda funny, cuz then there is the thing like ""are you gay or something?"" And is like ""yeah, but it's not the way you think"" Idk gurl, being trans and lesbian is kinda hard before transition. I recommend dating bi and pansexual women, they are the most opened.
kinda sus man idk
🥚
There was a small male lesbian movement in the '00s.  Not sure where it went.

I don't know if I'd necessarily call you cis.  You're definitely toeing the line of being a binary trans woman.
look, you are likely NOT a cis dude
I was in this exact situation not too long ago, and it sorta helped me in the end to realise that I was just in denial about being trans! Of course, we're both different people so I don't wanna come across as knowing you better than yourself, but for me at least I just really had to take some time to really reflect on how I truly felt to come to this conclusion. I hope everything goes well for you,  whatever conclusion you come to!
Be who you are. FYP
You’re saying a lotta non cis stuff friend. A lot of the time this is how it starts. Do some searching and see what you find.

Also: we’re not all gals. Non binary people, trans men and trans masc people also live here ;)
OP, you very likely might not be cis. Do feminine ways of expression give you euphoria? Do you get a *deeply* personal fluttering feeling when you see lesbian romances portrayed in media? There is something deep within you that seems to be yearning for who you *are*— not what you are not.
I felt the same before my egg cracked and it confused me a lot as it seemed physically impossible and makes no sense. I could never imagine a relationship as a guy and wished to re reborn as a girl, but still took time until out figured out to be trans.
I was a cis girl who was really into gay men. But like, that didn’t make sense because I wasn’t gay, and I wasn’t a man. I couldn’t be into men in a gay way if I was a cishet girl right?? 

Now I’m a trans bi man. So like… you know. 

Tbh what started the whole thing for me was the way I really liked Yaoi and mlm stuff in fandom spaces. I was 10-16 and felt gross and bad, and thought I was fetishizing gay men. Yeah turns out, I wasn’t. I just didn’t know I was a man who was fantasizing. 

Fantasizing =\= fetishizing as it turns out. 

I also felt bad when I tried to date girls because I didn’t like girls the way other girls did. I didn’t want to be in a lesbian relationship, I wanted to be in a straight relationship. Which again: didn’t make sense because I was a cishet girl. 
Ha

Ha 

Hahaha

Hahahahahahhahahahahahahahhaha 

Anyway, maybe hang around here and the egg subreddit for a bit. Explore yourself, and what gender and your identity mean. Maybe you’re a cis man that just wants to embrace femininity. Maybe you’re a trans woman. Maybe you’re none of the above. Maybe you just like the stereotypical dynamics in a wlw relationship vs others. Who knows? You gotta explore the path before you find your destination.
I felt the same way, realised I'm non-binary.
r/egg_irl
Remindme! One year
If there was a button that turned you into a woman would you press it
Looks like the good advice is covered so

🥚 EGG
I believe that the fact that you posted this on r/trans means that you have an idea of what the real issue is here. From what I’m seeing, all the comments are saying that you should reevaluate being a cis man, but these opinions are heavily biased since you’re asking the trans community. I suggest maybe asking the lesbian community and seeing what they think.

TL:DR: get more opinions from different communities, instead of just asking the one that is going to give you the answer you wanna hear.
I went from feeling like a girl who’s envious of mlm relationships, to a gay boy, to a bisexual man, now to someone who feels both male and female at different points and is mostly attracted to women. Gender and sexuality are crazy journeys sometimes that don’t completely make sense but it’s a ride worth taking if you’re safe to!
I once thought the same way and now I am a gay man. Sounds like it might be worth exploring properly the possibility of transitioning, even if that's socially.
Wait… I saw your post on another sub! [insert Spider-Man meme template here]
Im sorry but youre VERY LIKEY not cis bro
I dont get to decide that kinda thing, but you should probably look into that (especially cos you CAN be a woman in a wlw release!)
that's how I was not too long ago. Honestly most of the people here too. what you're feeling isn't unheard of and we understand you. maybe draw what you would want to be like then little by little take steps to get there? just don't be unrealistic with it like completely different face shape, eye shape Ect...  you will discover your true self and feel beautiful one day it's just a process. hang in there it'll be worth it 💞
Hehe *nudges arm* not trying to say you are or aren’t anything but uh sounds like you might be trans lol. Maybe not but sounds like you are! If you ever need any help or support please reach out!
I am in a Relationship with a man and transition slowly makes me into a lesbian so...that's fun
You are now a lesbian. Congratulations!
tbh i was confused why i always felt like i was supposed to be gay or queer but as a girl.       well now im a queer aroace so  yeah. 

btw you are definitely not a creep, its a pretty normal thing for trans people to think that. i would guess youre probably not a cis guy. but if you aren't a girl, theres always demigirl and non binary (well demigirl counts as non binary but you get my point) there are more options and its really liberating finding yourself
This sounds like me before I realized I was mtf. Now, I'm not necessarily saying you ARE trans, that's for you to figure out. What I am saying is that this seems like a pretty big sign of it, given my very personal experience. Literally everything you've said there is stuff I thought, the lesbian part, the women's clothes part, the creep part, all of it. Just be you, do some soul searching and figure out who you are. Good luck and godspeed.
Ah yes. The absolutely manly and cis urge to be a lesbian
I resonate with this a lot, I'm more fluid than solely wanting to be a girl but I'm really struggling atm because I like girls and feel like a girl sometimes but also a guy. I'm just really really confused
Just saying, the feelings you're having are exactly the feelings I had when I was a teenager that eventually led me to realizing I was trans. 

Being trans doesn't have to be a negative, dysphoria-centered thing. For a lot of people, myself included, desire is more important than lack when it comes to gender. It's a beautiful thing.
Yeah I went down this path just the opposite, I literally said for years I’m a gay man traps inside a girls body smh. Hope you can find your true self and live your truth ❤️.
I remember thinking the same way with mlm relationships and thinking I was fetishising gay relationships and felt creepy doing it
Hey! I have been feeling the same way for years and rationalised it as having a 'better masculinity' than my peers (super humble!). Turns out that new improved masculinity was my feminity! Can't say definitely the same for you but turns out I'm some vibe of transfemme.
I really relate to this. I was born female, and thought I was a lesbian for the longest time. However, I have never related to lesbians. I didn’t feel like I actually belonged in that category. Something was off… but I was definitely attracted to women and fem people. Last year I realized I was trans and it all made sense.
This was something I was battling with back when I thought I was cis, turns out I'm actually a trans woman. I used to get so sad and worked up because it was ""something I could never have"" and was worried I was fetishising lesbians when what I really had an issue with was my own gender. Hope my experience can help you figure out how you feel etc.
Have you considered that maybe you in fact ARE trans and just haven't explored the idea?
You’re either a closeted lesbian (aka a trans woman) or you’re genderfluid
You may just want to be with a masculine or dynamically dominant woman. Sometimes that feeling can make you feel like you have to be a woman to be in that situation because of social roles. 

You can be in a straight relationship that ""feels queer"" by nature of the woman being the dominant and leading one, it's how my relationship dynamic works and I love it.

Do also remember that men can dress femininely, your gender doesn't dictate your clothing
The feeling like a creep thing is so true.

One of the best feelings about transitioning happened around 2 years in, when I was chatting with a girl I know about lesbian-themed novels and graphic novels and movies. She reads/watches them too, and she's a lesbian, and we just talked all about our favourites and swapped recommendations and so on, and it felt like the opposite of creepy, it was like empowering, like as consumers of this content we were supporting a community of creators we respect and identify with. I wasn't appropriating anything, nor misusing it or whatever, I was literally smack in the centre of its target audience. And a big chunk of internalized transphobia just slid away, like melting ice falling off the roof in springtime (sorry, I'm Canadian, lol).  It was like, wtf, WHY was I ever ashamed by this? (Rhetorical question, don't answer, lol.)
I remember waaaay back in high school a friend would joke that they were a lesbian trapped in a mans body. I never laughed at that one. It pretty much described me, and felt way too close to home. Somehow I suspected I was trans back then, but chose not to act on it.

A quarter century later I'm transitioning, and that dude's still one of my best friends.
Been there done this exact thought process, best of luck on your journey. We are always here and willing to talk if you want to. Slide someone adm I'm sure they would be happy to help you.
this ride seems like the best worst ride im about to have. thnaks
“I’m a cis girl, why do I feel like I attracted to men in a gay way???” 

Years later: “…oh.”
Oh geeze, I remember the days of denial and confusion.  So glad they're behind me now.
Yeah same here. You definitely do not sound cis, OP.
Not the OP, but looked into that link and I think some kind of egg cracked a little. I'm gonna look more into it
This website was a much needed wake-up call for me. I’d searched up stuff before that never really helped at all, but this actually got me to think for the last few hours about everything up till now and helped to solidify my feelings.

I’ve heard of the Gender Dysphoria Bible before, but this was the first time actually looking into it and understanding what it really was. Thank you so much for sharing this.
Didn't know that was a thing
I don’t know if OP will see this, but I’ve long worried about being creepy and as it turns out it’s because my dysphoria tells me that the body I was born with is digesting and revolting so OF COURSE anyone would be creeped out if I thought they were attractive. 

Yeah, dysphoria is a bitch
aghh, I do feel like the label of a ""lesbian"" really resonates with me but jeshfnossajd idk I feel like I wont ever be able to date anyone because of this and its a sad reality to never experience that kind of love. I also feel jealous when I see lesbian couples too. Im kind of obsessed over it as a guy and I feel like a wierdo, yknow...?

best of luck girl, hope you find love too
funny enough I have a therapist that is good with this kind of stuff, she is the thing that makes me keep going, I like her so much! and what do you exactly mean by self reflection?
Me too, really I think allowing myself to recognize that feeling (2yrs ago) was the first major crack, even though I didn't really hatch until recently
🥲

denial and dobut suck but idk maybe you are right, I could have asked a lesbian community or something
it does explain some things, I wish I could be a woman but it seems out of reach and im in denial, I know I am in denial and I cant stop.
>Try exploring alternative gender expressions

currently I just tried skirts and face app ^((which i loved using)) and tbh I think I should also try makeup painting nails and other stuff but I dont knoooooowww... where to get that or to use it so fuck.
they make good memes lol discovered them some time ago
thank youuuuuu
>""If everything in my life goes well, and I am at my happiest, where will I be in 10 years?""

prolly would have transitioned... -.- 

And yeah It would be scary at first to live a life where so many things change but, I strive for those changes, I want to have them. The questioning stage sucks but I feel that the only thing that is holding me back is the denial of the denial of the denial.
HOYL FUCK IM BOUT TO CRY YOU ARE SO SWEEEEEET 

I relate to the first paragraph a lot, currently im realizing that if I keep waiting for what I want to happen to magically happen, it wont happen. I have to bite the bullet and keep working to realize who truly is the person inside my body.
yeah I have a slight feeling i might be a woman hahah
im starting to feel like a dude less and less as time passes, im just stuck in this limbo of not feeling like anything.
lmao is my life a transgender allegory
What is the first step?
thnaks, it feels so nice to have access to communities like this that are so supportive!
wait what?? is this so close to how you feel as a transfem?
mogus
From what I heard a lot of them transitioned lmao.
ah sorry for using gals btw, didnt notice
Do feminine ways of expression give you euphoria? 

well I have not tried a lot yet but what I tried was so nice, I love dresses and lipstick now.

Also I have felt jealousy of plent of queer relationships but not straight ones, I waant what I caant have lmao
truly one of the moments of all time
I would have a existencial crisis in front of the button tbh
TL:DR: get more opinions from different communities, instead of just   
asking the one that is going to give you the answer you wanna hear.

thats actually I great idea, even if yall cant tell me anything about my identity Its nice to have the opinion of multiple groups and also idk I figured I would ask yall since I figured yall also felt like me at some point.
yeah I posted it here too because I thought no one would see it but lmao it blew up
I know right, I swear every cis guy I know wants to be a cute lesbian dating another cute lesbian and do cute lesbian things together
but the kind of relationships I am thinking of arent like a top or bottom kind of thing, it would be 2 fem presenting girls dating each other, not a inherently dominant and summisive dynamic. Also Im glad you have found the person that you love!  <3

btw I know men can dress fem, Ive done it myself and it was great!

(I have yet to try make up though -.-)
Yeah my attraction to women was always way different than my cis male peers. I was always crushing on the lesbian girls in hs. Realized it’s bc I’m lesbian lmaooo
Good luck dear egg! We’re here if you need us!
exactly haha but I promise you the good that comes is incomparable to anything you could ever imagine, it’s worth it and you have so many others going through the tougher parts with you, you’re not alone in this and you absolutely got this, even when it feels like you really don’t
Being trans is very difficult, but also very rewarding in my opinion. I love it, and wouldn’t change a thing
Definitely went through a similar struggle. Nearly every woman I dated before I came out was bi, and all my crushes were on bi or lesbian women. I just didn't realize that I was also a woman (despite some of the signs).

If you are interested in transitioning, any number of people on this sub can direct you to resources if you want.
Seconding this but its a painful ride that pays off in the end to live your best and honest life. Lots of love and welcome to the family
Gonna be the hardest but also most rewarding ride you will ever take
Sigh... No one explained this shit for me but god damn it the journey is a fucking trip without instructions.
:,) im glad
😅
Just finished reading it after someone recommended it on my own post and I am now 100% confident that in transgender. The bit where it said ""wanting to transition but being scared of being an ugly girl is, in itself, a form of dysmorphia"" thats the moment my egg cracked and I just started crying.
yes the OP and I feel the same way, I looked at it in other comment. shits relatable fr
You're welcome.  I'm glad it helped you. 💜
I did see it and I thank you for sharing your experience with me :,D 

and yeah I also so happen to have a low self esteem about my body so theres that
r/actuallesbians is super trans accepting and has done wonders for my own acceptance of my sexuality 🥰
mean if you want to be a lesbian women then you can go be a lesbian women XD

You'd probably have a hard time pre hrt in terms if dating but depending on where you are its nit impossible
There are definitely people out there who'll love you for you, trans or cis. I can confirm, I fell in love with my (trans) gf before she was able to pursue transition, and we're still very gay despite her having cracked my transmasc egg. Ignore anyone who says you can't find love if you're pre-transition, they're full of crap. And even if you're cis (which I have my doubts about), there's someone out there who'll see you and click with you and love you the way you want to be loved.

And you're not weird for wanting that. Wanting to be seen and loved in the way you want isn't weird or creepy or rude. It's you; being yourself is never a bad thing.
Jealousy doesn’t really sound like fetishizing, honestly. It sounds like you wish you could be a woman in a lesbian relationship, which… if that sounds appealing to you: you’re allowed. You can be a woman if you want to be. And you can be a trans lesbian.
The other people said it too but I wanna reiterate. There are people that would love to date you, and many would be happy with you at any point in a hypothetical transition. Personally my partner is pansexual. And there is no shortage of transfemmes who love other transfemmes. In fact we are a huge part of the community.
nah there's people who'll love you for you. I've been out as a trans guy for about 6 months and my bi gf has been nothing but supportive. as for myself, I'd say I'm exclusively into women but i have an openness to any desire or urge that may arise within myself at any time. I'm typically into more feminine traits, and I'd definitely date a trans woman even if the transition isn't over (maybe even not started, never happened before tho)
I’m sapphic af and have had the most amazing, wonderfully gay and loving experiences with other women. Being trans can seem scary in the romance department, but once you start loving yourself you see that being trans is actually hot af and an immeasurable amount of people, both cis and trans, agree wholeheartedly. You can, and I’m certain will, have the lesbian relationships you are dreaming of.
I live something similar, whenever I see lesbian couples my heart races, I feel envious and I wanna be in a wlw relationship because it looks so cute and I wanna cuddle and be cuddled. I don't know my true sexuality but this feeling makes me certain that I may be a lesbian together with other attractions I may have.
Oh good, I’m so glad! Keep talking with her. 

By self reflection I just mean continue thinking about yourself and what you want and who you are. A ton of us here relate extremely, extremely well to the experiences you’re writing about. Just saying. 

Also, [this article](https://genderanalysis.net/2017/06/depersonalization-in-gender-dysphoria-widespread-and-widely-unrecognized/) might be a useful read for you.
No I think you came to the right place. 

Denial is so hard because once you rid yourself of the lies the immeasurable guilt starts to set in. But don't let it get you down, what you're going through, everyone else here is too. 

Stay strong, stay educated, stay safe.
I cannot speak for cisgender men because I'm not one, but I get the distinct impression they don't question their gender.
Hey, that's okay! I spent months telling myself ""okay, I'm probably trans, but I don't think I can fully accept that right now."" It took a long time just letting the idea rattle around in my head before I really accepted it.

If you don't feel like you can internalize the idea right now, that is 100% valid. You can go about your day and think ""I might be a woman"" and then reject that idea for as long as you need to get to a place where it feels possible. (Or, you may decide after playing with the idea for a while that it's not quite right. Equally valid!)
The first step in dealing with denial is acknowledging it. Honestly, once you've done that I'm not sure it's still denial.
Amazon helps a lot when you aren't comfortable going out and buying stuff from a brick and mortar store.

YouTube has tutorials on pretty much anything you could ever want
The best ones 👌🏻
Np. And you highlight some of my old thought patterns. Take that as you will. 😉

Good luck to you sweetie.
No. It might, however, be trans *reality*.
The first step for me was coming out to myself. The second step was coming out to my friends and parents.

Still not out at work because my boss is openly pro-Putin which makes me wary of coming out to him. But looking for another job rn where I will hopefully be out.
Yeah this sub has been a big help since I've come to terms with my identity. It also helps to have some friends IRL that you know will be supportive. You don't have to tell them you're trans right away but if you determine they're someone you can trust you can ask them to start using non-gendered terms or feminine terms when talking to you. Such as compliments and pronouns. Let them know you're trying it out and you're not sure where you'll go with your journey but you trust them enough to have them with you on the way
Yeah. To spare you all the long boring details I felt this way for a while before I figured out I was trans. And yeah, I felt like a creep. 
But even if you haven’t had hrt, or surgery, you are still a woman, and there’s nothing wrong with that.
That’s alright! Non binaries and trans masc people are often brushed aside when it comes to trans discourse but they definitely deserve to be seen and feel valid!
A totally cis guy would probably run away from the button, or back away slowly to make sure he doesn't set it off
honestly same, lesbian women just happen to be the prettiest for some unknown reason ^((totally not feeling like a wierdo typing this))
I love youuuuuuuu ijsaldnssaj
thank you, I cant keep hiding for ever, I have to get out there and live life how it has to be lived!
Yeah, that's a biggie for a lot of people, including me.  For a humorous look at it, check out reallifecomics at  https://www.reallifecomics.com/comic.php?comic=june-29-2020 for when the author, Mae Dean, realized she was trans reading that exact line; the comic documents her transition.

And congratulations!  Welcome to the club, sweetie!  😁💜💋💋
[NightlingBug's Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215716433210105856?t=aA89cTzUvRcSL6yW3vmNmg&s=19) also gives some good examples of how suppressed dysphoria feels.
...

(Sexual orientation crisis)

\>.<
If nothing else, you can find bi folk around.
I mean thinking about gay women stuff as the cis guy that I am def feels like fetishizing.  

>You can be a woman if you want to be

I want to but ughhh i dont know. my brain is stupid and i am too.
>And there is no shortage of transfemmes who love other transfemmes.

aww wait a t4t relationship seems like something so cute, one can only dream....
>By self reflection I just mean continue thinking about yourself and what you want and who you are. 

Ah good, I literally cannot stop doing that at all so go me I guess!

>A ton of us here relate extremely, extremely well to the experiences you’re writing about. Just saying.

Well it is kinda strange that over 200 trans people related to my experience as a cis guy.... probably doesnt mean anything ^((it fucking does doesnt it))
what would you think it would be then? fear?
And honestly, the cashiers at the store probably do not give a single fuck (they’re not paid enough to care what you’re buying). And if anyone gives you any crap you can always claim you’re getting a gift for your girlfriend or sister or niece or something.
yeah they definetly do, they are some of the best friends you can get
rlly? being a girl seems perfect
You’re not stupid. Not even remotely. Right now it just sounds like you’re questioning your gender identity. Nothing is wrong with that. I don’t know how long you’ve been thinking about this, but maybe arranging a consultation with a gender therapist could help parse out your thoughts.
>(it fucking does doesnt it)

Yeah girl, it probably does.
Can confirm lol. I wasn't a cashier, but when I worked retail I gave less than zero shits about what people where putting in their carts and mostly just hoped they wouldn't talk to me.
It is if that's what you age. I was in your position a couple of months back, and didn't realise how constantly bad I felt until after presenting as a girl (whatever that means to you: wearing skirts, shaving, using she/her, wearing a padded bra (this is the most for me))
Whenever I see this idk whether to celebrate or break down. It's such a hard time not only coming to terms with all this crazy shit, but deciding embracing it is the only way forward. 

No dream worth pursuing is easily obtained, I suppose.
I know right??? idk if I should feel happy about it or if I should feel pathetic for it... all I know is that its what I want and whether it sucks or not matters but thats other thing
You definitely shouldn’t feel pathetic. All of this is part of the process. 

If it makes you feel better, getting through the denial was by far the hardest part for me. Everything tends to become easier when you finally accept yourself. It’s the constant questioning that was the real torture.
I understand these feelings and still have them sometimes. But sometimes I step out the front door in that skater dress that sways just right, and those heels that make my feet look cute, and I strut with long strides, head up and back straight...like I own the world. 

And most of the time I'm just in my pajamas like ""I'm just here for milk and eggs""
> It’s the constant questioning that was the real torture.

IT REALLY IS!!!!!! my questioning has burnt me out in a way ive never even experienced, I havent experienced a lot of my life yet so that was close to a rock bottom for me.  You never really stop thinking about it at all and it becomes the background music of your head. The background music that midly hurts your ears and plays for days, week, months...

I want to isolate myself and to stop living life how I used to live it and I did that for some months (it wasnt fullfilling) but I have to get the fuck up now. I cant stop living because if I do I will never achieve to be what I want to be.
I feel that. It was so all consuming when I was 11-13 that my brain just eventually shut down and I was in perma-disassociation mode for the next 20 years. Completely lost any sense of who I was. Breaking free from that was the single greatest experience of my life. It was like I had been drowning my entire life without even knowing it, and then I finally got to breathe air for the first time. I’ll never forget that feeling.

Lack of transmasc representation	I'm transfem, so I'm not sure if I'm allowed to have this opinion, but it's sad to see how underrepresented the transmasc community is on Reddit, not just this sub. I don't have a solution, just want to be heard.	"trans guy here hello! and i do agree there’s def less trans men on reddit, but i still gain value hearing ab spectacular trans women’s experiences. thankfully there’s subs specifically for transmasc ppl- and though there may be less of us on here,, it’s still a happy lil community:)
I’ve noticed this more so with just society in general. Us transwomen get loads of representation or just people talking about us and i feel like i never see anything about transmen.
Yeah. Tons of people say that but I doubt it will ever change. Society as a whole just doesn't seem to care much about trans men .
It would be nice to have a more near 50/50 split but im happy for the rep we have.
Im doing my part by upvoting all transmasc content!
Tbh i find that transmascs tend to have to form our own spaces, we get pushed out of previously supportive spaces when we become ""too masculine"". Or talking about our specific experiences with transphobia suddenly prompts us getting talked over by transfems who decide to explain their experiences or make comments about how they would be euphoric if they had the things that give us dysphoria. I dont see the latter so much on reddit as much as i used to, and im glad for that, but the wounds are still there. And im still scared to talk about my experiences around transfems.

But also ngl some transmasc spaces are rough too. Binary trans men seem to take on toxic masculinity a lot and as a nonbinary transmasc it makes me extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome, especially when they say things like ""i hate that nonbinary people dont want to look cis because it makes me feel dysphoric"". My euphoria shouldn't invalidate anyone else and it really makes me feel like im not welcome anywhere unless i hide my gender even in trans spaces. Im definitely not a cutesy frog enby, so being in spaces where non-binary people are infantalized isnt my vibe.
taking this mini post blowup as a chance to give a shoutout to all the social workers out there who actually give a damn
Love and solidarity with all our trans siblings ❤️🖤
Heyo, trans dude here and I agree but I don't want to invalidate trans women either. Often I see trans guys hanging out in the comments of **one** trans guys post tho
I \***so**\* appreciate transmasc persons, and I wish they would be more visible.  I suppose they will as they feel safe (emotionally and physically) being so.
yo trans man here! probably bc to people, we will always be their ""little girls"" lmao
Yeah when i look on here it’s all transfem
Thank you for speaking about this ❤️
I think this has something to do as well with the platform itself (although I do agree society at large has transmasc underrepresented). Reddit is commonly used more by guys than girls, which means transfem eggs are likely to use reddit before cracking, so when they crack they still stick around which leads to more transfems than transmascs.

Just my theory, that's why I also think social media platforms with primarily female audience have more transmascs on them, but again that's just my theory!
Trans man here, ofc you’re allowed to have that opinion. it doesn’t put anyone down, in fact it’s cool to see you guys notice it too. I don’t think it’ll ever be perfect but we try
true that, it's rare that i see people like me out there. in fiction too, it's so hard to find good stories about trans guys. even harder if you're looking for non depressing ones lol
just censor the opinions of all trans women ez women arent allowed to have opinions anyway

&#x200B;

I'm kidding obviously but yeah you're right its really just about the demographics of the site, idk what to do about it either but its a thing
From what I see, there are lots of transfem rep on Reddit-and lots of transmasc rep on tiktok
As a transmasc myself, I agree! I find transfem issues very interesting though, so I don't really think about it tbh :)
I'm just quiet. lol. we are here!
yeah, as a transmasc i definitely see the lack of transmasc rep on reddit specifically, but other apps like tiktok have a higher transmasc rep than reddit
transmasc people usually get more attention on different platforms, reddit has been the only place i've seen trans women represented
You’re not alone in being alone.  While I am MTF, I feel very out-of-touch with the majority line of thinking here - I don’t feel like I fit in.  If I could snap my fingers and be a woman, what a relief it would be to never have to be trans; I’m sure many others would say the same. 

I do find a lot of validation and affirmation within the group, but if I always embraced the popular opinion,  I think I’d end up being too offended and pissed off at the world around me to ever find any happiness.  

Anyhoo, there is good stuff here, and having more diverse representation only makes it better.  Thanks for standing up and being you.
Oh belive me I'm here.

I'm just a lurker. 

Alot of us are probably
Transmasc representation in everything is almost non-existent, and I'm fairly sure everyone feels it in our community. Also, you're allowed to have whatever opinions you want, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
I’m a trans man and it really does seem to stem from the way that gender norms have been created in society. I personally love celebrating everyone’s story, but it seems that an AMAB person acting more “feminine” is seen as more…bold? by the cis, heteronormative society, whereas an idea of “tomboys” is much more “normal” and thus blurs the lines between transmasc AFAB people and cis women who prefer a more masculine look.

It demonstrates a toxicity on both sides, which is why I believe clothing, fashion and style needs to be treated as non-binary as a whole. Clothes have no gender, but society attributes gender definitions to clothing - so an AMAB person wearing a skirt is much more drastic than an AFAB person wearing pants. People should just wear clothes and society should respect people’s identities. 

This was a bit of a rant eeee I’m sorry it’s late at night, I’m just a lil guy with a lot of thoughts haha.
I feel like transmascs will never be well represented as long as transfems continue to treat themselves as ""the norm""

kinda intimidating, especially since a lot of transmascs get creepy dms or comments when talking about dysphoria.
on other social media it’s the opposite (one that rhyme with click clock for example) so i was very surprised when i came here to find all this transfem representation. as a transmasc i’m not really offended by this because we are still welcomed
almost every trans masc i’ve ever met rarely uses social media or the internet in general. a lot of trans girls are online and are very loud about ourselves.
Women are a chatty bunch 🤷‍♀️
Transmasc people do get all the good trans songs though
honestly i think it’s because most people generally can tell if a woman is trans vs if a man is. because even if they can tell…the most that they can say is “you’ll never be a man”.  society is factuated with this idea that being a man comes with certain restrictions which is why i believe ignorant people are so hard on trans women/homosexual men as opposed to trans men/lesbian women. don’t feel bad. the discrimination you guys deal with is sickening to me and no where near as bad as trans men do so you guys deserve every bit of recognition
[removed]
I'm trans masc and yeah, it's underrepresented
Yeaa but all in all there's a lack of trans rep in society which sucks
I agree. Personally I in my day to day life I don't mind it this way because I get about equally as much transmasc as transfemme content but of course it would be cool to see more transmasc peeps in subs like this
I don’t actually agree that there are fewer transmasc people on Reddit. r/mtf has 148k members and r/ftm has 144k members so the numbers are nearly equal. Shared trans spaces are just more frequented by transfemme people so it creates what feels like a big disparity
Remember that society is run by cis people. This is done to perpetuate the trans women are predators myth
my guess is it has something to do with the rampant fetishization of trans women
Growing up I thought trans was only for mtf ... Didn't know females could transition into males... And here I am, transmasc
Because our existence undermines their flawed ideology about transgenderness just being ""men with crossdressing fetishes,"" or ""men trying to invade women's spaces"" so they try to pretend we don't exist in order to not address how that's obviously not factual.
I feel more males use reddit, therefore more transwomen and  sadly some persons harass transmasc because desiring to be male sounds unreasonable to them.







That said i truly believe its a vocal minority i either don't mind or try my best to direct them to more transmasc populated sub reddits
Thank u, I needed this (trans masc Social Worker who gives a damn)
this is true if you see trans hobbies in general. Trans women are more likely, in my experience, to be in traditionally male dominated hobbies like video games, programming, cars, etc. and transmen are more likely to be nurses and artists. These are just what they were pushed toward/introduced to pre transition. ofc these are just what I've seen. I've not been able to find proper stats on trans occupations unfortunately. :<
Transmasc issues are as important though

In any case, i wish you the very best☺️
For some reason Trans fems are more apparent in the world, so transmasc voices are usually drowned down. Although trans fems might have to deal with more harassment since they are more apparent. Also please do not say we act like were the norm
i dont think it's necessarily the individual transfems treating themselves as the norm, but the overpositivity in the transfem space. it can get a bit dangerous if not managed properly, and we can see the effects of it if its not kept in check and we dont look out for our transmasc brothers
true that
You don't *actually* think trans women benefit from the patriarchy, do you?

That was an intentionally outlandish statement for rhetorical purposes, right?

... It was for rhetorical purposes, right?

/Amidala
what a scandalous idea, lets hope this ideology doesn't go mainstream \*nudge nudge wink wink\*
i see i see i didn’t know that! was mostly referring to this sub because i’m on it more but that’s interesting! ty for the info :)
I think whats funny is if we all used our “real bathrooms” you know what i mean, they don’t realize it’s significantly more confusing for children to see women in the mens room and men in the womens room lol.
Also the fact that a lot of transphobic discourse is about the moral panic of allowing ""men"" into women's safe spaces.
It almost certainly does
Me neither. I don’t remember my reaction to finding out though.
Yeah we’re just seen as delusional women who are trying to imitate men and therefore we’re not seen as a threat to them 🙄

(Hey off topic but how did u get that flag under your name)
> I feel more males use reddit, therefore more transwomen

that statement seems rather transphobic on the surface.
I've seen memes where it's blatantly clear transfems just ""forget"" there are transmascs in the space. It was kind of sad when people weren't putting spoiler warnings on the assumption of gender posts.
How am I get downvoted and you are getting upvotes lmao

Go to the subreddit page. Hit the 3 dots at the top. Click add user flair . Choose stuff
My favorite terf rhetoric is that trans men are just women who are trying to escape misogyny and obtain men's rights.

Like, ah yes, I accepted less rights as a trans person so I can have men's rights. I accepted potentially being harassed everyday or worse for being trans just so I can escape harassment... Makes TOTAL sense, right? /s
Right, but it's more like we started using it pretransition and kept using it after
Saying ""both of which are true"" here is kind of like saying that this brick and that feather both have weight.
Oh hey, dialogue! Kinda wasn't really expecting that here =P

My, but we do like our dramatic overreach, don't we? Despite this second example I'm still not completely sure if this is meant to be some kind of hyperbole, if you genuinely believe those statements, or if you're just trolling. (It also makes an interesting contrast with the understatement in the first paragraph, that the patriarchy merely makes for an 'unpleasant situation' for those who don't meet social expectations.)

I'm pretty new to this subreddit and to trans spaces in general, so I can't state categorically that what you're talking about in the second paragraph never happens. The vast majority of what I've seen here and of interactions between folks of all genders has been mutually supportive, kind and accepting. Worst I've seen that comes to mind is some people who plainly mean well but seem to keep missing the memo that offering to trade body parts or making infantilising responses to transmascs who complain about height dysphoria are not actually helpful. So I'm not really sure what oppression or standing on privilege to shut other people down you're referring to there? But whatever you're talking about, I'm pretty confident that saying trans women as a group are as/more oppressive than cis men is a bit over the top.

(Also a note on the topic of cis men, having some degree of privilege under an oppressive system does not equal benefitting from that system, it just means suffering less than some other groups. Overall, most cis people are also harmed by the patriarchy.)

Apparently online game voice chats aren’t safe. Who’d have thought.	"So for some background, I’m a 21 year old trans girl and have been doing voice training for a fair while now. I’ve reached a point where I feel pretty confident in my voice and talk openly whenever. Today I decided to play a game I hadn’t played in over a year called SCP: Containment breach. Now, the thing about this game is that voice chat is a MASSIVELY important part of it. I’d had no prior problems before transitioning, so I didn’t worry about it.

Sadly, it didn’t take long for a guy to start sexually harassing me as soon as he heard me. It was freaky and I ended up stopping playing for a bit to go to my birthday dinner with the rest of my family. I got on again later in the night and things went well for a solid hour until I realized that some people were calling me he and that guy and stuff even after hearing me.

I just… don’t get it. Am I cursed with some sort of androgynous voice that invites sexual harassment AND misgendering? I really thought I was doing well with my voice stuff but right now I just wish I could go mute. It certainly didn’t make my birthday any better."	"I’m sorry for that. The internet in general is so awful at times, video games being the worst for women due to these kids and awful people who like to be toxic just because of the anonymous nature. 

I hope you keep enjoying the nerdiness regardless of what it is. This is why the block voice chat is seen more and more in games. I hope you have a better day. Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

And yeah, the weird validation of getting vote kicked from a game because you were recognized as a girl on voice chat. Also not sure which is worse, people telling me I sound gross, or that I sound hot and asking me personal questions when I'm trying to give callouts in Siege. : |
Some people are just terrible, it sucks. I'm sorry you experienced that. People who act that way aren't a good metric for any measure of yourself or your voice. They aim to offend and they try to hurt. Take care of yourself. Maybe you can find a friendly group on discord, maybe an LGBTQIA+ gamer discord??
Just wanted to say that some of the folks misgendering you *may* have been doing it out of habit - it could be that they're more likely to think you're a kid or a dude with a high pitch voice before they would realize a *girl* might be among them. (How scandalous!) Might be guys who don't wanna offend/provoke another guy by saying they sound girly. Not to defend or endorse that behavior, just trying to say please don't be too hard on yourself about it, I don't think it's a reflection of your voice itself but just of how dumb men on the internet are.
That sounds painful! I don’t really have any advice on how to deal with that. I make no attempts to alter my voice because it scares me to try. So obviously I get misgendered on the phone, which is painful but understandable.

In case you didn’t know and you have the means, there are three different voice feminization surgery options available for trans women. That’s what I want to pursue.
two possibilties:  
1. voice is sus

2. you, like any other woman gets harassed by men in online voice. A cis woman tiktoker playing CoD had a few videos where she got misgendered the whole game and they accused her of being a boy and using a voice changer. She didn't even have a deep voice and that one really opened my eyes.  Men online just harass women.
People suck. And yeah guys can be aggressive and rude. Unfortunately.
I usually  have everyone who I'm friends with in a party but I'm usually just the only one in the party talking to myself lol.
I guess it depends on the community you play with as well, a more hardcore gameplay environment tends to invite people who are less compassionate and understanding (in a nice way to put it).

I’ve been playing FFXIV and I think my voice is hardly passable, but I’ve joined a few random parties and never really had an issue so far. I wouldn’t dare even trying to speak in Apex or Valorant.
I love that game! It doesn’t run well on my laptop though and I tend to just play in extremely small servers (like three other people) with no voice chat just to play a glorified game of hide and seek. It’s fun! I know where you’re coming from though; I play destiny religiously and while voice chat isn’t a major major part of the game, for a lot of modes it is. I haven’t done anything with my voice so I still sound squeaky and girly and have gotten misgendered before even with clanmates :( but for the most part my clan and friends are super awesome and make it worth it, I had horrible calling anxiety before I got into destiny and now I’m still nervous about it but I’ve gotten to the point where I can throw on my headset and hop on with friends without freaking out. It’s great. Anyway, yeah, - sounding feminine at all will get you treated like shit. Don’t listen to them though, I wouldn’t even recommend staying in a server with aholes like that. I’m sorry op
I play a lot of SCP and run into this pretty often too, literally the best measure is just to find other queer SCP players (there's a surprisingly high number of them) and either run private servers or take over empty ones. It sucks but it's all that can really be done
I've played that game, I have a high voice and they were all like ""oh my god is that a girl?"" It wasn't harassment thankfully, but like, yeah.
:( I’m so sorry friend. I know this is a stretch but, if you’re on PS4 and you ever play GTA, I need friends and if anyone talks to you the wrong way I will literally rip them a new a$$h0l3 😂
I’m also a trans woman and I naturally have a deep voice and I can only raise my voice to an /sigh/ cringe alert!! I can change it to only one voice that sounds girly and it’s a anime girl voice I worked on for a year and Yh it doesn’t go well so I just avoid talking and lip things and don’t talk unless I’m with a friend or two and or at home even than I don’t talk much
Thank you dear. Luckily, the game in question let’s you mute people individually pretty easily. I’m just… scared now. As well as anxious about my voice not passing. I’ve lost a fair amount of confidence.
Honestly though! It’s just like… walking on a thin line constantly and worrying you’ll get harassed.
Maybe. I don’t think it had to do with me being trans though. In fact, I don’t think anyone clocked me. The guy who harassed me very firmly seemed to believe I was a girl and was insistent on getting into my pants. The server idea might be good though. Or I just don’t play it…
Yeah dude bro culture is pretty common in games, especially games like SCP with the shooting and the killing and such. I have a transfem friend who is super into gaming culture and she constantly refers to me as ""dude."" It used to bother me but I've just accepted it, its just part of the climate shes in a lot.

Everyone is assumed dude until proven otherwise (and even sometimes after that by right of gamer dude passage). Im sure if OP found a way to bring it up in conversation to correct them they would've switched, but then of course youre back to playing chicken with the first problem.

Someone above said a LGBTQ+ discord server might help and I second it, I love that game (even if its been a bit since I played)!
I suppose that’s true. I just get hyper anxious about these types of things because I want to be viewed as a woman 24/7 and I get scared that if I don’t pass well enough, I’ll get hurt. I’ll try to gently correct in the future and avoid aggressive interactions.
The surgeries are a bit too scary for me to try. I think I just need to try harder with being consistent with my voice. I’m just confused because my voice therapist said that I always sound female.
Wait, WHAT?!?! That’s just paranoia on the guys part at that point. Also, whatcha mean by “voice is sus”?
That’s the thing though. It’s not a competitive game in the slightest. It’s more of just a goof around type of game. And I actually did speak in valorant once while playing with my girlfriend and no one gave me any trouble, so that makes me more confused. I guess it wasn’t ranked though…
Noted. Thank you
It’s weird because I met someone else while playing who sounded EXTREMELY fem, and no one mentioned it. I guess it just depends on who’s on the server?
I play on PC and don’t have GTA, sorry. Thanks for the invite though!
Fwiw hon', a lot of people online - and I mean a *lot* - just assume that everyone is a dude until told otherwise. Especially in games. 

Unless you have THE most unmistakably feminine voice ever, or self-identify openly as soon as you join the chat, some people are gonna hear you and assume you're a younger person or just a guy with a high voice. I have a couple cisfem friends who get misgendered in chat all the time. Something-something patriarchal society. 

I'm sure you're passing just fine. \^^ I mean, goodness' sake... you said yourself that you were getting harassed by some guy earlier in the evening for being a girl, so clearly someone got the right idea. I'm really sorry that happened to you btw 😥 But yeah. If they saw you *and* heard you, I bet it'd be a different story. Some people just don't pick up on gender in voice on vc.
It not an issue. You shouldn’t let them get you down as they are not fair critics of your voice. Shake it off and relax. It’s not easy but you can move passed this and get back to being yourself.
There’s no such thing as “passing” or “not passing” if you consider that you are a woman no matter what voice you have.  It doesn’t matter what your voice sounds like, it IS the voice of a woman because you ARE a woman.  Aiming to feminize is a personal choice, and I’m right there with you with trying to sound more feminine, but do it for you, not for them.  If you need a confidence boost, think of the voice of an old cis woman who has smoked their whole life.  If your voice can sound more feminine than that, you’re doing better than some cis women out there.  Just keep the low end of the range in mind.
I don't play the game, but did you happen to have like a male avatar? Maybe they were talking about the character and not you IF that was the case.
Of course, I just think the odds of running into misogynistic asshats is lower on queer discord lol
Are you sure it was your voice, and not something content-based that made someone catch on, and tell the others?
Definitely luck of the draw. I was even asked my pronouns once, though I felt a little singled out given they didn't ask any of the other deeper voiced folks what their pronouns were. I recommend having pals join you online and that helps keep your head in the fun!
I’ll certainly try. I’ll just have to focus really hard on my voice in the future.
All of the characters in the game are male because of sexism and patriarchy I guess. You get assigned a random class at the start of the game, but all of them are either guys or monsters.
Fair point. Sorry
I don’t think so. No one was referring to me as a gay in any sort of malicious or hateful way and it was only a few of the people on the server. I think they legit just thought I sounded like a guy or maybe a kid?
Smart. That person I mentioned did have a friend with them.
Good luck and have a great day.
No apologies needed! Im sorry you experienced this. You deserved better
Thank you, you too"	wawjp5	trans	295	0.98	2022-07-29 05:44:38
In Defense of UWU culture, or How I learned to stop worrying and embraced the NYA	" 

(trigger warning, for serious discussion of transphobia and transphobic language as well as some language) 

I have noticed on many trans online spaces, some serious scoldy criticism against anime style catgirl/uwu culture that many internet transfemmes treasure and post regularly. I understand the criticisms are obvious and intuitive to many, that a lot of anime culture is problematic and overly sexualised in an often creepy way. However, something within the spirit of uwu, yet lights the hearts of countless trans with a feeling like hope. A feeling not explained in words, and I wish to do my best to serve the catgirl nation, to find those words, to defend the subculture that has proven such a balm to my jaded broken heart. 

I want to start my argument with historical western culture. I want to start with an anecdote referencing trans youtuber May’s amazing video essay on the western 80’s slasher, Sleepaway Camp. The TLDR version, is that it is a profoundly transphobic film, where the final line at the end of the movie, is the “horrific” reveal that the female presenting slasher, has male genitalia, shouting “SHEs a DUDE!” even within the safe context of a trans video essay, this scene was painful to watch. 

The interesting take on this movie, is not pointing out all the many, many ways this movie is offensive, but in the strange way that May, and I as her audience, took strange inspiration from the movie. May projects an interpretation where a kind, innocent and really cute trans girl gets epic violent revenge on “victims” who for the most part, are really abusive and mean to her. It is likely a symptom of how microscopic popular trans representation is, and how DESPERATE us trans are, to find something inspiring in any image that vaguely reminds us of ourselves. Even if the movie is made to be awful to us, May is so jaded, she just wants to find some joy in a cute looking trans character getting revenge on assholes. I relate to that level of cynicism and emotional exhaustion.

Of course, popular western culture has progressed since the 80’s, the president can say “trans rights” and a good looking enough tran can give those particular kind of “inspiring” speeches that suburban white people in auditoriums like. It appears like we might be getting a lick, a slight hint at possible full social acceptance, and with that, comes the temptation to try to fit in with popular society. But, and this is a big but, where is the “positive” trans representation in western culture right now? What TV character embodies someone that a young transfemme today, feels is inspiring and relatable, or dare I even suggest, sexy or cool? 

This is my own anecdotal experience, but the last trans representation I saw in western TV was a chick who got murdered on a cop show, and some family drama where an ugly tran was kind of a bitch (not in a cool way) and caused problems for the main cast. Oh yea, and during Halloween I saw Leprechaun in the Hood where a trans character was brutally murdered as well for laughs. Then there are characters like Nia Nal in supergirl, who are explicit pander characters who make me cringe in a way deeper and grosser than anime ever has. Such characters are examples of pure astroturfing. (for the young uns, astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.) 

Which finally brings me to the main subject of this little manifesto. Anime. anime has a lot of trans representation (compared to the popular west.) Whether its the adventurer girl in “that time I got turned into a spider” or Tanya in “The story of Tanya the Evil” or that noble knight in “Magical Girl Raising Project.” They are written naturally into the stories not to make a political statement, but because the authors, many of which are cis male, felt that such characters served the story they wanted to tell. Sometimes those representations are problematic, often they are overly sexualised. But there IS representation, lots of it, evil characters, good characters, tragic and comedic, from “Stop!! Hibari Kun!” to serious discussion of self harm and suicide in “JJ Macfield and the Ilsand of Memories” (which is a masterpiece as far as I am concerned.) 

In Anime, trans poeple are not just “valid”, or “inspiring” but are as full people as the rest of the cast, and you can find them as heroes villains and everything in  between, you can find them modest or as total uwu sex fiends. As a young tran, you can choose from an actual diverse menu of characters to relate to, something not easily said elsewhere. Hell, here in the west contemporary trans are motivated to stan for the fucking sleepaway camp slasher because representation is literally that scarce and shitty. 

Which takes me back to Sleepaway camp. A lot of people in popular culture, especially outside the circles of well to do proggressive types, cringe at the existence of trans people, even today. Many cis poeple find us disgusting, strange, dangerous, the subjects of horror movies. I want to draw a connection, between the way many of those same bigots turn their noses with disgust and contempt towards overly sexualised anime women, is literally the same reaction they give to depictions of ANY kind of trans women. Because they see trans women as devient sex objects. Please consider how a trans femme might see Felix Argyle, or that anime about the tran who lives in boy mode, but puts on a skirt and makeup when they activate their magic “save the world” smartphone app (and looks cute doing it.) Consider how much their projection is amplified 10 fold when their bullies and political enemies cringe the same way at their fictional heroes as they do against them personally.

Consider the art style itself, how the abstraction and lack of detail in anime faces obscures many of the details that trans feel super inescure about, and that when a tran appears in anime, even problematic representations, like the waitress from Persona or whatever, *they get to look hot*, they get to be attractive and normal looking compared to other girls in anime. Think about how much we trans WANT that. We dont just want to be accepted, but most of us, dont want to rock the stubble and adams apple forever, we want to be conventionally attractive, those anime boobs are #transition goals, and that is both true, deeply emotionally intimate, and not a socially acceptable thing that your #trans ally joe biden can say out loud. 

Which brings me back to western culture, and the nature of our progressive “allies.” Yes, we have allies, and trans rights have improved, but for popular hegemonic society, I think any well lived tran understands how *conditional* that societal acceptance is. The proggressive caucus will accept certain kinds of de-sexualised, de-radicalised politically narrow representation of trans in a way that does not challenge capitalism,gender, or even our place in the society they are willing to give us some seat at the table for. Even then, acceptance and integration in such a culture often means implicitly selling out many of our sisters who are poor, indiginous, neurodivergent, or politically extreme. Popular progressive culture is a place we can survive, as long as we know our place, but it is not a place where we can feel safe.

For so many trans who spend all day, living in the most “presentable” way possible, trying their best to not get fired, or evicted, or be the subject of a cringe youtube clip used as a pretext by bigots to say horrible things to us (AKA Gamestop tran freakout.) So many of us want to a space to stop living in fear, to express our hidden emotions, our hidden desires, the things we feel and think that your mom wouldn't feel comfortable liking on a facebook post. 

Anime culture is a place for social outcasts. For better and for worse, all sorts of people who don't fit in, whether its neo nazis on 4 chan, and yes, young trans femmes, find something relatable in the depiction of an artistic culture that glorifies being an outsider. I think thats important, I think its essential that we have that kind of outsider culture amongst ourselves, at least within the internet for christs sake. 

A tran well versed in our history, must understand the role that Camp has played in queer culture. For those less well read, the camp movement is the ongoing artistic trend in dressing in intentionally gaudy and off putting old looking clothing and over the top makeup in order to challenge society and draw attention to standing out as an individual opposed to what normally looks “good” and “fashionable.” Most of what is recognizable in modern drag culture is derivative of Camp. The point is, that in the darkest most transphobic days of our history, Trans found each other, and inspiration and hope and solidarity in artistic movement of intentionally standing out and causing the normies to cringe. There is a reason that many of us find something inspiring in the famous Babs Johnson clip, “Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat Shit!!!Filth is my politics! Filth is my life! !”

There is something noble in giving a finger to the society which has scorned us to make a point about their hypocrisy. That is important, sacred, meaningful. To me it means, “I will not live or judge myself by your rules fuckers” That kind of subversive inclusivity needs to be a part of our sub culture, or a bunch of atomsied trans are going to spend a lot of time living in terror of never being accepted outside of successfully “passing” not even just as a cis female, but as a socially normative kind of tran. 

Therefore, the fact that uwu culture makes many respectable types cringe, is an essential feature of why it is popular. If we were to as a community, replace it, it must be with a cultural language equally or even more offensive to the same sort of people. We must not become whitewashed. Because lets be absolutely clear that this is the de facto effect of appeals to cut down on the catgirl shit. The racial politics behind such appeals. In lieu of eastern anime style art as a uniter, the popular trans culture will not become inundated with diverse art styles and references to artistics movements from africa or south America. The anime replacement art will be overwhelmingly western, and overwhelmingly white. They may often depict dark skinned characters, but they will overwhelmingly be the proggressive western white persons idea of what a POC trans “should” look like, there will be less sexual creepiness, but there will be a lot less diversity of any kind at all. We all all become fucking Nia from supergirl, who writes Joe Biden speeches and thinks the CIA is cool. That's what such a conversion would ask of us to become. Who relates to that? The anti uwu folks, will claim they value diversity, but to claim the suppression of anime art will do anything  but increase the westernisation and anglocisation of our popular art, is a lie on its face. A delusional claim made in appalling ignorance or malicious bad faith. Honestly, if the only two genders of representation I get to choose from in my subculture are a horny cis japanese guy who thinks chicks with dicks are hot, and some weird journalism major who stans Joe Biden, I find the horny japanese guy way less gross and offensive. I feel less “used” by his theoretical maturbatory fantasies. And honestly, even the horny shit is often way more cool or interesting to watch than Jules from Euphoria. 

Which brings us finally, to the horny shit. To the deeply problematic way that a lot of anime tends to sexualize a certain kind of innocence that comes across as offesnively pedophillic or just plain infantilising to women in general. This accusation cannot be in wholesale denied, after all, Anime is an entire genre of art with  diverse depictions, many of which are just plain indefensibly awful and bad. But it would be a bad faith claim, to say that even the specific parts of anime culture that trans culture has idealised, like Astolfo or Felix Argyle, do not exemplify a certain kind of veneration of cutesy innocence.

Yet, I still would ask this of many western critics. “What is wrong in YOUR culture, where innocense and being cute, is tied so closely and exclusively to concepts of pedophilia or children. Why do western women have to put so much effort into masculinizing themselves and de sexualising themselves to be taken seriously as adults in male dominated fields?” As Natalie Wynn puts it, why do so many college girls take weird pride in dressing modestly, yet still going for a “sexy in a stacy kind of way?” What parts of yourself has your patriarchal culture asked you to suppress to be taken seriously? 

Do we not all want to be cute sometimes? To feel innocent sometimes? To feel sexy sometimes too, to go back and forth, to be both at once? Are not those part of the feminine experience and mood? Yes, I can be serious, and grim, and professional, and androgynous, but must I be such things all of the time? Cant I be a slut if I want? Cant I also be a church girl sometimes without being catcalled or judged? Cant I just be a complete fucking person who feels the full spectrum of human emotions in different contexts times and places? Are you not asking us to lobotomise half our souls, to cut off half the sky of our experience? Cant trans women just at least, suffer and embarass ourselves riding the razor edge of the madona/whore social complex half of cis women have to balance between? Cant the artistic representation of that have cat ears? A creature whose name has become culturally synonymous in the west with female anatomy? Why must trans women always be serious, mature and sexless? I am jaded, I am cynical, I am always presenting in the kind of business casual attire and attitude requested from post grad students. Cant I just give a soft uwu on the internet in a mournful hopeful contemplation of the lost girlhood I never got to experience? Why do I need to keep up the fucking business casual mindset even on the godamm internet? 

Im weird. A neurodivergent communist queer, I dont fit in to most places, but I like fitting in with the culture of people who say uwu to celebrate that they dont fit in the same way. I think its cool anime has some many non gender comforming characters, I like that the characters are cute, I want to look like that kind of, not just a little bit because comparing myself to real life cis women hurts in a way that it doesnt to compare myself to the abstracted drawings.

I think its heroic how the internet catgirls know they cause people to cringe, but are fearless in being seen and heard anywhere, I think its heroic they way they challenge social expectation, I think its heroic that they dare to express their desires to be cute, I think its heroic the way they provide a light beacon for other people who fit in, not even just trans, but other queers and non queer good hearted weirdos as well. I admire the catgirls, at their cringiest, at their most pathetic 100 times more than I can ever admire fucking Nia from Supergirl. And to really draw the ultimatum, those really are the only two options, the only two options with the cultural clout to compete for trans subculture hegemony for whatever that's worth. So I ask all you trans, especially the femmes, to look in your hearts and ask what your feelings are inspired by, what you want and what you want to be. Communist catgirl who makes people uncomfortable, or neoliberal sockpuppet who can speak in public, but can't be seen kissing anyone on TV. 

This is my final point, my takeaways from my lengthy pro catgirl manifesto about television, anime politics and gender. Coming out was hard, I was so ashamed of coming out and being seen as an “ugly girl.” Finding the catgirl shit online, was the moment I realised, “fuck, im not the only one, Im not alone.” I ask you this, without the catgirl shit, in our current culture and moment in 2021, what could you show that sad tran in boy mode to inspire her to be brave enough to be cringe? Not enough to “uwu” un public, but to transition to their friends and family, to show her that causing other people to be uncomfortable with you isn't the end of the world? To show her that being weird and wanting to be cute yet sexy is okay? If we were to vote Tabby the catgirl off our island, who would take her place? Uwu."	"You wrote a whole uwu essay, uwu

Ty for this gem, comrade. Do I have your permission to share this? If I copy paste it, do I credit you as your user or do you have a preferred name? 

Keep spinning. Uwu.
Honestly, as a neuro divergent technically bi, MtF politically unaffiliated, liberal progressive humanist that's obsessed with cuteness and loves cat girls, fox girls, and those cringy bits in anime that makes those people mad, I fully agree with this post, even though some of it did go over my head, I get the gist of it. Honestly uwu and nya culture is adorable and memetacular XD. There's a lot of people who identify with these characters and some even put on similar personas, and in some cases, fursonas. Honestly anime was my doorway into self discovery since my mom was one of the most over protective and controlling people I knew at the time. I didn't even know LGBTQ was a thing before I turned 14 and thought anime was cartoons like Danny phantom. I was such a lame ignorant normie back then doing my best to blend in cause I didn't know what was wrong with me or how best to describe it. Had LGBTQ people had more and better representation in western media I'd have learned what that feeling was far sooner. I had asked my friend if he ever wanted to be a girl and he looked at me taken aback with a surprised what? And I looked away nervous and said nvm it was nothing and left it well alone. I was 10 at the time and still had no clue what it was or why I felt the way I did. And anime helped guide me towards my answers indirectly, took me looking up some crossdressing anime characters and finding theories as to why they are the way they are, as well as anime like kamfer to find myself and discover what transgender was. Though it's a shame it took so long for me to figure things out. Then what lead me to learn about lesbians was Yuri anime and my god is that one of my favorites. Which honestly lead me to at first think I was a trans lesbian.  But I couldn't shake something for a while and I didn't really know how else to explain it. I wasn't attracted to men in any way shape or form, yet I found myself attracted to characters like astolfo, asuramaru, and Felix. Characters whom as you so bluntly stated was basically chicks with dicks.  I honestly have no idea how to describe it without it sounding like a fetish because I'm still very ignorant. 
I don't even know how to make sense of it. It wasn't until I learned of the identity Gynosexual/gynoromantic and another version which is similar that I recently learned of, neptunic. Both of which from my simple understanding are simply an attraction to femininity in general. Which I think more or less fits me. Though is that valid? I have no idea. Honestly to me it just kinda feels like bi with extra steps. Am I just lesbian? Or bi with a strong feminine preference? My journey started thanks to anime, helping me as a guide, and I've been figuring stuff out since then.
Damn... Just got linked here from another post, but... Damn... I want so bad to valiantly embrace my cringiest but most comfortable side of myself as you say here... Just for the sake of feel the most true to myself, even at expenses of other people's opinion... 

I need this, not only written, but put in practice by me... 

Have my free award, my fellow catgirl UωU ✨

Thanks a lot for the inspiration and the emotional rush! :'3

Fucking 🔥🔥🔥
I didn’t know anyone ever thought of cat girl stuff or “uwu” speak that highly. I just thought it was some crap creepy people use. Or what extremely childish people use.
Just wanna say I’m another person that got linked to this several months later and my god thank you for putting this into words so goddamn well, I may not feel exactly the same but this makes me feel extremely seen

Also tho I wanted to share that almost immediately after reading this I scrolled down and saw this post (but crossposted to r/gaysoundsshitposts): https://reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/tzp0sl/anime_irl/

And it immediately made me think back to your essay and like, does this comic feel extremely offensive problematic and out of touch? Yes absolutely, but does the person in it also look incredibly cute and absolutely rock that maid dress and make me wish I looked like that? Also yes absolutely
in the words of max0r, i may be cringe, but that makes me free
I'm not transfem, but live some of the boyness I've never had through strong, cute, honest shonen anime (and video game) characters. And I'm crying as I read this.
UwU is a need on this hostile world. Especially for non-normative folks like us neurodivergent, racialized trans and enbies.
i literally do not have the ability to read all of this

i am so fuxkibgw aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
>astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.

Small point to the overall essay, but this doesn't seem like a very good definition of astroturfing. It's kind of the opposite actually. The point of astroturfing is to make it seem like it's coming from the general public. Astroturfing would be if the subversive movement, coming from the government or marketing itself, pretended that their position was public consensus in the first place. Co-opting a subversive movement, by definition, would be counterproductive because that would mean it's not public consensus. Similarly, if a point of view is being pushed by a show it is by definition not astroturfing because it isn't trying to appear like it's coming from the general public.
i feel so seen i am glad that i am not the only one who wants to be an adorable cat girl >w<. i'm going to keep uwuing and blushing because i love being cute so much >\\\\<

Thank you. I applaud your bravery and confidence

Bingo. I agree, very insensitive. But I also agree that the heart of the comic, the soul of the thing is promoting and idea of acceptance of gender non conformity.
I may be cringe, but that makes me free.
That.

Sorry for the mistake.

Dysphoria from a dream	I’ve never had dysphoria about this before but, I had a dream where I found out I was pregnant and I was happy? Obviously I can’t get pregnant irl cos mtf, but it was weird that I liked it in the dream and when I woke up I was weirdly sad, has this happened to anyone else?	"Yes I get those dreams ever now and again. 😢 It makes me sad that I may not ever have a child by pregnancy. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't have kids or a family adoption is an option.
In India they are trying to do a uterus transplant for a trans woman so maybe carrying a baby one day will be possible for you if that’s what you want 💜
 I once had a dream I was super pregnant (7-8 months) and just living my life.  Holy fuck I was so happy and content; I've had rough dreams before, but never about that. I wanted to die for like the next month straight.
Before I transitioned, I frequently felt sad after waking up from dreams where I was a girl, though not specifically about pregnancy. I did start to feel kinda dysphoric about it when my sister was pregnant, though, which is weird, cause I don’t even really want kids, but somehow the fact that I *can’t* have kids at all is a bit of a sore spot anyway.
Nah i remember one time i had dream where i was girl (i didn't know it was dream , it didn't felt like one ) than sadly i woke up .
Yes but kinda reverse, Im ftm and i had a nightmare about being pregnant and it messed me up for a couple of days after
Yes it’s so upsetting but like others have said adoption is always an option. And who knows what medical breakthroughs will happen in the future
Similar. I’m FTM. Sometimes it’s a yk what kind of dream and I have the genitals that I want to have. Then I wake up and cry 🥲
Yes , I have kids and there are many days where I had dreams about being there mother, but sadly woke up to reality. Life does send very mixed messages
I had a similar dream the other night, I dreamt that I'd just had a baby and was somehow pregnant again. (I'm amab and fluid, so this was jarring). I woke up very sad and dysphoric and just wanting back into the dream.
This rings a bell. I think I had a very similar experience at some point in the past but I can't recall.
Oh, totally. That's what cracked my egg. It was a dream where I had boobs, but yeah, the joy within the dreams, contrasting with the utter desolation and disappointment upon waking up to no-boobs was just an indescribably severe whiplash of feelings.

I had no way to explain why I would have either of those feelings unless I was trans.
Had a dream that my mom went with me shopping for underwear and said no hun you should pick those theyre packing underwear, even of youre not gonna pack it's best to be sure and i woke up not fully knowing it was a dream and when you finally realize it youre just heartbroken
Oof I’ve been there. I’ve had dreams where I’m being my happy lil trans masc self and then waking up to my fucking body like it is screws me over.
I actually have a pal like this. They very much would like to be able to conceive but they have no uterus. They're enby and lean pretty heavily femme. But their deepest desire seems to be that they wanna be pregnant and a lesbian. It's a lot more common than folks might think.
This happened to me this morning bro
I had this dream where my parents woke me up and told me “you’re not a girl, so stop acting like one. And put on some clothes, we’ll be having people over in an hour. And please for the love of god, could you at least stop being gay? Just for today at least?”
I had a dream about breast feeding and I looked into induced lactation. When I had a baby on the way I tried it and I'm very glad I did.
I had a dream before I knew that I was trans that I was a man. The entire dream consisted of me forgetting I had a penis and sitting down to piss.
Adoption or meeting someone with kids.. divorce rates are like 50% so the odds are there you can meet someone
The dream that cemented the fact I was trans for me was I dreamt I had the biological body of a female and I never felt happier or more at peace with myself in my life. Then I woke up :(
Well for me I had a dream when I was a girl and I had really nice long hair and now I enjoy watching videos about hair styles and stuff like that
I woke up crying a sweating like crazy after having a dream where I voluntarily cut all my hair off. I instantly started grabbing and feeling If All my hair was there. I felt completely shook up
Yeah that’s always an option
I’m in the same boat, the fact I can’t have them if I wanted them hurts
I get that a lot, it sucks waking up
Yeah I know that feeling, I've had dreams like that so much that inside my dreams I've started telling myself, ""finally it's happening for real this time!"" Aaaand then I wake up disappointed again.
Those dreams are always too short.

Had a lucid dream once, and got so excited that I could be a girl that it woke me up. Been trying to chase that high ever since.
Same. In my nightmare I ended up walking inside a web (I’m arachnophobic) & I fell down the stairs and started drowning
God this. This dream tortured me for years while I was still repressing things. Still get it from time to time. Still kicks my ass. Not far off starting HRT now though, so hopefully not for much longer!
Yes of course the system makes it hard on us, but it's worth going through what the system has in place if I could provide a family, love to a kid/kids.
I get it. I don't *want* any, and my wife and I had decided over a decade ago if we ever changed our minds we would ABSOLUTELY adopt rather than pass down some of the health issues we have

Even still there's sometimes dysphoria knowing that the *choice* to not have kids isn't really even a choice in the first place. Weirdest dysphoria ever lol
On the plus side, my sister made me the kid’s godmother, and that baby is goddamn adorable. I love him so much.
Yeah the system sucks, hope you get that one day
I hope so too."	vzmt5r	trans	284	0.98	2022-07-15 11:52:57
Sadly my chest and hair are fake (fill up bra and wig) but this is my first full outfit that suits me really well an I just wanted to share it. I might buy some of my own make-up soon :')		"Caitlyn, i love your outfit <3
That skirt is cute and badass!
You look adorable and cuddly and I love your style.
That looks amazing I wish I could pull off a look like that
I think you are hella hot. Just because you haven't had breast augmentation, and your hair isn't long enough for you be comfortable presenting in public, you are still gorgeous. 

Do YOU feel gorgeous? I hope so. My hair is going to take a year to grow out to the point I MIGHT feel comfortable in public. MAYBE,

But if it doesn't work out, I have some great wigs  I wear that other cis women have complimented and believe to be real hair. That's good enough for me. Even if someone thinks I'm a trans woman, that STILL makes me happy.I AM a trans woman.  

I love the woman I have become. More than anything, My out life is always wonderful--sometimes very lonely--but always mine and always authentic. 

I think you look fabulous, girlfriend. I'd always be proud to have you on my arm!!!!
You're truly beautiful, wish i could be cute like you.
Could you just leave the link for that bra?
where did you get that skirt 🥺❤️
Ahhhhh you're so cute omg!
Heckin cute and valid
You are looking hella cute ❤️
Damn girl! Where’d you get that skirt and top??
beautiful 😊😍😊
The wig is good, did you order it online or get it fitted? I'm curious about getting one myself.
Your wonderful !!!
Congrats on the pocket score, and I really like your belt with the skirt too. Hope you have fun exploring make up soon. I think your eyes are a fantastic shape to do all sorts of fun eye makeup things with!
It doesn’t matter if they are fake, you look gorgeous!! 😘🥰😋
You look amazing!!!! I love those clothes, and you look very pretty and cool in them B)
Love that skirt. I also use fillup bra, letting my hair grow out tho, it's still relatively short.
it even has a pocket >:D
I'm sure you can!
i can try to find it, however the bra I got specifically doesn't come with filling so mine has socks
aliexpress :')
aliexpress under teachwear skirt/tops
i ordered this one online, i was just lucky it fit pretty well- there's nothing wrong with getting a wig fitted though ;0
thank you!

Have you ever been so dysphoric that the sound of your own breathing is filling you with rage?	That’s the situation, yep. Did homework for almost a full eight hours, got next to nowhere, got really frustrated, stopped, tried to go to bed because I was tired, insomnia ensues, start to think about how disgusting I find my own body, got mad, kept ruminating, started getting angry about the sound of my own breathing, and now I’m just sitting here stewing in sadness and rage and god damn why the hell do I even try.	"Sorry that you're going through such a hard time. Hang in there 🫂
Update: now I just want to cry and throw up LMAO
Just remember that when we say it gets better, not everything is solved, but rather you won't feel this way, and you'll see why you're still amazing, even when down.

Doesn't mean this isn't tough.

Anyways, cheer up fan, we're here!
Did you get any sleep? Do you feel better? Yes not being able to sleep because BRAIN WON'T SHUT UP is annoying af. But yeah I can relate to feeling so dysphoric that pretty much anything will make it worse
This sometimes. , I'm not going to say that sometimes even just the sound of my thinking doesn't bother me a bit.  If I was having a hard time getting to sleep I feel like my breathing sound definitely wouldn't help especially if it was quiet. 

I feel like having someone else like a person or pet being nearby can help me with this sometimes,  though. Too bad pets are expensive and partners don't always help you. 🧚‍♀️🐈🦙🐕
Omg yes that's where I'm sitting right now
Depression and trying to dissociate through doing homework and keep being focused in anything but your feelings is not okay. 

I can imagine how you feel, aknowledging your own body and hating it all. With time, effort, and good working on your mental and physical health, it will get really better. The present sucks but future will be slowly built towards your own desires, as it belongs to you. 
Take care of your physical and mental health in this painful present, please, you will be able to rock future that way!
Punching walls work good on me.. maybe tou can try

No seriously don't hurt yourself too bad and remember that you you'r beautiful.. and don't you dare say the opposite
Not specifically, but I have felt so dysphoric all I can do is curl in a ball on the floor and try to will my heart to stop. Dysphoria is a bitch
Yes, especially when I’m trying to catch my breath or when I’m crying. I thought it was just me… I hope you’re doing better though, things do get better, I promise
TBH sounds mot like a hormone thing to me. If you are on HRT already maybe you are gettin into the mood swing stuff?
I’m tryin’ thank you
Take this hug of mine, it'll pass
No you’re not alone at all lol.
Not on hormones yet lol
Thank you <3
Well I only know this feeling of me just being angry for any reason, when I forget to take my estrogen in the morning.
Feel better? 🤗
I be getting the mood swings constantly 😞. Better than feeling nothing at all though
Somewhat, I only got like two hours of sleep so my brain is still destroyed but now everything is just nonsensical so at least it’s not self-hating speech repeated over and over.
True that. Thats how it felt for me in the beginning, now I'm years in and my perspectiv has changed so much, that I need to be reminded of how it feels, to remember how I started my journey.
Then more hugs for you! :3 🤗
And for you 😊
Yay thanks :3"	ufthgd	trans	261	0.99	2022-05-01 06:08:59
Realizing you're trans in later years	"Hi everyone! I've been feeling very invalidated and fake recently. All trans people I talk to tell me they knew since they were 3-4 years old and it makes me feel stupid. I recently realized I'm a trans dude. I knew I wasn't cis last year, just not what gender. I do identify as demiboy now and it feels totally right! But I didn't know since I was a child. I had a fairly normal and girly childhood. Ofc, I always played with a guys and loved boy toys and all that, but that doesn't detertime anything. Cis guys can play with dolls and not be trans later you know. I have wished I was a guy instead when I was younger, but I never really explored the thought and just accepted that I was a girl. I'm 21 and I came to the conclusion that I'm a trans guy some months ago actually. Using he/him and a guys name. It feels alright, but there's this thing bugging me. How can I be trans if I didn't know forever? Am I even trans if I just recently knew? What if I'm just, idk, trying out a new thing? Ugh idk. 

So what I'm really asking here is, can anyone who relates or realized they were trans later in life leave a comment about it so I don't feel so alone? I'd love to hear your stories! And please, to you who did know since you were an infant, please don't comment. It makes me feel really sad."	"It's not weird at all. In the rear view mirror I can see that something was different about me. But at the time I didn't think anything of it. I realized I was trans at 27 btw. Don't feel like you have to fit 'the narrative' there's no correct way to be trans, just be you
The people that knew since they were 3 or 4 are probably the minority of our minority. We're all just as trans. I didn't figure it out until I was 35, and that's not nearly the oldest people have been by the time they discovered it. Even in hindsight, I can't find any reason to question my gender until I was 12. From what I've gathered, the actual questioning of your gender tends to happen most commonly from your teens to your mid twenties, so you're about as close to normal as we get.

That feeling of being fake is even more normal for us. It's more of a self-confidence thing than anything. Trans people aren't known for starting with a lot of that, for pretty obvious reasons. It's easy to doubt ourselves when we feel the pressure of so many others doubting us, too. But I don't doubt you. If being a demiboy feels right, then it is right!
I came out three years ago at age 63. I had only realized i was trans a few years before that. My wife threw me out. My siblings and children are totally accepting. My employer has been unbelievably supportive. It was a hard road though.

Im off to Twin cities pride with my daughter. I hope it does not rain.
Some people have personalities where they just do what was handed to them till they realize they didn’t actually want that in the first place. There’s nothing wrong with that. I think it’s especially common if religious or traditional values were heavily forced on you.
I'm 29 and just came to terms with it recently. Nothing wrong with discovering it later in life! :)
I was over 40. I had a Major Depressive Episode (sudden onset of significant Depression), and once I got on antidepressants for several months, suddenly I realized that some background behavior was really significant. The Depression had been interfering with thinking about such matters.
My story is similar to yours, but in childhood I still felt kinda off and I was a ""tomboy"" for all of it. Had boy friends, played in the dirt, played sports, etc. Once puberty hit I got major depression and I didn't know why. Then after high school I decided I must be NB... here we are years later, I officially came out last hear as FtM, at age 25. I'll be 27 next month. Your timeline is your own and there's no right or wrong way to do it. Well, I'd say the only wrong way is denying your true self. I've never been more at peace than when I finally just let myself accept who I am.
Learning about yourself is a lifelong process. Coming out or finding the right words to describe yourself is beautiful any time.

Cheers to you!
I repressed my thoughts and feelings for the better part of a decade through my crappy high school life, my parent's rough divorce, and an extremely toxic and abusive relationship.

We're all at different stages of our journey, and some of us start later in life than others, but that's okay. There's nothing more beautiful than finally embracing yourself. I'm 24 now, and even though I've got a whole history, I feel like my life is just finally starting, and I hope that you love being authentic to you. It's a long road, but we all travel together.
MtF here, it's completely normal I didn't find out until I turned 30. 

Just remember age shouldn't make your happiness invalid. 

I spent years miserable not having any info on trans or gender queer available until I moved out and had access to better information.

Keep going you beautiful person ❤️
I realized when I was 28. Looking back I kind of vaguely knew something was weird around puberty but I would have never have realized it was I am trans at the time. 

If you feel better with a guy's name and he/him pronouns, as someone who is AFAB, then you are Trans. It is also ok if it turns out to just be a thing you are trying but I suspect that is not the case based on the emotions I am seeing in the post.
Lmfao don’t worry dude I realised that I was trans 10 days ago (I’m 16). I didn’t know that I was trans in my early childhood because I didn’t know that transgender was a thing. You are valid :) and we love you <3
I didn't figure it out till last year. I've been out as trans for less than a year. I didn't have the tools or the emotional and mental stability to figure it out earlier. How long you've been able to conceptualize your transness is meaningless. You know you're trans, you want to transition. That's enough. Full stop. You can parse the rest over time. Like, now I can look back and see the blaring neon signs saying I was trans. But I just wasn't equipped for it before. Thanks to a lack of exposure, education, and right wing disinformation. 
You aren't alone. Some of us need more time to get there is all.
I’m 59, and while I always had it in the back of my mind it wasn’t until recently that I realized I had to transition. Best decision ever. While there’s a part of me that wishes I had started earlier, I have a 7 year-old daughter who wouldn’t be here right now if I had transitioned back then, so in hindsight I’m glad I waited.
You are definitely not alone  All I knew was I felt different when I was younger. It took me until my mid 40s to start figuring it out. I'm 52 now and started transitioning this year.
Hi Will, you're not alone! I realized I'm not cis when I was 23. I am now 24 and have the same thoughts of being fake because I didn't know since forever. It really helps seeing others like me. You don't need to have known it since being a child. I think that is a narrative often told to cis people to better understand us.
Hi, this is totally normal. Honestly I’m in the same boat and totally understand. I’m 20 FtM and just recently figured it out. I spent my childhood being considered a tomboy and also played with girls or boys toys. I didn’t always know like a lot of people say they do. I’m just now coming to terms with it and that is ok. Everyone learns and grows at different points in time. We all also have different experiences which bring us to who we are. So you are completely valid and I understand completely.
I didn't realize until I was 31! I'm the happiest and most secure in who I am that I've ever been.
I only realized it myself last year. I'm 25. There's no wrong or to late time to discover things about yourself.
I actually just joined this community to ask questions like this thank you op and those in these comments you guys make me feel safe and valid
I only realized a little before 19 years old, it’s perfectly ok.
I only learned that I was trans last year
I didn't know I was a transfeminine enby until I was 30 but I always knew I wasn't a man
Well I myself was born male and always had interest in women's clothes but was into video games playing sports and the like. I went through a few super whore phases and had way to many girls. As an adult I never was alone. Lived with someone until a few years ago when I can do anything I like. I've tried men when I was younger but as a woman myself I really enjoy the sex. Why more than any woman has ever done for me. Now I'm scared to continue transforming but already have small boobs and want to get E asap
I was 37 when I started to wonder if there was something different about me. It was about my 38th birthday when I had understood that I was nonbinary. 

Since then I’ve occasionally looked back on different aspects of my life, and have wondered about whether some of the ways I thought and acted were indicators of my actual gender identity. Other times I’ve had realisations that were “Holy **** how did I not know?!” But in every case, at the time I either thought I was just as normal as everyone else, or knew I was different but had no idea what the nature of that difference was. 

There are all sorts of possibilities as to why you weren’t aware of your nature before now. From not knowing about the possibilities, to having negative associations with it because of the ideas expressed by people around you, to not wanting to explore the idea for fear of being “different” or an “other”, to just never really being forced to consider it about yourself. (And probably a bunch of other possibilities, along with mixing some or all of the above together.)

That you weren’t aware of it before doesn’t make the realisation now, or you for that matter, any less real or valid. Congratulations on discovering yourself my demi-dude!
I'm 29 and people have heard me say that I've known for 20 years, even though I came out as to this winter.

Long story short, I've always known that I was different. I've always felt out of space and weird. I've always been surrounded by homo/transphobes (though I didn't have vocabulary). They were around before relationships was something in my mind. Needless to say, I knew gays/queers were treated badly before anything. 

What I did know at the time was that being different got you bullied. As I had glasses the first years of my life and being the bookworm I got bullied a lot, hence I pledged myself to fit in. 

Basically I built walls for 10 years and it took me 10 years as an adult to tear them down.

So when I tell people that I've known for 20 years I also tell them that I've been in denial for 20 years.

 My question to you; when did I know I was trans? And does it matter?
Im 39 and if you think that's old, head on over to r/translater
Honestly, 21 isn't ""later in life"". You're fine.
My childhood was a filled with monster high and my little pony and I didn't realize I was trans until just last year
You and me both, hon.

Here's the thing. Being 21 (which isn't even that old, really; you're doing great to have realized it by now), your formative years came before trans issues were a thing that was such a hot topic of discussion within society. Which means that, unless you were some kind of psychology child prodigy who could invent an entire theory of gender dynamics on your own before age 5, that you *never had a chance* to know this at a young age.

I wrote up a whole thing about this recently, so let me just [link you to that](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLater/comments/va8e89/comment/ic26bq8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) rather than type it all up again.

Little kids these days grow up with people around them talking about trans issues. They have a chance, and that's why so many kids these days are speaking up about being trans at those early ages. We didn't have that chance.
35 year old here. Realized my truth about a month ago. Helping raise my child and putting on nail polish with her awakened something in me I didn’t realize was there. Now it has put a lot of my past into perspective. This site helped me a great deal to understand myself/wrap my head around [gender dysphoria](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en). I hope it helps you in the same way it has helped me. It’s never too late to love yourself. You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. Good luck on your journey! I hope it is beautiful.
53 here. Actual realization that I am Enby came last year. Yes, in hindsight there were lots of signs already when I was young, very young. But real realization came last year. Nothing wrong with that… better late than never.
I started to have trans thoughts around 13 or 14 but realized that I was trans years later. You are valid.
Not everyone knows right away something wasn’t right everyone has their own realization when ever and no one should be invalidating you
If it makes u feel better i knew for a while but i never accepted MYSELF bcs i didnt like trans ppl lmao. It still haunts me.
I had no sense of seeing myself as a boy growing up , and the only conception of boyhood I had was people telling me I was one , and I consistently failed to behave like one and got a lot of abuse and violence for it, so I repressed it, and just masked and made myself small to not attract more brutalisation.

I did not have any idea I was trans when really young because I had no idea it was a thing, and while trans women are highly visible in India, in public understanding, it gets collapsed with being intersex. My egg did not crack until I was 31. I'm now two years into transition and will be done in the next three. Also I was super dysphoric starting at puberty (11-12) , but I also had a lot going on in terms of trauma so it took me a long time to peel the layers off and rule out alternative explanations for my dysphoria. 

You cannot expect everyone to know when there is such denial of information and stigma that does not give us the tools to know. Be kind to yourself here.
As a mum of two trans children (both mtf), neither really figured it out until they were older. E was 18  and T was 17. All the other parents we have interacted with said their children knew from a young age. Mine didn't, but I think the fact that I never cared about gender roles/stereotypes probably helped or hindered them. So hard to tell! Big mum hugs to you. I wish you much joy.
 I'm 15 and just realized in February last year (14)
I’m 34 and started transitioning at 33
If it makes you feel better, I only found out I was a trans woman last year at the age of 31! It took a severe life crisis to get to a point where I was finally able to be brutally honest with myself. I really did not know before, I only used to phantasize about being a girl/woman since the age of 8 or so - but never made I the connection that this is not just a weird fantasy or fetish. I even judged myself for having these thoughts.

But last year it finally clicked. A lot of trans folks didn't realize they were trans until a very special moment in their lives that made them question their entire existence up until that point. It's normal, I know so many trans people where it has been like that too. Don't let douchebags tell you otherwise - trans or not!
I didn’t realize I was trans until I was 37. Contrary to the perception, realizing it at a young age is a fairly new thing due to growing awareness and acceptance.

This is a good thing, but their are still plenty of people that didn’t figure out until they were in their 20’s, 30’s, or even 40’s.
I didn't figure it out until adulthood when I found out that trans was a thing. When I questioned it in childhood I got the typical Kindergarten cop response which was the norm in my generation of adults and was happy with that at the time.
I absolutely relate!! Thank you for posting this because it's really validating for me.

I'm 27 mtf trans nonbinary and I didn't have a clue till late last year! I've always felt non-gender-y my whole life but as with most people I was expected to act certain ways so I just went with it. After almost a decade of adult living I finally realized what was making me so so sad. I tried on girl clothes for the first time around august and felt real joy for the first time.

We didn't have any good trans representation or meaningful conversations about gender growing up, so gender transition didn't even occur to me as possible until I made friends with queer folks and started following trans people on social media.

You're absolutely valid in your experience. I think we tend to romanticize the ""knew since young age"" experience because it seems more valid than your and my ""lightbulb"" moment, but they're both equally part of the trans experience.

You're amazing and you made my day tons better with your post. 😊😊😊
Figured it out a couple of years ago. Some of us are slower 😅
You’re not alone! Awareness can emerge slowly, and acknowledgement of that awareness can come later still. Before I talk about my awareness of being trans, let me give another example.

As it turns out, I’m autistic. I started to understand I was different as a teenager, but I struggled to grasp in what way. I felt alien, because seemingly no one around me was like me. It wasn’t until I was 19 that I stumbled upon a website with a long list of traits associated with Asperger's syndrome which described me exactly, that I finally had a framework to understand myself. Sometimes, it takes a while before we are confronted with the information we need to finally make sense of our experiences. This is not unique to autism, or indeed being trans.

As for my trans experience, I started having fantasies about being a woman since I was around 8. I started really struggling with my gender in my teens, but I suppressed it as much as I could. From age 15 to 19 I had a girlfriend, and I was to embarrassed to tell her I wish I were a woman. I don’t think I even knew of the possibility of transitioning in my teens. It wasn’t really part of the public sphere as it is today.

It wasn’t until my girlfriend broke up with me when I was 19, that I could finally acknowledge I was trans, and started exploring my femininity and started crossdressing. I watched a myriad of documentaries about trans people, and at age 22 I finally came out to my parents, and started pursuing hormone treatment. It took another decade before I finally transitioned, but that’s another story.

We all take our own paths in terms of awareness, acknowledgement, and self-identification. That’s okay. It depends on so many factors, both intrinsic and environmental. My parents saw signs of my being trans early on, but misattributed those signs. For instance, for a while, my mother thought I might be or turn out gay. Had my parents been more aware of trans people at the time, they might have been able to help me understand myself better earlier on. And the same is true for my autism.

But we all come to a better understanding of ourselves eventually. It can be frustrating to arrive at that understanding so late. I have been through a grieving process myself about not having been able to transition in my teens. But to be fair, I don’t think I would have been ready for it then. We all do it in our own time. It’s okay.
It not uncommon to come out later, but looking back it just obvious you did many tran things.  More I(mtf) really came out to just a bit ago so 27-28, just around my birthday.  But I think I realized um maybe 12,14, but I thought back then 'oh but it a stupid idea but maybe later.  I guess I just never wanted to really accept it and just tried to ignore it.  Okay not really trans back then, I had no clear idea what transgender meant just thought literally turn to woman with no thought on the process or anything else around it meant.  Also for childhood it was practically non-binary, like a girl couldve had the same exact one.  I think I did a great subconscious job of keeping dysphoria at bay for a long long time.

Might have known since I was younger, but only really accepted and truly broke out at 28.  Your making me feel old as dust rather >.>
Check out r/translater
22 when I realized. I always knew I was oblivious, just not how much... 

But r/TransLater is full of people who didn't realize till far later.
I realized it at 43.
Oh honey, you're not alone. I thought that I was cishet man until I was in my 30's (for reference, I am very flamboyant pan transwoman). Sure, were there... signs. Yeah. Yeah there were. But I didn't see them even if other people did. Everyone comes to their transness differently. Some people know from a young age, but many don't know until much later. 

Society does not make space for trans folks and so we often can't see ourselves until we a much older. That is not a reflection of you, that is a reflection of the world around you. You just be you, go ahead and try to figure things out or be confident that you already have, it doesn't matter. You are you. You are valid. You can change. You can stay the same.

Just focus on loving yourself and fuck the haters.
I'm a trans woman that didn't consciously realize that's who I am until I was 47. I've been transitioning for 1.5 years now & I'm absolutely positive this is who I am.

I feel like the stories of people realizing from a young age being so predominant is part of what made it so difficult for me to realize this is who I am.
I just realized it in my mid-30's. I always knew that I had a complicated and problematic relationship to my gender. But I had no idea what gender dysphoria was, or that I was experiencing gender dysphoria. I had no idea that being trans was related to that at all. I wish I had known 20 years ago. :-(
For me and what I assume of AMABs, when we grew up, everything potentially gay, f---y, or queer was pointed out, harped on, and told that we shouldn't be ""that way.

I'm not certain on the AFAB side, \*Except for the acting and looking mannish part\* if that's the same. Because every cis woman tells me often about how they were a tomboy growing up and definitely not trans.
Realized at 36. You’re never too old to question yourself and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
I didn’t know I was trans until I was 14 and didn’t come out and start T until I was 22. Everyone goes at a different pace. Don’t beat yourself up. There are people who don’t realize they’re trans until their 60s or later, no one is more or less valid for finding out they’re trans regardless of age.
I didn't figure it out til 28. Way I see it, I was told I was a boy from birth, and I endeavored to be the best boy I could be. No one ever told me I could be a girl if I wanted to be. I was jealous of girls in some ways, but I never ever imagined I could be one. And then, once I found out it was an option, I had to convince myself that it was valid, and then I had to do research on what it means to be trans. So yeah, it makes sense that I didn't figure it out for nearly 30 years.

You're fine. You're valid. Some people just don't figure it out til later in life. Some people don't figure it out til they're like 60. Don't even trip dawg.
I’m 28 AMAB and just realized that I’m either a girl or gender-queer or something. Been feeling a lot of the same stuff. Idk what to tell you, but like I wanted to let you know you have a whole community of people out here who love you and support you.
Ok hon, I’m gonna lay it out for you the way I see it. I’m an AMAB trans female. I have only recently started HRT and am 55yrs old. My story mostly starts around the age of 13. There were the previous years where everywhere I turned, I was picked on made fun of, bullied and called a fag, queer, etc, which made no sense to me, because I liked girls, and ONLY girls. Around the time I hit puberty all the normal things that happen to a boy at puberty happened, body hair, erections when the wind blew wrong etc. I was ALWAYS uncomfortable with these things. I began tucking to some extent after my first public erection. Around 13 or 14, I began wishing I was a girl, had been born a girl, could change my sex, etc, but I was born a boy. I had the pecker between my legs to prove it. I would put on old lingerie that my mother hadn’t seen or worn in years, that I had found in a box in the garage. I even went as far as anal play and exploration when I masturbated. I didn’t like boys as anything other than friends, but damn I liked the feel of being penetrated. I REALLY liked girls though. which makes me a heterosexual male, right? If you take away the enjoyment of those things, and wishing I was a girl, yeah. I was brought up in a VERY conservative Mormon family. I thought I was an f’ing deviant, and an aberration, so I tried to bury it. Sometimes I was even successful for a while. I did my damnedest to be a normal guy. When the urges would come to surface, I would indulge til I was overridden with disgust and self loathing again, and I’d bury it deep. In the process I developed a very sting homophobic and transphobic streak. The homophobic part was easiest to overcome when I developed friendships with some folk that I later found out to be gay. The transphobic part, not so much, after all, why should they get to do what I couldn’t. I didn’t even recognize it like that for years. I just thought they were mentally ill, or deviants, or extremely queer. The last 2 were honestly the same thing in my book, because of level of extremes. I was in denial and didn’t even realize it. I’ve been married twice, and divorced twice. Part of the undertones of both divorces were not being manly enough. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get it right. It has only been within the last year that my egg cracked, and I came to the realization of what and who I truly am. I started HRT 2 weeks ago. 

All this being said, my sweet boy, coming to the realization that you’re a trans male at 21 isn’t anywhere near “later in life”. Darlin, if this is what you truly want, take the bull by the horns and swing your proverbial dick. God knows every other boy in town does. Just don’t become that toxic male that most cis men are please. There are enough of them already. Everyone that says they “KNEW” when they were 3 or 4 is completely full of shit. At 3 or 4 kids barely even understand that boys and girls have different plumbing, much less understand the difference in gender roles. They just make the narrative to explain to cis people that they have ALWAYS been this way. That they have always been different from cis gendered folk. You’re going to be just fine honey. Just be the very best version of your authentic self that you can be. Good luck. 

Robin
I'm 61 and started transitioning in my late 40's, but have been homeless soon after I started, so I'm not always able to afford hormone supplements. I just take them when I can afford to get them. Hope to be passable some day
I'm a little bit younger than you, but I relate quite a bit! 

I started to try and figure out my gender at 11, and then I was told by my girlfriend at the time that I wasn't trans and I was cis because of her own beliefs on it. She used the fact that I didn't know since I was able to think as proof I wasn't trans, which negatively affected my views in my own gender as I thought that I needed to know since I was a toddler. I repressed a lot of my thoughts and was incredibly unhappy, but I knew subconsciously that I was different to my peers in relation to my gender. 

I held that for a while until I let myself think about at 15, and now 17 I find that I'm 100% trans like I thought I might be when I was 11. It took a while to unpack those thoughts of having to know when I was way younger, but eventually I overcame them! But it still feels like I only recently discovered this as I only recently allowed myself to think of myself as a man. 

It doesn't matter when you find out, at all, in contrast to some people's beliefs. The viewpoint of every trans person knowing since they were born is hurtful to those who find out later as every trans person has different experiences. For those that did know since forever, I'm glad that they've always known. I also feel like people who figure it out in their teens or their adulthood should also get more representation, especially because I feel a lot of acceptance from cis people rely on the stereotype that every trans person has known they were trans forever which is extremely misinformed.  

You're not alone! You're experience will be different from other trans people as everyone's experience with gender is different! There is no 'right way' to be trans and no 'right age' to find out! 

I hope you have a lovely day!!!
I didn’t realize or admit to myself that I wasn’t cis until 39… you don’t always know or realize what the feelings are until you’ve had a chance to look, understand and Identify them.
Most people I see didn’t know when they were that young. I found out last year when I was 16, but I’ve heard of people coming out as trans in their 50s and beyond. It doesn’t matter when you found out, you’re still valid. You should just do what makes you happy.
I had some \~vague inkling\~ that I shouldn't grow up to be a woman and wasn't a girl when I entered puberty, but back then I didn't know trans people existed, that transitioning was possible, and kinda shrugged it off as being an oddball -- as far as I was aware, there was no point in looking for info on 'being a girl who wants to be a boy' because it was, like, fiction territory.

It took me years of realizing trans people exist to realise I was trans, and I didn't find out I was a guy until I was on testosterone for a few months (I think I was 25 at the time).

We don't always know and that's fine. I think there's a wide variety of trans people who didn't realise anything until they entered puberty or were adults.
Late bloomer here. I feel insecure for this reason too. You're not alone.
I was 33 when I first felt that euphoria. I feel like I can look back and see the breadcrumbs, like yea you're trans 🤷🎉
I figured out I'm trans when I was 31, didn't start transitioning till I was 32. Looking back there where signs, but my family and I didn't pick up on them at all. 
Honestly it was reading a thread someone made explaining what dysphoria feels like that made things click for me. lmao I went into it thinking ""Wow, I know a couple trans people. I'll read this to understand it better so I can be a better ally!"" Didn't know that I'd been dealing with it since the fourth grade.
I only realized that I was trans around when I was 25 so don't think you figured it out too late! I wish you the best of luck with your future endeavors!
i didn’t really question anything until i met a trans person irl in my late teens
I didn’t even think about it until I realized. Like it makes so much sense now but at the time I felt fake because there wasn’t any signs. (Oh boy there was signs) I just hadn’t seen them yet
You're not alone. 
I am 31 and starting hrt in August. I realised nearly two years ago I wasn't comfortable with myself but did know why. When my wife asked for a third time ""are you sure you're not trans"" everything just suddenly clicked. And I got a new perspective on my previous years. Always being corrrected for being femine, for the way I sat, (by a photographer) the way I walked (by American football teammates) That I have always found clothing and fashion boring (unless I was buying for my wife) Always identifying as a lesbian trapped in a man's body. 
So you may feel dumb but we're just indoctrinated into a transphobic society.
I realized/admitted it to myself at 36.
from what i’ve seen most people who “knew at a very young age” was part of one of two situations. one possibility is that they had restrictive situations growing up where they were basically forced to “act like” their gender assigned at birth. they’re parents maybe made them wear certain clothes and if they were uncomfortable their parents doubled down. they were told to “act lady like” or “be a gentlemen” all the time which gave them feelings of dysphoria very young. the other situation is that they learned about being gender non informing very young and their parents were pretty open to the concept. maybe people at school spoke about it or they learned a lot on the internet about it so they knew and their parents were also progressive and handled their gender nonconformity well and allowed them the freedom to recognize their gender properly very young. 

for me, i was 18 when i realized because my parents basically raised me pretty gender neutral. my mom encouraged me to “dress like a girl” but when i told my parents i hate dresses and earrings they bought me more masc clothing without making it about gender. they were fine with me playing lots of sports. they didn’t force gender roles onto me but i also wasn’t that informed about what being trans was so by the time i even found out what that was i was convinced it couldn’t possibly apply to me. i always thought “if that was me i would’ve known by now” and pushed away my discomfort with my body and my desire to look like my cis guy friends. 

it sounds like you also grew up with fairly loose gender roles, so it’s possible because you weren’t forced in one direction or actively accepted in the other you just landed in a spot where you just pushed those signs away.
Although dysphoria for me started at puberty, I didn’t fully realize that I genuinely am trans until four months ago; just before I turned 32. I talk about my timeline of self-discovery [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/tosozx/when_did_my_egg_crack/).
Posts like these are always so reassuring to me. I'm basically in the same boat: same age, similar childhood experiences, same recent discovery, and same imposter syndrome - just swap afab for amab.

Everything you wrote is perfectly valid, which to me feels obvious as some rando reading this, but we always seem to hold our own thoughts under an arbitrarily higher level of scrutiny. I certainly do, at least haha
I wasn't aware being trans was a thing for most of my life. I was feeling discomfort about my body, and I didn't like being me especially when it revolved about gender. I just brushed it up to being depressed, and stuff... And then I got into an argument with a member of my very religiously fanatic family. And I was like well if I am going to stand for people I better learn about their issues. And I started reading and it was like a smack over my face... I was at denial at first and slowly I got to the point where I am now and I can not only accept myself for who I am. But I also am able to emphasize with people in homophobic/transphobic places like mine where they might repress themselves causing them mental issues, just because the information about it is obscured and shamed upon by bigots who don't even want to know better.
21 is super young, eventually you'll have more adult friends and the things teens say will just give you a chuckle.

It took me two years of living with a trans woman and being jealous that she ""got to"" transition but ""I couldn't because I'm not trans."" When I finally came out she was like, ""oh thank fuck, finally.""

I had a heavy depression settle in when I started puberty around 11 years old and and it only briefly got better, until I got on hormones and changed my name. I'm still struggling with some things, but so much better than before. My life was like a plane in a holding pattern for more than a decade but now I'm actually ALIVE.   


The reason so many people insist they knew since they were kids is in part that some of them did, but others just say that so they can access care in places where you can't get hormones without fitting ""The Narrative."" Don't worry about it. Life is complex don't get too into labels or definitions, just roll with it.
So I'm very new to this world and looking to learn and make friends. If anyone will teach me I have so many questions. Dm me if you want.
I had not realized I was trans until I was 18, some people don't learn to significantly later in life than me as well.

Just because someone figured it out earlier or later doesn't make them any less valid.
I didn’t start putting two and two together until I was in my mid 40’s. Looking back, I see signs that maybe there was something there, but in the 70’s and 80’s we didn’t have the vocabulary for that in a small town in Texas. You were a boy or you were a girl. 

Regardless of where you’re coming from or when you realized, I’m glad you made it to where you are now. I wish I had known at your age, so don’t sell yourself short. I think, like it was said before, the people that KNOW from childhood are the minority in a group of minorities.
I was in my mid-twenties when I realized I was a trans guy. I'm 27, and still not even a year on T yet. And even when I did realize, I still took a year to 'step back', think everything through, and make sure that living the rest of my life as a trans guy would be better than living the rest of my life pretending to be a cis woman. Since I'm now on T, I think it's obvious what conclusion I came to.   
Looking back, I 'always knew' I was a boy. Or at least, I always knew I WANTED to be a boy. I always knew I was disappointed I wasn't. I always knew that I hated how feminine puberty made me look and feel. In hindsight, it's obvious. In the moment, especially when I was ignorant of the options, it's less clear.   
Growing up, you kinda have to trust and rely on others. Don't touch this, it's hot. Don't do this, you could get hurt. Don't say this, it's wrong. Etc. You have to trust people older than you as a kid, because you don't have any other options. And as you grow older, you still have to at least try and conform to society unless you want to be an outcast. That's getting a bit better now, but it still sucks. Don't worry about not realizing earlier. Maybe you didn't have the information needed to know that being a trans guy was even a possibility. Maybe you didn't feel comfortable in exploring yourself at that time. Maybe you were comfortable with yourself outside being put into gendered boxes at the time, and didn't feel the need to explore further. Lot's of reasons to have not figured it out earlier, just like it's also completely fine for those who did.
Figured myself out at 52. Starter HRT four months later.
I didn't crack my egg til 37.

Hindsight is 20-20 of course and I can look back at things now and be all ""yeah... that's not something cis people do."" Like how when I was 9, I refused to stand up to pee for a whole summer cause I didn't like it. Not a cis person thought. But I was 9 in 1991. I had no context for this. I didn't have the words to figure out my own shit.

Even when I did, I remember in my 20s specifically thinking ""I'm not attracted to dudes so I can't be trans."" Duh, past me, lesbians exist.

Sometimes it's a process to figure our yourself for whatever reason. It's hard to not have regrets, but gotta push forward.
39 here, won't bore you with my story which is pretty similar to yours. But consider that gravity was only fully thought through and 'discovered' until the 17th century... Hello?

Gravity be like.. I knew like 3-4 billion years ago...
Yeah, I didn't even know transgender existed until about 2 years ago, and I realized all of the signs previously in my life that I was trans
I’m transfemme & had no idea until I was 18! Looking back, some things were really obvious but nothing like “omg I played with dolls and wore dresses as a kid” obvious. 

A lot of us were raised in an environment where we didn’t know trans people existed. You’re incredibly valid and I hope you find the answers cause this stuff is hard and takes a lot of reflection.
honestly ""the narrative"" is exactly what made it take so long for me to fully realise I'm trans.

my definition of what it means to be trans was completely skewed because the only stories I'd heard were about trans people who had been hyper aware of the fact since they were 4-5 years old.

those people are completely valid in sharing their stories of course, but I wish I could've known sooner that it doesn't always manifest (or at least isn't always obvious) that early on
I've just realised and I'm 27. Maybe we should start a new 27 club, much more positive than the current one tbf!
Word!
Totally agree with all of this. Realized at 39, and even with that I still don't see a ton of signs from when I was younger. 

Heck, I even have confidence before and after realizing, it was just an extra piece of self knowledge. But it also comes with the standard imposter syndrome, especially as I had no issues with myself, so the idea of changing feels really weird.
I'm glad you finally found it out! And also very good that your siblings and children are accepting. I hope the pride turns out great!
\^\^ This is me. I'm a very passive person. Trying to come into my own now, forging my own path instead of the one of least resistance and doing what I was told without complaint is scary but also liberating.

I'm 34 and a newly cracked egg. You're just a baby to me at 21; wish I'd been that self-aware and brave back then.
This is exactly how I was my entire childhood. I kinda just went through life doing stuff that I was ""supposed to do"". Once in a while, I would have these thoughts that I would have rather been born a girl, but never gave them too much thought. Now, knowing that I'm trans, it feels kind of obvious thinking back on it.
I mean not even religious values, was definitely felt forced into traditional values of “must be a woman, must marry a man, must have kids”. At the time I summed it up to not wanting to be a traditional wife and felt uncomfortable about that prospect, took a lot of self-exploration, fear and acceptance to realise I was trans.

That’s even with pretty progressive and accepting parent
I finally put it together at 28, and I just came out two months ago. I am 30 now sorry
Wait. That makes so much sense. The same thing happened to me kinda? I've been severely depressed for ages and I tried antidepressants some months ago and I got so much better btw. And I realized I was trans around then? So yeah
Actually same. I was sort of a tomboy myself. And I played football with the guys all the time. I actually kind of miss it ngl. I also thought I was enby, but it didn't feel right at all.
Ah! Congrats on figuring it out recently! And thank you
Well, I've always known that I wasn't like the people around me. I always felt a little different, but I never knew why or how. So I kinda just shoved it away and thought ""oh well, guess I'm the weird kid then"". But I think there was always something building up inside
That's not what i meant. I just meant finding out later and not when you're a child.
Haha same here. Though monster high and my little pont was amazing lool.
Well, congrats on realizing recently! Good luck to you too <3
I actually think I did too, but I obviously didn't know that was *trans thoughts*
I think I had the same issue. I'm ashamed of myself for being bigoted, but obviously it's not like that anymore
I'm super happy I could make your day💛💛 thank you for sharing!
That's exactly what happened to me too!!
I've been away from the people I'm used to for a few months now and seeing stories like this makes me glad for this distance because I feel valid and think when I go back home I'll start exploring who I am more the more I think the more I feel Emma isn't just a character that I use for video games but maybe she is a reflection of who I really am
There are, of course, people who claim that ""really"" what happened was that the antidepressants ""changed my personality"". That hypothesis does not explain why, before antidepressants, I spent so much time ""shopping for my partner"", trying things on ""to make sure that they would look right on her"".
This is similar to what happened with me. I'd started questioning in my early 30s just before I got started on anxiety meds, but I didn't let myself think about it much until afterward. There were definitely some earlier signs, but I had no idea what they meant at the time.
Yeah kid, sounds like you're just like me. It took some soul searching for me to really figure it out but you're not that far behind me. I went through some painful years of thinking something was wrong with me but ultimately, it was just ""surprise! It's a boy!""
Yes same, im proud of u tho!
I discovered who I was by writing a character who seemed to come from nowhere, until I realized he was the man I wanted to be. Don't give up.

a semi-detailed story of what my girlfriend and I did when she came over these last 2 days.	"So the past 2 days, my girlfriend (18MtF) visited me (also 18MtF) and we did a lot of fun things.

She arrived on Sunday at noon by train and I went to pick her up at the train station. It was really hot outside so I had to hide behind a cabin where people can sit and wait for the train. When she arrived, I ran towards her and jumped into her arms as she had said that she would like this. We walked home and when we arrived we went to my room and played video games together. After that, we went to lay in bed and we cuddled and kissed. At about 19.00 my mom called us to come eat and we ate burgers, and they were very tasty. When dinner had finished, we said our goodnights and went to my room again. We repeated the cuddling and kissing and we eventually just fell asleep in my tiny bed that can barely fit me, let alone me and my girlfriend, who is way taller than me.

The next morning, I had to get up early to get help studying from some old man who taught physics because in august, I have to redo my exam. My girlfriend stayed in bed and I had to suffer. An hour later, I came back into my room and I tried to sleep a little more because you know we didn’t sleep for shit. At about noon, we went downstairs to eat something and to prepare for a visit to a nearby city to get bubble tea. We went to the city, got the bubble tea, and then stayed for a couple hours longer because we wanted to buy cute clothes. My girlfriend told me she was really awkward in the women’s section but I helped her get through it without much issues. We got her a cute skirt with flowers on it, and also a crop top to go with the skirt. We also got matching bracelets and they look a little like the lesbian flag which is pretty epic, I think. When we got home, she immediately changed into the new clothes and she felt really good. What I saw was pure gender euphoria and it was contagious, because I was really happy for her. And, to make things even better, my sister donated some old clothes to me because they were too small for her and we both looked through it and we found some cool clothes. My girlfriend found a really cute dress with flowers on it and some shorts she liked. I didn’t find anything I liked but that’s okay. After this all passed we ate dinner again and went to bed.

In bed, my girlfriend told me a lot of cute things, she told me about her plans for the future, that she wanted to be a stay-at-home wife for me and that when I would come home from my job, she’d have hot chocolate milk ready for me and that we would have a dog and a cat and it seemed so perfect to me. We then tried to sleep but allegedly, I made it really difficult for her as I claimed more of my tiny bed than I should have. I also woke up a few times from a bad dream, or at least, that’s what my girlfriend says. She also wrote me a poem which she sent me on discord:

>one day this  
one day that  
i'm tired of dreaming  
you're here  
right here  
and i have to ask  
will you...  
be mine?  
be mine forever  
please, my beautiful girl

She also wrote me another poem:

>ahhh 2am  
unable to sleep  
writing a shitty ""poem""  
the light's on  
i'm wide awake  
she's pressing against me  
i have zero space  
tho i do like feeling her body  
pressing against mine

Next morning (today), we woke up at around 11.30 and we ate cereal and then prepared to go to the train station to put her on her train home. We eventually left my house and we walked to the train station. We arrived a little early, so we sat down and hugged. When the train eventually arrived, we hugged and kissed goodbye and she left.

Obviously I’m sad now because she isn’t here anymore but it’s okay because according to my calculations, she’ll be back by next week or so.

So yeah, this was a semi-detailed story of what my girlfriend and I did when she came over these last 2 days.

Anger	"Last year I discovered that I'm trans. I didn't know about the harassment, discrimination, exclusion and violence towards us, so it was quite shocking when I found out about it. I was sad, hopeless and I didn't defend myself when I decided to come out to my family. 
However, these last 3 months I started to feel anger instead of sadness, indignation instead of anxiety and it's pushing me towards defend myself and act, tell people MY pronouns or correct them when they missgender me, show my indignation when I see some injustice happen to one of our trans folks. I don't know if anyone else relates to these changes in their feelings, but it'd be nice to know that I'm not the only one going through this.

Love you all 🏳️‍⚧️💖🌹"	"Honestly, same kinda.

I used to have loads of patience for it all. Tried talking things through with people for years, always hoping they'd see my side of things.

Didn't work. Now I'm angry.

I still give people the benefit of the doubt, and if they seem receptive to learning, I'll give them a lot of time and leeway. But if someone starts arguing with me about it, they can bite me and choke on it.
I try not to be antagonistic toward cis folks. I don't think the majority of them are ill-intentioned. With family and friends it can be different, because sometimes they think your gender expression is a reflection on them. So they may say more hurtful things. But most cis strangers are live and let live types. Maybe I'm wrong.

😊
Love to see the power arc! We fight for our siblings who haven't yet found their voice. Keep up the good fight fren, there are many who appreciate it 💖
Yep, I’ve never had much sadness do I went straight to being angry at the fuckers
I say correct them, but be nice at first. There are people with oppositional defiance that feel like if you are coming at them hard they will refuse to be compliant at all. If they still refuse then by all means tear into them. I know it sucks always having to be the nice person and the one taking all the shit, but acceptance of us is growing each year. Things are getting better.
I needed this. I'm building towards coming out to a person who is definitely not supportive.
I absolutely agree. I was a mild person before I came out and I’d like to think I’m still very level headed, but I never get more angry than I do when I see/hear transphobia, directed at me or otherwise. You’re not alone, and I’m glad you’re standing up for yourself :)
I had this realization a while back and it was really frustrating. For me, before that, I was so freaking happy to figure out that I was actually a girl. When the anger came, I realized that the best way to channel it, at least in my perspective, is to try to work to change it. I am really upset at cisheteronormativity, at the patriarchy, and most especially, at religion, but it’s not time to give in and hang our heads. We can work to change the world. I truly think the progress of history is on our side. We just need to survive. So now I want to focus all my frustration into doing something to help others in our positions. I want to run a cafe/shelter for lgbtq+ and other at risk folks, especially young people rejected by family and friends
 I always try to avoid anger because it’s something I’ve had issues with in the past. Despite that, I am frustrated by how we’re treated in society. However, we still need to try and be patient and respectful. There are too many on both sides who’ll lash out and hurt others, and we’re trying to be accepting.

Basically, it’s a good thing to be angry about it. Things *need* to change. Correct others, show your indignation about mistreatment, and absolutely defend yourself! Just try not to hurt anyone by acting rashly.

Love you too!
I love this! Same here. We have to keep showing up for our community when we are able. Sometimes it seems no one else will 💕.
I only avoid anger because I knew what it was like to be ignorant in the past. Towards purposefully transphobic people I have had this progression though. I'm not gonna take shit from people with below average iqs. But I try to stay calm and remind myself that I could very well be one of the only openly trans person this person meets- and I don't want to cause transphobia because I'm irritated.
Maybe not knowing was a good thing. Too many trans ppl have to hide their true selves out of fear, you didn't. This made it possible for you to have the strength and will to defend your trans brothers and sisters. 

Good on you for fighting for not just yourself, but those who have not found ur strength. Some may never feel ur strength and will need you. 

Be you, protect yourself first and, if it's safe, stick up for those who can't, but don't ever put yourself in danger if u can avoid it. 

Hell, maybe politics or political activism could be in ur future.
lol y'all are cool,  
Anytime my dad says anything negative about trans people i just sorta act like I didn't hear him and wasn't paying attention. (not out that diddle dang closet yet lol)   
or i just sorta slip away to my room.  


also to the 2 friends i am out too there's no way I'm gonna correct them about pro-nouns or whatever.  


so in conclusion, i ain't got guts."	wzvqqc	trans	252	0.97	2022-08-28 13:38:58
Posting my trans vent here too in case it gets deleted in another sub but still please help	"I want to be someone else.
I want to be reborn and be a girl and know myself as someone else.
Is the problem me not being ""special?"" No, the problem is me not feeling like a person.
Whenever i hear or see the feelings of others, it feels entrancing to me, it feels like i get to know them as a person.
But whenever i write down my own feelings, nothing happens. I do not meet myself, i do not get to know myself. I am no one. I wish i could just see myself as a person, a whole person but i can't. Because I'm in the wrong body. 
I wasn't supposed to be born like this. This is all wrong. I should have been a girl. And now my mind is saying my feelings aren't real because it's a protective mechanism against sadness and stuff and real emotions. I am in the wrong body, i do not feel like myself. I wish i could just chisel my way out of my body and into my real one. But i don't want to be me at all. I want to be a whole other person. Because I'm ugly to myself. I hate myself. I want to erase my own memories and live on as someone healthier. Someone that hasn't been abused by their father, someone that's had a healthy family, someone that is in the right body and mind. I just want to be a girl. And i want my mind to shut up and accept me. That's just all i want. Because i am a girl, but everything besides me, says I'm not. I guess it's just dysphoria, i suppose. *Sigh* i need help.
End tape."	"You are a girl. A girl facing some difficulties in life right now. It's okay to ask for help. Take a deep breath. Breath in through your nose, breath out through your mouth. And repeat after me: it will all be okay. I am special, I am loved, I am strong, I am smart and I am beautiful. Be a big sister to that little girl on the inside, protect her, comfort her and keep her happy and safe.
I know all too well how it feels. I feel the same way. every day I wake up and dysphoria hits me like a truck, ruining my motivation and amplifying my depression by thousands. 
I would give anything to have the right body and it drives me utterly insane that I don't. I feel completely isolated within myself because of the way I am.
as awful as it is, you aren't alone in how you feel, even though it feels like you are.
Jonathan Sims is this you? /jk

I understand the feeling and even invalidate my self sometimes. Stay strong and remember, you ARE a girl and are deserving of so much. You’ll get there 💕.
You are a girl ! I am a girl too and while one would say ‘right body ‘ it never feels like the me I want to be. I am forever criticizing , questioning and second guessing everything I think feel or don’t feel and especially how I look.  Some parents make this even worse :( not naming names dad ) 
    Its sounds so hard for you rn, that sucks :(  there is nothing you can feel or not feel that is wrong . It’s not fair that you have to be disappointed/ dissatisfied with anything other than everything about  you. Or that you got a shite dad who will probably figure out how beautiful you are and how much he needs you way too late .
Your memories make you you and give you power , particularly if you can learn anything , especially if you can help another sometime . Body dismorphia  is no joke , the term gets thrown  around but it very painful to experience even when it’s temporary .
Not to get all Buddhist on or conscious on you yet we are not our bodies , none of us are ! We are more ! and our experience here is limited . I truly wish I could hug you rn and share this delicious perfume I found ! ….Or spray at a distance and wave lovingly lol.  Nice smells help me feel nice.
I’m sorry but you don’t get to have that. Try to make the best of the bad hand you have been dealt. You aren’t special, you are you and that is awesome. Be you and try to love that person. You made mistakes and people hurt you, do better and let that past go. What they did was wrong but it wasn’t your fault. You are a girl. Hormones helped me a lot. I don’t know your story.
I know a place where this is possible... DM me
It can be very hard to accept yourself and love yourself, it took me at least 10 years. If you have access to it, therapy might be able to help. And despite everything your mind says, you are definitely a girl. If you want to be one, then you are one. I really hope for the best for you, and that you can become the best version of yourself.❤️❤️
I’m not that great at comforting nor advice, but I just want to tell you, you are an amazing and beautiful girl. Things seem to be so hard for you right now, being in the wrong skin, yet you cannot take it off. Shackles of the past weighing you down. Like what the others have already told you, there are technical ways to change your outer physique to match the inner you but until then, focus on the small changes you can make to your body right now and how happy they can make you! And for past memories, it is easier said than done. Though you may be left with scars afterwards, therapy and talking about your problems, opening up about your past to trusted people will help you ease the pain, you can trust me on this one. You are amazing to endure this so far, my dms are open if you want to talk more, girl!!

CW: Self-Hatred, Trusum, Transphobia, and depression. Truscum make me want to detransition	Idk why but recently I’ve thought of detransitioning because I keep seeing truscum post and thinking I’m not valid and I should give up. Truscum are wrong in every way but my brain is internally saying I’m hurting trans people and I’m not valid because I’ve barely made any progress in my transition. On top of that I’m just scared in general of possible transphobia with the recent war on trans people in the US so that adds to more pressure for me to give up and to stop transitioning. Post saying people like me are ruining the trans community makes me just want to give up and just go back to being a cis person, and I’m considering that to make the pain stop. Idk what I’m gonna do but I feel like I’m doing something wrong no matter what, idk how to feel about myself. Sorry if this post is dumb, I just feel depressed and sad. IDK if I’ll make any progress so maybe it’s best to give up? Idk at the end of the tbh	"Ugh. Sounds like you’ve been feeling horrible. I’m sorry.

You seem like the type who is emotionally impressionable (citing news and subs). This is great, the world needs feeling people. But, you need to protect yourself. You need to step back when you start internalizing things. 

Consider taking a break from news and truscum subs. Your post isn’t stupid, hon. Perhaps you could focus your tendency to internalize things and make a conscious effort to internalize some good things.  💖
In what way does being at the beginning of your journey make you invalid? You have a list of ways that you want to transition, which is great. But Rome wasn't built in a day. Would you say that 1st graders (at the beginning of their educational journey) are not ""really students""? Are they ""hurting students""? If people have a baby are they ""not really parents"" because it's their first week with their newborn? Are they ""hurting parents""? Obviously these kinds of distinctions don't make any kind of sense. 

You're welcome to be whomever you would like to be. You are valid if you are a trans person, you are valid if you are a cis person. You can go through as many or as few things on your checklist of what makes you ""really"" one of those things and still be valid.

Feeling depressed and sad is terrible. Gatekeeping who ""gets"" to be trans is dumb. You get to decide that and no one else. You're not hurting trans people by exploring your identity, you're not hurting trans people by identifying as trans, and you're not dong anything wrong by progressing in your transition at your own speed. 

Yes, transphobia is scary. Yes, gatekeepers can make you feel bad. But here's the real question: what would make you happy? Would meeting the goals on your transition list make you happier than you are now? Would being seen differently by society make you feel better than you do now? It's ok if you need time to process and experiment and determine whether or not these things are true, but the reality is that a bunch of people on the internet don't get to decide those things. You get to. 

So here's my advice: stay off of truscum forums: they are obviously making you feel bad about yourself and providing you with no benefit. Write down a list of transition goals that you think would make you happy. Start with small, achievable things. Maybe (probably, honestly, if you're here in this forum) that's a super long list, maybe there's nothing on that list. Try to meet at least at one of your transition goals, and see if it makes you happier than you are right now. If it does, keep going at your own pace. If it doesn't, go back and reevaluate the things that you think would make you happy. 

All the best. And please, if you need someone to talk to, please reach out to one of the many trans hotline resources. I like the trans lifeline in the US and Canada, [https://translifeline.org/](https://translifeline.org/) US: (877) 565-8860, Canada: (877) 330-6366. If you're in the UK, there are resources here: [https://www.trans.ac.uk/ResourcesInformation/Helplines/tabid/7257/Default.aspx](https://www.trans.ac.uk/ResourcesInformation/Helplines/tabid/7257/Default.aspx), if you're in the EU you may find some resources here [https://www.coe.int/en/web/sogi/victim-support-organisations](https://www.coe.int/en/web/sogi/victim-support-organisations) and if you're in crisis anywhere in the world, please refer to this list to find a resource near you [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_suicide\_crisis\_lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)
Number one - obsessive thoughts can make you want to pain seek in odd ways. Stay off the truscum forums by any means necessary!

Number two - you are likely ""more valid"" than many people who question or even dive in. I will likely never tell more people in my real life beyond my husband that I consider myself trans. Frankly, it is NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT YOURS.

Like, for serious. Nobody's going to ""card you"" on your transness. Only you can answer if you're trans or not, no one else. If detransitioning will make you feel BETTER, that would be one thing, but doing it because other people say you should? Code 404, does not compute, they can mind their business.

Stick with us, kid.
Only people ruining the trans community are people who tear others down for not meeting their standards to be ‘trans enough’ to deserve help and support. Forget these people, you are valid. I hope you’re able to feel better soon. I know how the media and general societal transphobia hurts, I’m living on TERF island and had my very first IRL interaction with a transphobe yesterday. Please stay strong. I believe in you, you can do this!
I know exactly where you are coming from, cause I’ve been there too. What you are feeling is perfectly normal, especially for trans people to feel. Being early or not making progress in your transition is okay, there’s nothing wrong with that. Being trans isn’t about passing or making progress, it’s just about being happy. Even if can’t medically transition for whatever reason, that doesn’t make you cis or anything. Trans people are trans people, even if they can’t transition. No matter what, you still deserve to be called by your real name and pronouns, you deserve to be treated the way you want to be treated. You are valid, you belong here. Don’t detransition just because it’s what other people want from you, do what you want. It can be hard, it will be hard, but you can do it. Feel free to DM me if you need to talk or vent, I’m always happy to help.
I feel where you’re coming from but please, try not to internalise all that negativity. I’m as guilty as the next person for doing it, but it always leads to a downward spiral.

Nobody can judge your progress except you, and we all tend to be our own harshest critics. I know how it feels as I do it too. And you know something? I think an awful lot of us do, too.
lifes too short to deny your happiness, to only make other people comfortable. you know who you are, so forget the haters and chase your happiness.
The mainstream trans community is based around gender identity. If your gender identity has changed, then that's fine and you're valid. Opting for HRT and other stuff is all optional.

Truscum are not the mainstream and they don't really decide what happens in the trans community. They can't gate-keep being trans or your gender identity.
First off transitioning doesn't have to be so fast and hard! Some stay in the closet or are slow to transition but each Journey is unique and different!! 

not everybody is always going to be satisfied with their choice every single day! of course there are doubts of course there are moments where you might feel hopeless but that cannot compare to the joy that also comes 

I genuinely browse alternative or radical places like r/truscum and 4chan and just other places of idiocy and its most often rooted in self hatred, hatred and misinformation
Idk if this helps, but if you detrans just because of them you're letting those shit heads win. Personally I couldn't do it.
Truscums truly are scum. You are no less trans because you're only just beginning your journey, you are no less trans because you haven't figured it all out yet. They all act like this is just something that boils and brews your entire life and one day you just transition and that's it. I didn't know I was trans until I was 10 and there are people who didn't know they were trans until they were 40. Your journey is solely your own so don't pay attention to what bitter conservative pieces of shit have to say.
don’t let morons gatekeep you out of your own health and wellbeing. not conservatives, not truscum, not anybody. stay strong, be patient with yourself; whatever happens, we’ll be here for you ❤️
Do not let truscum get your down!!! Many of them are sad people and they can only feel good by putting own others. You are loved and I  want you to know that you are valid and wonderful!!!!
My advise, don’t listen to anyone who has literal scum in their name and is proud about it. No one, absolutely no one, gets to decide rules for who you are. There is no set formula to being trans, we are all valid and we all have different experiences. Fuck truscum and fuck the notion that you have to follow their rules to be valid as a trans person.
what is truscum
The right answer is whatever will make you happy long-term. That can be anything - continuing to transition, stopping whereever you are on your journey, or detransitioning. 

Your decision can be propelled by others opinions, but usually when that's the case it can lead to decisions that make you happy short-term vs. long-term (or not happy at all). 

Do some soul searching and whatever you land on is okay. You're important and valuable in whatever direction you move.  

Good luck, OP. 💛
I know ppl who identify on the trans spectrum but don’t do any gender affirmation procedures or hrt.  None of it!  They are still valid amazing awesome trans ppl!  You don’t have to transition to be trans imho.
I don’t know, with those feelings ever just go away though? I don’t think so.

Hitchhiking as a Trans Woman?	"I always dreames of hitchhiking across Europe. Visiting as many countries as possible, seeing beautiful vistas and visiting historical places, with only whatever I can carry on my backpack.

The thing is I am also a trans woman. Both the words ""woman"" amd ""trans"" don't scream safety, even more so when combined.

I'm still pre-everything and don't pass at all, so I could easily do it in boymode. But who knows where I'll be in my transition journey when I decide to go, and in an ideal world I would much rather do it as my authentic self.

Do you think I'm overthinking the risks of going hitchhiking? How risky it trully is? If there are any trans hitchhikers in here, I'd love to hear your stories and tips for when my time comes.

[UPDATE] Well this blew up overnight. Opinions ranged all the way from ""it's a death wish"" to ""it's pretty chill"", although the vast majority seems to think it's a really bad idea. Oddly enough the few people who were favourable to the idea are the ones who claim to have actual experience with hitchhiking.

Still, it's better safe than sorry, so I'll probably not be hitching any hikes anytime soon. There were many good suggestions on how to move about the Old World without having to rely on the kindness of strangers, the main ones being the ride sharing app Blablacar, and buying an Eurotrail pass for cheap train travel (choo choo!).

I'll admit that I kind of forgot that hitchhiking and backpacking were not synonyms, and I might have used the words interchangably. Still it's sad that it seems to be so dangerous to trust other people. Hitchhiking has a certain glamour that, sadly, seems to be lost in the real world.

Thank you so much for all who showed concern towards me! I trully appreciate you stopping by to show your concern to a stranger. If more people were like you, maybe we could all hitchhike in safety."	"I would strongly recommend buying a Eurorail pass. Yeah you’ll spend a bit of money, but it’s much much safer.
Hitchhiking is a bad idea.  
Every girl I know who did, had to get out of some dangerous messed up situation.  
Also, it‘s totally unneccessary:  
Europe has a great network of trains and busses. Get a train ticket for exploring europe and enjoy.
Hitch-hiking in general is a bad idea.

It's romanticised WAY too much. Doesn't matter if you are male or female, trans or cis. You should NOT hitch-hike unless there is abdolutely no other option.

It's even more dangerous in a country you don't live in, as you won't be able to take account of the 'red-flags' that may be known to locals, and people will prey on that.

Basically, it's a bad idea at best, and s*cide mission at worst.

(Sorry, not trying to come across as harsh, but please keep yourself safe.)
I’m sorry but that sounds like the least safe thing it’s possible to do. I have never done anything like it so I’m not the person to ask, but I doubt it’s even safe for cis men, it’s obviously super dangerous for any woman. Can’t you just take a bus or something?

Europe has all kinds of trains and stuff right?
I do see hitchhiker's in Germany quite frequently, and have picked them up a couple of times. But never solo females. I have also hitchhiked in Norway when I was a guy when I was hiking because walking through the tunnels is very dangerous (not much oxygen, lots of carbon monoxide, you start to get green and purple vision lol)
  
I think from my experience you would be fairly ok in eg Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands and Germany as long as you were able to refuse rides, but that's not really hitchhiking. In boymode of course.
  
Better and safer idea that's more reliable: We have this ride-sharing thing called blablacar, where people register car journeys they are taking and you can share the ride. It is extremely cheap and you can go very long distances, it is also fairly reliable and there are lots of journeys every day between any two locations. It's quite social too.
  
Also, you should take advantage of the excellent train services. You can do something called interrail that gives you a train pass for a few weeks.
  
Basically, there just isn't that much hitchhiking, and it's probably not a good idea as a trans person. Mostly it's smelly hippies anyway and nobody wants them in their Audi.
Don't.  It's extremely dangerous.
Honestly traveling Europe it’s easiest just to get a eurail pass. They are seriously not that expensive and you can go anywhere. Best way to travel Europe.
Don't hitchhike. No matter how you look, don't ever do that, that's really just inviting danger in. Go with Flixbus if you wanna travel cheaply or maybe go by train, but never ever ever hitchhike unless you have somewhat of a deathwish.
You could do interrailing instead. That's something a lot of people do where they pay for being able to travel by train across Europe for a set number of days. It's not going to be as romantic as hitchhiking but it's safer and you can still visit cool areas. The train network across Europe is pretty good
Hunny. Please don't
Welp everyone seems to be in agreement lol. Yea I wouldnt hitchhike if I was a burly cis guy with US marine hand to hand combat training cause three guys in a car with guns on u is gonna make it rlly hard to do anything, even if u have a gun or knives or any other weapons yourself it’s basically pointless. If ur traveling across Europe a little silent panic button might be a nice investment
No, just no.
I’m a cis white male, and the first thing I think of when someone says “hitchhike” is “I’m gonna get murdered”. I’m gonna say just take a train trip or a river cruise if you want to see lots of places in one go. Hitchhiking no matter what you present as sounds like a great way to become a missing person.
Trans european (french) here! I recommend using Blablacar. It's *a lot* cheaper than a train and usually safe (you can choose to travel with women drivers if it makes you feel safer, and read review about drivers and other passengers. But you may not always find people who speak english.
I have heard that trains across Europe are amazing, they sound like an infintely safer option
Only times I ever felt comfortable hitch hiking was on a small island in summer when we were coming back from the beach, it was a rl small and friendly community so it was totally fine. Other time was when we were going back to our trailer we were staying in on holiday and there was a mom bear on road and we got a lift back with an old lady instead of walking by after dark (also in a small and friendly and generally safe area) Generally Tho hitchhiking is rl not a good idea for anyone even if your a cis dude with multiple friends, anything can happen ya know
Well I haven’t been to Europe so hard to say what the situation is. Now I will say off the top of my thoughts no, I agree with another comment that it is generally not safe for cis gender. In the 1960’s and 1970’s generally speaking was safe in the USA and Canada. I will say no way women hitched in the USA Canada was a different story beautiful girls hitched all over especially Western provinces. I myself hitched all over the USA in the early 1970’s would I today absolutely not it’s to dangerous. I’m older of course and have experience and I’m non binary but I’m married to a girl. I feel your frustration on wanting to be yourself and that’s healthy but please don’t put yourself in harms way. 
Please make the best of it and understand most folks don’t understand what you are experiencing shamefully as it is. 
Hugs and safe travels
There’s a Facebook group called Solo Female Travelers. I would suggest checking it out. My partner uses it and they have told me lots of great things about how helpful it can be. They will have a ton of advice and suggestions for you down to the best places to stay in specific cities if you need that.
On my bucket fantasy list
I am a trans woman andI have hitchhiked throughout Central Europe over the summer and I was fine, make sure u don’t do it alone tho 😅
I do not know about now adays but it used to be common to hitchhike with truckers and use church resources offered to truckers til you hit a town you want to site see or temp live at and pick up a cash job.   (This was told to me buy people who traveled Europe in the early 2000s) so it is probably different
I’m travelling Mexico solo, I have no problems here at all but I do pass pretty well. (Mexico is very homophobic and bigoted unfortunately since they’re very behind in some ways)
Trans man here, I've had the same dream since forever. I'd love to hitchhike across Europe, maybe western Asia as well and/or south America some day. Just go without knowing where I'll sleep tomorrow and try to make new acquaintances along the way. 

Maybe I'm lucky because someday, I might pass enough to hitchhike with male privilege. Maybe I'm unlucky because if I'm not brave enough to transition, I'll have to do it as the wrong gender _and_ with the added dangers of being seen as a woman.

I do believe you could eventually eliminate the trans bit and be stealth, especially since you don't spend huge amounts of time with the same people while hitchhiking. But still that sounds unsafe especially in eastern and maybe southern Europe. Boymode would be safe but I can see how you wouldn't want that. 

Is it safer to hitchhike as a group? I could come along yknow ;)
Even when navigating the world as a little girl, the ""don't walk alone"" fears never got to me, so I'm not giving a superstition / fear based answer.

Don't. At least not in East Europe. In Hungary you'll just have lots of trouble, as a foreigner who doesn't speak the language, as a woman, as trans. And who knows what the situation will be when you get here, both here and in Poland the laws and attitudes are not great... But at least we have trains and barely anyone has guns, so you can absolutely backpack all over the place on public transport and won't get shot.

Edit: btw if any of you are planning a visit to Hungary and need some couch surfing options near the capital, I may be able to figure something out with a few days notice, no guarantees except lots of cat hair
Backpacking is safe enough, hitchhiking alone absolutely not.

Backpacking culture is incredible and everyone looks out for one another. You’ll easily find a group that will give zero fucks about your transness, and you will be safer for their company.

Hitchhiking is usually part of the experience, but is a risk for anyone. I wouldn’t suggest hitchhiking solo to anyone, least of all a non-stealth trans person. Trust your instincts and don’t sacrifice your safety for politeness. Decline a ride if you feel any kind of uneasy, especially if you even think you may have been clocked in a negative way.

Violence is a fact of life for trans people. Don’t let anyone invalidate that fear. But also look at it as a risk to be managed, rather than something that should limit your dreams.
One last thought on your update. While I am not bashing addiction because this has become a relentless problem and people do crazy things on drugs. Hard drugs has exasperated the violence world wide and has to many degrees disrupted some of our most cherished past times “ unfortunately”. The world is not as safe as during my younger years and while I feel most folks would embrace new acquaintances there is always that one that puts your life in danger. Yes I traveled all over the USA in the early 70’s and loved it I had so much fun and the stories I can tell of my experiences. However I will agree with other comments to go for it be you just make sure and analyze what to are about to do. I’m just stating my position that it is to dangerous in my opinion. We will never meet but it would be nice to have met you in a safe place so I could hear about your transition and share my fantasies. Good luck my friend and stay safe!
Just do what you want to do
Not at all it’s not safe anywhere anymore
Hitchhiking is pretty dangerous no matter who you are but especially so for trans folks. If you want a similar but safer experience I recommend public transportation. The public transportation system in Europe is amazing compared to America and you can get literally anywhere
I am a trans man, and hitchhiked for a year in the U.S. also hitchhiked with someone who was trans femme but butched it up on the road (she's pretty butch anyway so it was natural, not hiding herself more than she was comfortable with).

I would not recommend hitchhiking alone. Pairs is where it's at bc it's just so much safer all around. Here in the u.s we call that a ""road dog"". Others can speak more on this from me, but from stories with my friends, hitchhiking as a woman are inflicted with a lot of creepy solicitations and bad vibes.

Wishing you luck. Hope you can find a friend to travel with!

If you have no such luck in finding a buddy, perhaps more traveling with less hitchhiking is in order, like using a euro pass. Plus side of the euro pass is you can sleep saftley on the train (sleep is a big obstacle when hitchhiking anyway).

Good luck OP!

Hit me up if you have any other questions.
Honestly, it depends on the region. Western and northern Europe? Hell yes! Balticum? Hell no! Balkan? Depends on the country.

I'd probably swap hitchhiking for an InterRail pass, though. You won't get a 1st-class suite on any train with it, but it's warmer, cozier and most of all more secure than getting into strangers' cars.
Me even before going on HRT never could trust any unknown male... I never hitch hiked ever or enter strange people's apartment.  They all wanted sex
Please dont hitchhike. Its so dangerous its just not worth it.
Maybe New Zealand would be a better option if you are set on a hitchhiking trip.
You can travel by train all over Europe. Much more convenient and definately a lot safer!
Train trip! Thanks for the suggestion, I'll keep it in mind!
Eurorail would be safe and ideal to explore Europe
Was just going to say the same thing. DO NOT HITCHHIKE in Europe. Especially not alone and most certainly not as a trans woman. Most western states are ok for trans people, Eastern EU on the other hand is def not safe for trans people in general. 

Eurorail passes are cool, but I’d still stay away from places like Poland, Hungary and Italy.
I went to Europe and bought the euro rail pass, big mistake, each train rides cost way less and taking the bus is also so convenient. I ended up wasting half my pass as well and it wouldn’t even work for tgv either
I appreciate the concern. It's a bummer but you seem to be on the side of the consensus.
[removed]
Yeah, even as a grown cis man, I would definitely not put myself in such a compromised situation. Once you step into their vehicle, you are in the space of a stranger.
Do this.
Bla bla car is cheap, useful and most of the time there is a ride to most major cities in Germany.
For the time there won't be any, get a train pass.
I heard about this app before. Can you explain me how it works and how it differs from other ride sharing apps like Uber?
Train does sound like the mist recommended way to go about. And trains are pretry cool as well. Cheaper than an Eurotrail pass would be train surfing but, contrary to what most people in here might think, I don't ACTUALLY have a death wish.
What's this fixbus thing, if I may ask?
It would be a nice chamge of pace to be in a part of the world that actually has trains.
I appreciate the concern, but you make it sound like every person who picks up hitchhikers is a psycopath with a collection of machetes on the trunk. If that were the case, there wouldn't be any hitchhikers anywhere anymore.

Still, train sounds nice and that's probably what I'm going with.
I heard good things about this app. How does it work, and how does it differ from something like Uber?
Thanks for the tip but I'd rather not return to Facebook. Maybe I can find a similar group somewhere else.
Sure thing! Central/North Europe seems to be the saver region to do this kind of stuff.
Alas East Europe/West Asia doesn't seem to be too friendly towards queer people. Even though I'd love to know Poland or Russia I don't think I'd go there any time soon.

I was wondering the same thing about hitchhiking in groups. Maybe having a hike buddy would keep the more undesirable people away.
Hitchhike with a friend!

If you have a buddy, there is always someone able to sit behind the driver and make sure nothing dangerous goes down!
I hitchhiked for a year around the U.S. as a 1 year on T guy. With a friend I think it's a lot safer
While I'd like to visit East Europe, I know that the situation there is not the best for queer people, unfortunately.

But cat hair sounds lovely, sign me up!
Well the backpacking is the priority, so at least it'a good to know that that's still an option. Hitchhiking could be a cool experience but I have no problem switching it for a train ride or a ride share app.
Well it's certainly a breath of fresh air to find someone who doesn't think it's a suic**e mission. Finding a hiking buddy would probably be best for hitchhiking, although I'm leaning towards a train pass. Thanks for the tips!
Yeah, East Europe seems to be a no-go for queer people, unfortunately. Interestingly, you seem to be okay with the idea in West/North Europe, which is more than pretry much anyone here.

Lots of people also recommended the InterRail/Eurotrail pass, not sure what the difference is here. I also heard about the ride sharing app Blablacar, and something called Fixbus.
Why is that? Is NZ that much safer than Europe? I wouldn't mind backpacking across Middle Earth.
No need to be rude about it.

I do know what I'm talking about, especially as someone who has travelled by himself for years. You may have different experiences, and that's cool.

I also live in a place full of backpackers. People don't hitch-hike, it's too risky. Unless they want their body to end up dismembered in a barell, which happens.

When you hitchike you take a risk. When you hitchhike as a woman, you double that risk. When you hitch hike as a trans woman, you quadruple that risk. When you hitch hike as an early transition trans woman, you 100x multiply that risk.

To OP: if you wanna do it, go for it. But know the risks.
Well your comment certainly is a stark contrast to the others here. Interesting how positive you feel about it having first-hand experience. Makes me wonder how many of the people who think it's a super bad idea have actually hitchhiked before.
People only take you on for rides they weee already planning on doing.

I.e you work in Hamburg but live in Berlin, so you drive to Berlin every Friday and back to Hamburg every Sunday. 

So you put in that repeating trip in the app, set where you will be able to pick up someone and then they‘ll book your ride.


Or maybe you are going from Hamburg to Hannover for a business trip. Just put it on the app and earn a few Euros extra.


Hence pick up sites mostly being limited to central features of those cities and Autpbahn Rest stops in between, unless the autpbahn happens to pass right through a city.



Blablacar is an actual ride sharing app.

Uber etc are just modern taxi services exploiting the hog economy.
So basically people who are driving from eg Barcelona to Madrid to visit their grandmother register an account and upload their journey details and any stops. There is a fixed price calculated for the distance that people will pay to take a seat in the car. Blablacar takes the payments for 3 seats people sign up for and sends it to the driver. After the journey the three people give ratings. Most drivers use the app regularly - some people use it on their commute for example.
  
My partner sometimes uploads her ride when she goes from Germany to a neighboring country. The people are normally fine, but having to make extra stops crazy-taxi style to pick people up and drop them off is time consuming.
  
So it's like Uber but it's not professional and the distance can be much much longer - think Paris to Bruges.
You can just get an account and have a look - it's quite sophisticated.
It’s a German company that offers extremely cheap bus fares.
UK has lots of trains here too :) sometimes in London it can get a bit congested but overall it's nice 

You can have a fun adventure
It only takes one psychopath to ruin your life.

Ultimately the question is “how much do you value your safety and how much are you willing to risk?”
I mean, a guy I went to high school with “disappeared” while trying to hitch from our town to Colorado… so I may be a little paranoid.
You act like a person has to be a “psychopath with a machete” to be dangerous. It doesn’t take some special, evil person to do violence. It could really easily be some random guy.

Also, human trafficking, mugging, etc is a real thing, and as a tourist you would be a target. For example, my dad was once on a trip overseas, walking with my sibling (who was like 8 at the time) and a guy tried to convince him to come into an unmarked building to see an art gallery. Sketchy as that sounds, in the moment my dad was about to go in because the guy seemed completely genuine and nonthreatening. But he remembered that he had read about a scam where people do that exact thing to tourists in order to mug them.
So people on Blablacar are not professionnals, they're just going somewhere and have decided to take passengers for some money. You just have to go on the app or website, enter the town you're leaving, the one where you're going and the day. And then Blablacar will give you all the drivers passing by both towns (or towns near the ones you asked for). You pay on the app, and then the driver has to accept taking you (it's pretty fast, a few hours max). If they refuse you get a text and you get your money back. If they accept you get a text giving you the driver's phone number.

You can also send messages through blablacar before paying.
Same. I'll only go there once I'm 100% certain I'm trad looking. We have plenty of friends from Poland (older ones) and while they're all incredibly welcoming and sweet, there is no being queer in their presence. 

At the very least, travelling in groups or pairs would make it harder to trap and/or ransack you
Ohh that sounds great! Now I just need to find a buddy who's okay with having a bit of an unclear travel itinerary, my friends are all used to squeaky clean hotels. Will definitely try one day though. Props to you for getting there! Where'd you travel if I may ask?
Yeah, train pass is definitely what I'd do in Europe!!

Hitchhiking takes a lot of mental and emotional energy to deal with. The expensive part for a Europe trip is the plane ticket and lodging. Train ticket would save you time and a lot of mental energy otherwise constantly planning rides/not knowing where you'll end up.

Hope you can bring your dream to life!!! Good luck!
I took a van trip across New Zealand 10 years ago and it always felt safe. I remember thinking this place would be the place to hitchhike. I don’t know the actual situation now but I did see travelers hitch hiking.
Interesting. I'll certainly keep it in mind.
Yes, as far as I know you can travel to multiple European cities though.
One of the funniest things I noticed when visiting London was how much people complained about hands down the best public transport system I've ever used.
Sounds simple enough! I'll ceetainly consider it when/if I go backpacking.
We left from Kansas City and travelled mostly parallel and West of Missouri. If you look at a map, Westward is much less dense, and so was much easier to find places to sleep for free than the larger metropolises Eastward.

It's so very beautiful
Lmao. It is very very difficult at rush hour. Especially for people commuting regularly. Anyone that lives long term in London hates the public transport as the tourists use the same stuff and it gets super congested. But that's the nature of being a mega city it's going to be like that lol
oh I forgot! they also have bus (which belongs to blablacar) they are *really* cheap. so if you see one take it.
I don't know about that. I worked in London for six months and got on both the tube and bus more than once during rush hour. Sure it was crammed and slow, but nothing compared to my home city. And besides you have maps of the bus routes in every stop! And a display showing the arrival time! That stuff blew my mind!"	s4f295	trans	233	0.98	2022-01-15 07:41:15
Just realized I'm MTF and I need help	"Hi all, I just want to start by saying this is very scary for me, even with the anonymity.  


But, a week or so ago, I got high and uncovered some repressed memories of when I would try on my mother's clothes when I was home alone and it just feeling... right?  


After that I started having dreams where I was a woman, nothing sexual just day to day life but as a woman, and I felt sad when I woke up and saw myself in the mirror.  


This is all so new to me... and I just... don't know what to do."

Welcome!

The Dysphoria Bible is a good place to start \[it's a long, but good, read\]...can also experiment, or make an appointment with a therapist that has trans/GSRM \[Gender, Sexuality, and Romantic Minorities\] experience.  

Most importantly though, don't lose heart...feeling overwhelmed at this point is normal.  ""Holy shit, this fundamental part of my identity...isn't"" is a LOT to process.
Take some time to research if you want, it may take you awhile to really know, you may even be in denial for quite sometime but it’ll all be on your own timing of whatever you decide you are.

Ask yourself these questions:
Can you see yourself as an old woman in the future? Can you see yourself as an old man in the future? Which do you feel more happier and euphoric about? How does it feel if people online call you she/her/ma’am/miss/lady/girly? All of those feminine pronouns?
Hey Penelope. I relate hard to the memories, I'll say not to be surprised if more come up to the surface in your near future. Welcome to the community :D
I'd say do what you want to do. Which involves figuring out what you want to do.

I'll provide some commonly chosen actions with a disclaimer that this list is neither exhaustive and nothing here is necessary to be yourself:

* Feminizing Hormone Replacement Therapy
* Name Change
* Pronoun change
* Changes to how you dress
* Hair Removal
* Makeup
* Voice training
* Surgeries
* Social transition

The most important thing to do in my mind is this: Remember that no matter what you are: wonderful, valid, deserving of love, deserving of respect, and uniquely yourself. Remember that should you decide to transition to keep each action small. It is so easy to see this all as once colossal thing, a monolith that cannot be overcome. Try to see that everything can be done with small steps in the right direction. You have the rest of your life to both figure out who you are and to help yourself achieve what it is you desire. 

Remember to give yourself time and space and to take breaks, find time to enjoy yourself, and always seek what brings you joy and fulfilment.
We ruv you Penelope 💜💜💜
Hey Penelope, I'm relatively new here as well and just wanted to say that it will start off a little  overwhelming, but transitioning is not just one big leap but a hundred small steps. You can take these steps as fast as you want, or as slow as you want, but regardless you have people here you can ask for advice. I saw some other people mention this, and I'll reccomend it too, check out the gender dysphoria bible as it is a brilliant resource for new people in the community. Best of luck! - Ash
Hello, my name is Feyla (she/her)
I know grappling with gender stuff can be difficult, if you ever need to chat my DMs are open to any trans or trans questioning person that needs someone to talk to.
I actually just came out to my parents today and this is all new to me too. Welcome to the club!
Hi Penelope! The feeling of finding yourself gets familiar but never old.

Something I found helpful when I just came out was looking up a list of gender labels and seeing what fit. Also, the gender unicorn is a helpful exercise.

https://transstudent.org/gender/
This path you are seeing before you in trepidation ia a beautiful journey of little steps and leaps of faith.Its is uniquely your own but you are not alone there are many Beautiful Humans you can and will share it with.The path is always waiting and it's never to late because its not a race it's a journey ❤
Hey Gorgeous, my journey started exactly the same way. Dreams and unrepressing the deeper meaning behind my cross-dressing while lit af, honestly it's been some of the most empowering life experiences to date. For me it always felt overwhelming, I never really had any of the support or resources, or starting points. It all felt... So surreal, like a dream where there were supposed to be a few more guide posts? 🤷🏻‍♀️ But my advice? Trust your friends and try as much as you possibly feel comfortable. Everything that makes you feel more you, do it. Some of itay seem so scary at first and honestly sometimes that's the best part, that can help point you in the direction you actually want to go. Unsure about that? Talk to your friends, ask about what aesthetics their into and where their inspirations came from, realising that fear of taking that next step isn't just you ❤️
PS. Love the name- you're beautiful ❤️❤️❤️

~ Isabelle 💗
woah /pos
Thank you all for the warm welcome and advice. While this is still scary for me. Your love and support is making it easier.

I love all of you already 💖

You really know how to make a girl feel special!
I remember when my egg cracked. It’s pretty scary because the implications are so huge. My advice would be to take it one day at a time. You have a lot of major life decisions ahead, and you’re allowed to take however long you need to figure them out
Hello Penelope. How are you? Feeling better after the post?


""I started having dreams where I was a woman, nothing sexual just day to day life but as a woman, and I felt sad when I woke up and saw myself in the mirror.""

This is very relatable. I also have those dreams. But they kinda stopped after I came out and started presenting myself as a woman. Now I dream with other stuff, ""regular"" stuff. I'm still a woman in those dreams, but it's different, it's not what the dream is about anymore, you know?
Welcome!

This can be anxiety provoking at first - many of us have been there. It gets easier.

Being able to say it is a big thing, and you should feel proud of yourself for talking about it here!

The dreams of being a woman without a sexual aspect are very common for trans women before we come out.

What to do is the harder part - do you have any inkling of how the people in your life will respond?

In the short run, I’d encourage you to find a person you can talk to and trust with this in person, because that can help you navigate this so much to have someone you can open up to.

Spaces like this are excellent too - talking to and interacting with people who are like yourself helps so much. Even more so if you can find some groups near you.

Penelope is a lovely name! An excellent choice!
I used to wear my mom's high heels, loved the free perfume samplers on me, and got excited that I was confused for a girl on the phone. Those were also repressed for me. Now I'm wearing makeup to work and pitching my voice up, so I can relate to repressed memories and dreams.
The shock at first is ofc shocking but this is your choice , this is who you want to be in the future and you already are a beautiful girl !! 

Warm welcome , Miya 💕
Penelope - Pronouns: She/Her
Thanks! I'll have to check it out!
Can't recommend the dysphoria Bible enough, it's awesome!!
I'm sure there are more, but I'll make sure I'm ready for them when they come
I ruv you too!
Hi Feyla, thank you for the offer. You can never have too many friends
That's incredibly brave, I don't think I will ever be able to do that. My mother is a tiny town protestant, so she is very... conservative in her views, I'm not sure about my father though, we're kind of estranged.
Thank you for that <3
Thank you, I'll take that to heart. File it right next to cheese and wine ❤️  


It's honestly so comforting knowing that I'm not alone. Well, I knew that I wasn't going to be alone but this helped me finally believe it
Isabelle is a gorgeous name ❤️❤️❤️
Hi, and yes. I am feeling better after the post and seeing all the wonderful support. You all have just been simply fantastic!
Thank you, I'm so happy I'm going to cry 😭
This is my new friend penelope, she's gorgous and funny
hi Penelope, i’m Ronan :)

Cute 🥰 Hello Penelope
Hi Ronan, thank you so much for the warm welcome
Just a new girl in a new year ❤
What uuuup gurl. How yah doing? :)
Hey Penelope, I’m Iris 🥰 I discovered after many years I’m bisexual, I know it’s not the same but I also only recently remembered the things I had repressed, like you’ve always known but somehow that part of your brain just… disappeared? Until you find it again and I’m happy you’ve found your true self again ❤️ if you need someone to talk to or just anything I’m here 😘
Better now that the initial shock is starting to wear off :)
Hi Iris, lovely name, pleasure to meet you.  


I have a theory that my childhood memories being repressed could be because my mother had several abusive boyfriends during my critical development years. Ages 9-16 weren't all that great.
Heyo Penelope , I’m Miya nice to meet u !
Hi Miya, lovely to meet you"	ryru1i	trans	231	1.0	2022-01-08 04:58:14
2022 is the scariest time to live in recently	"I am so frightened of 2022 it’s only the second month and there’s a on going war with Putin and Ukraine 

Not to mention Florida just passed the “don’t say gay” bill and Texas is trying to make it so they can prosecute parents for being child abusers if they are accepting of their transgender child 

Like things are getting worse and my heart goes to those in Ukraine and I hope your ok

And if you live in Florida or Texas and your trans or lgbtq+ in general I hope you stay safe as well and please remember you matter your not an abomination and you are valid and human like everyone else 

And these monsters that are in charge are terrifying and I wish we were moving forward but sadly we’re only going backwards 

And even though I don’t live in Texas or Florida it doesn’t mean I’m not terrified for LGBTQ+ youth but I’m also scared of the Texas trans law and Florida’s bill being in other places I’m scared that those will be put in place where I live 

Like we’re children we did nothing wrong why can’t we live just why

Let kids be kids and discover themselves 

I’m sorry for those in Ukraine and I’m sorry for LGBTQ+ youth in Texas and Florida"	"To be fair, the FL bill has only passed one of the houses. It still has to get though the other one.

And maybe it's my perspective due to my age, but this is still overall the best possible time to be trans in the US (a few states not withstanding). 20+ years ago, when I was in HS, it was a bad for us almost everywhere.

Basically what I'm saying is focus on the good. Don't ignore the bad, and still fight to change it, but don't let it consume you.
Sadly there is always bad stuff going on. Perhaps there's more than most right now, but it's always possible to feel overwhelmed from world events. There's nothing wrong with unplugging for a bit if it's too much.
I'm normally one who's able to realize that bad things happen all the time in the world, and aren't always broadcast on the world stage..

But something about this Ukraine situation just has me deeply unsettled, highly emotional, and just...afraid though I'd never admit to anyone I know in person.

Whenever I pay attention to current events happening in Ukraine, My body just shakes and I find myself holding back tears. Tears of fear but also tears of sadness, so many lives being lost and thrown away because of a fascist dictators lust for power and greed.. Russian.. Ukrainian... So many lives just being lost, but the bravery and courage of the Ukrainian people must not ever be lost or forgotten.

And so many trans hate laws trying to get pushed into effect, hate and violence towards trans people seems to be rising (though statistically idk if thats true but seems like it is)

People can say ""focus on the good"" but that does nothing but try to hide away the bad things happening as if its some dirty secret that must not be known. Ukrainian lives are being lost and the citizens are afraid, it's beyond insensitive to tell people during the brink of a possible World War 3 to ""focus on the good"" 

No we must focus and pay attention to current events, we can't keep acting like ""the good things are what matters""
Living in the us with what texas is doing ive decided to buy a gun cause the us is moving into facism. at least i can leave soon too
If you only let yourself look at the bad, you'll miss the good parts. The fact that these kind of...well, not laws so much as publicity stunts get noticed is because rights are so much stronger and more prominent than before. These kind of bullshit shenanigans wouldn't have made a splash outside of state news back when I was a kid. Now, it's a point of digust internationally. Even being heard is a big hurdle, and it's a hurdle we're cleared. Things are still moving in the right direction.

That invasion thing is, yeah, that's a kick in the delicates, for sure. We'll have to make it through, and that'll take courage. Courage is having a plan and following through. Take control to overcome fear. Find out how you can help, and do it. Follow your country's reaction and push for aid, make donations, whatever you can. You're more powerful than you may give yourself credit for. We'll push through this together.
when you want to be glad to not live in florida or texas but then you remember how much russia could fuck everything up soon
of course there are things that are not changing or even getting worse

but there is also so much stuff getting better. not to mention the things that are coming once the good part of gen z starts to take over this world. the lgbtqia+ community is growing and we will change things for the better.
Sadly, I’ll never go to the US again. The country where I grew up, went to school and where we still have a lot of family - it’s incredibly heart breaking to see it turn into a backward, hate filled place :-(
15 years ago, the idea of coming out as trans seemed like it was impossible.

Things only get better through strife, no progress was won without enduring a scary situation to get there.
But I think your right I need to try staying positive through this horrific time and I’ll try my best it’s just all this news is hitting me full force and it’s like I can’t breath
I'm a few years younger but even graduating (from a mid-west U.S.) high school in 2010 people were just coming around to the fact that ""gay"" or ""queer"" wasn't okay to say as an insult. There was absolutely no positive representation, and I thought I was a lonely weirdo, or ideally that other dudes had these thoughts. But no one talked about it...

Things are scary right now, there's no doubt that the world stage is using LGBTQ+ people to divide and radicalize.

Hearing high school kids on here talk about how there's a group of queer people at school that they hang out with is incredibly encouraging for the future!
I don’t mean this in any rude way or anything like that but I strongly disagree I think it’s one of the scariest times of being trans and LGBTQ+ because if these becomes laws it I have no doubt in my mind that this will cause suicide rates to go even higher because being outed when your not ready is already bad enough but also having a possible law being passed where you’ll be separated from your supportive family just because some religious monsters see it as abuse is even worse because your taken away from your support system and they don’t even care about children they never have if they did they wouldn’t be doing this and they’d realize how dangerous this is but sadly they don’t and this is the world we’re living in
That’s what I’m thinking of doing because I’ve had a few breakdowns because of what’s going on like I am terrified and I feel helpless and I wish this was all just a horrible nightmare and wake up but sadly it’s really happening and there’s a crushing weight on my chest the more I see and hear like the videos of peoples houses being exploded in Ukraine and then seeing videos of lgbtq+ people crying and worrying about the kids in Florida and Texas like it’s so much all at once and I just wish we could all be safe and not be in fear of our rights being taken away even more and literally dying
I 100% agree why should we only focus on the good like these are real things happening and we can’t keep ignoring it because that’s never worked like Ukraine is being attacked and we’re on the brink of WW3 and the rights of children and there safety are getting taken and the rates of suicide will only get higher and it’s heartbreaking
I might as well get one too
Sadly I’m 17 and haven’t been able to get a job because of medical reasons so I can’t donate even though I want to so I’m trying to share many posts from those from in Ukraine to those who can donate and who have a louder voice then me because I’m the eyes of anyone else I’m just a kid and I don’t know what I’m talking about and I shouldn’t worry but I am worried because it may not be effecting me but other people are being effected and I just wish this was just a nightmare and everyone in Ukraine was safe and alright but it’s not and overall the world has gone to shit this year
Please don't take this the wrong way, but you're clearly showing your age.

When I was growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, LGBTQ+ folk weren't accepted at many ""normal"" bars, even in Liberal NJ. Most states still had sodomy laws on the books. If you came out in HS you were probably going to get beat up if not horrifically taunted by your classmates. Being trans was considered a mental illness by the medical authorities that write the books. Coming out as such would cost you your job and possibly residence. Again, this was all in solidly blue central NJ. It was a hundred times worse in deep red states.

Now, most states include sexual orientation and gender identity in their anti-discrimination laws. ""Gay bars"" are dying because we're accepted pretty much anywhere. I, as a police officer, am welcomed by my department and 90% of my co workers. It's no longer a criminal offense to be LGBTQ+.

And you know what? 20 years before that it was even worse... The Stonewall Riots, over the fact that gay bars could even exist, were only just over 50 years ago. Even in super-liberal NYC, the NYPD had a ""public morals squad"" whose sole job was to suppress expression of LBGTQ+ people and values.

Yes, suicide rates are higher now, but that's across the board when it comes to youth, not just LGBTQ+ people.

I'm not trying to minimize the shittiness of these actions that FL and TX is taking; yeah these are bad and will cause a lot of harm if they continue to exist as proposed.

But overall, in the US, things are universally, factually better for LGBTQ+ people than any time in our history.
There's tons of good things happening in the world that don't receive news coverage. You aren't letting down anyone by focusing on the good things for a while for your own mental health. 

That being said fuck Abbot and Putin lmao
Exactly, This may sound rude of me to say but I honestly dont have much respect for people that say ""oh dont focus on the bad stuff rn just focus on the good"" because what that does is minimize the effects of said situation.

Turning a blind eye to Ukraine because ""oh we shouldnt focus on that, we should just focus on the good stuff happening rn in our country"" is just a stupid, shitty thing to do. Those are millions of lives at stake, a whole ass country/location being invaded and attacked, why the hell would you tell people not to focus on that and to not be afraid of what this means for the world? 

The world is quite literally on the brink of World War 3, all it takes is one single decision to be made and this world gets thrown into chaos, it wont just be Ukrainian lives being lost, but lives of many countries being thrown away for a war.

Russia aka Putin needs to know that the world is watching, and that the world is on Ukraines side, This is a situation that can very easily effect the entire fucking world. And if we go into World War 3, it'll the scariest time alive because this time many countries have nuclear weapons, and in war each side will be itching to overpower the other side, and Putin has made vague threats in regards to resorting to nuclear weapons this time around.

This isnt a time to be like ""oh dont pay attention to that scary stuff, instead pay attention to these good little puppies and kitties over here""
Look at that! You are doing something! I underestimated you. I think you know what you're talking. Being 17 doesn't mean you're wrong at all. It's just that I spent a lot of my life buried in fear and hopelessness. I've seen a lot of people get buried by it, too. It traps you if you don't fight it, and it doesn't help you to be weighed down by it. A positive attitude can do a world of good, but you have to build it, it won't just happen. You have to find the beauty in the world around you, and help it shine through. You're already doing that, and I think you deserve the rewards: optimism, satisfaction, and self-esteem. You make a difference in people's lives everyday, in ways you'll never see. Trust that it's there. The good things that happen in our lives aren't accidents, they're the efforts of people just like you making it possible.
Yeah plus it’s disrespectful and insensitive of those going through the invasion in Ukraine and everyone wants to turn a blind eye to everything like it’s nothing when it’s the most heartbreaking thing of the new year
Yeah I can't help but to cry everytime I hear or see a video showing whats happening in Ukraine, my heart just bleeds for them.

But Ukraine is tough, and their soldiers and citizens are becoming hero's. 

The world will not forget the bravery and courage that these people defending their homes and country have done.

Theres a recording of a russian naval ship telling an island of 13 Ukrainian soldiers to bow down and give up and if they don't they will fire upon the island.. and those Ukranian soldiers stood their ground bravely and told that Russian ship to go fuck themselves. All 13 of those brave soldiers died, but they died a hero standing and defending their country.

Then theres the Ukranian soldier who mined a bridge to slow down/halt russian advancement, he couldnt get off the bridge so he blew the bridge and himself up, a heros death, sacrificing himself to defend his home, his country and the capital of Ukraine and all the innocent civilians.

Turning a blind eye to the ""bad events happening"" is turning a blind eye to the heros and bravery
Yeah and the videos of fathers kissing there kids and hugging them for probably the last time is heartbreaking because yes there defending there home but it’s shattering to know that families are losing who they love during these times and my heart goes out to those out fighting and those who are seeking safety and hiding from the explosions
Its just awful whats happening, and I just hope any Ukranians in this sub know that we and the workd stand with them, and applaud their bravery.

Ukraine is a much braver country then the U.S, The Ukranian president is staying in the capital and helping the citizens as best as he possibly can, and doing all he can for his homeland... Meanwhile Senator Ted Cruz of Texas fled Texas because of power grid issues.

I hold so much love and respect for Ukraine, I just wish.. that this situation never happened

A sad day for trans people in Germany	"Yesterday the German government declined a proposed law that would allow for self ID for trans people and finally stop the 40yo law that forces us to go through court and provide two certificates from independent appraisers (which you also have to pay for yourself). Those appraisers often make sure you are ""trans enough"" by asking about your sexuality or things like ""What kind of underwear are you wearing?"".
And that's for only a change of name and gender marker."	"It's spreading! Several States in the US have been passing laws preventing trans people from getting their hormones and surgeries and allow healthcare providers to discriminate against us. Keep pushing! We're pushing along with you!
The Arguments were soo dumb...
The conservative Party said its in the interest of the gouvernment is to ""keep valid Gender characteristics"" and  said that Hormone therapys with ""children"" are ""experiments with children"" the Right-wing party talked about bottom surgery and thats something Teens cant decide at theyre own (no one talked about bottom surgery, just names and the gender noted in documents) and the second coalition party (there is nothing more left to describe em') wheren't 100% ok and suggested something the other coalition member (the conservatives) dindn't want.
Im so upset, like.. i dindn't had great expectations but still its so old and stupid
That's why you should definitely look for a therapist, the right therapist.

For example, my therapist knows there's no such thing as being ""trans enough"" and will evaluate based on other factors, such as how you would feel if you got one, etc. 

Insurance pays for therapy anyways, so make sure you get the right one.


Edit: the therapist can make a note (""Begutachten""), which you can do a lot with
Oh wow I had no idea Germany was so bad with that kind of stuff. I'm so sorry you're dealing with the same kinds of transphobia we deal with in the States. But we're wishing you all the best and hopefully things get better for yall in time.
Germany seems to be going back about 80 years, what was that one guy with the funny mustache?
http://chng.it/4NdSGyGnmF
Oh my god, the same happened a few days ago here in Spain. Trans people have to go through 2 years of hrt even if they don't want it and several psychological exams that are basically traumatic (they have to diagnose you with dysphoria as if you were sick). The worst thing is that this came from a supposedly left-wing party that ""supports"" us. I just hope some day we'll be seen as people and not political tools
the worlds still going backwards in some places.. its horrible :/
Sorry for my German Text:

Ich wurde nur über meinen Lebenslauf gefragt. Also seit wann bin ich trans, wie lief es bis jetzt so mit der Entwicklung. Also was ich trage war nie Thema. Also in den Gutachten. 

Bei der Namensänderung wurde ich final nur noch einmal final gefragt ob ich meinen neuen Namen annehmen will. 

Keine Frage. Es gibt echt gemeine Gutachter. Aber wenn man sich die wählen/empfehlen lässt ist die Gefahr sehr gering. Es werden nämlich immer die gleichen genommen die schon viel Erfahrung haben.

Das man die zwei Gutachten bezahlen muss finde ich aber auch Mist. Du kannst übrigens immer eine Verfahrenskostenhilfe beantragen. Damit musst du nur noch ein Bruchteil bezahlen. Da ich das Geld hatte habe ich davon nichts beansprucht fairer Weise. Bezahlt habe ich knapp 1200€ für beide Gutachten und den endgültigen Bescheid. (Bin Berufstätig)
If you come to California, they have laws that prevent people from being denied transgender care. This state is extremely tolerant of people from any background.
I pray this dosnt spread to the netherlands
At least the Grünen are gaining in popularity, so hopefully in the next years this will finally get changed.
[removed]
We are kinda lucky to have more parties available at elections than you. Since along the declining parties almost everyone voted against it, (despite waving pride flags on the IDAHOBIT on monday) we now know who to NOT vote at the elections this year.
The US is still lightyears ahead of nearly every other country in terms of trans care
Don't even listen to those from the AfD, they also called us pigs when they thought nobody would listen (but one did and called them out which I was really happy about)

Still the debate was so filled with transphobia, it hurt so much listening to that crap...

But the draft actually stated that bottom surgery would actually be permitted from the age of 14 as long as the child/teen and either the parents or the ""Familiengericht"" also agree.
Ah, Sorry, no, I know that. I've got my ""Indikation"" already, so I just need some check ups and then I'm ready to go for E.

But for a change of name and gender marker it's more difficult than medical transition. That was what I meant.
Well, at least the medical side is okay-ish. So you guys still got it worse than we do. Still, thank you for your support! Sending love to y'all over there, too. ❤️
That is a bit overstated. The whole position to trans people is changing - to the positive. Many therapists follow state of the art recommendations, it's only that politics are very slow in germany and it takes some time till they get what the people want. 
And it's election year, so the christian mid-conservative party (who is mostly elected by 60+ year old people) won't do smth revolutionary to scare them off.
Their coalition partner don't wants the media attention, cause they are already very unpopular which lead to this decision...but it's election year and from september on there will be at least one party in the government, that supported this law
Good idea. Already signed it. But good for everyone here who didn't know of this yet.
Love to y'all Spanish siblings! We will get through this. In September we have federal elections and as far as polls go, one of the two parties that proposed a self ID law could become the second most voted party which would give them a lot more control over this. And maybe we can expect a self ID law after that (or at least hope for one) and if Germany has one, their political influence inside the EU could get some people in other EU countries thinking. Let's just hope for the best.
Das ist ja wenigstens ein Trost, dass es immerhin Gutachter und Richter gibt, die mit der Zeit mitgegangen sind. Trotzdem wäre so ein Gesetz ein wichtiges Zeichen zur Entstigmatisierung gewesen.
If that was sarcasm, I want to tell you that you should make it more clear since text alone is very unsuitable for conveying sarcasm reliably.
If it wasn't sarcasm: Why are on a trans subreddit if you're a Transphobe?
And one of the parties that pushed for a new transgender law might be the winner of the election this fall. This is good news.
That may be true, but all that progress is in danger of being reversed. Just because we have it better than most is no reason to be complacent. We must remain vigilant for ourselves and trans people around the world. Otherwise we will lose all that progress and who knows how long it'll take us to get it back.
Afd are the fascist party no?
oh didnt know that, thanks.
Me and a Friend did an big exam (MSA) about it just a few hours before they debated... I cried reading about it
Nice! 

Oh, maybe I should ask again, because as far as I know the indication is actually easier to get, mainly because you've had more sessions for the therapist to evaluate (18 months, as far as as I know, please correct me if Ii wrong)
It was an ill attempt at humour
Yes! I got all my friends and family to sign it too!
That's really good! We don't have elections until 2023, but honestly we're kinda going backwards right now, so I'd rather wait until then than having a right-wing party win (our ""socialist"" and ""left-wing"" government is almost letting the country run itself, so other right-wing parties are taking advantage of the situation to appeal more to the people). But like you said, let's hope for the best. We'll get through this! 💕
Da gebe ich dir 100% Recht.
We can hope for the best
Yep
yes they are. Right-wing(-conservative) pigs. (Famous for Anti-feminism, Homo/Trans/Xenophobia, Holocaust reletivations, Nationalism, Racism, Neo-Nazi-Stuff...)
I listened to it all. It really was sickening. Especially how energetic Beatrice von Weidel was when she repeatedly insulted us.
It is. For the indication, all that's needed is a therapist that basically says ""Yep, they're trans."" The minimum length of the therapy is a myth because it was recommended (bzw actually even outdated, but that's another story) to have a minimum length. Not a requirement, a recommendation. But somehow most therapists took that very serious.
If your therapist is willing to give you an indication, they can do so whenever they feel fit.

For the ""Namensänderung/Personenstandsänderung"" it sadly is the arduous process I described in the original post. And yesterday it could have been changed to a law that would have gotten rid of these disgusting assessments.
Oh sorry, i'm german you know what the clichè says
I exactly know that situation. We actually have a right wing party in our government right now (with a not even small percentage) and they constantly behave like drunkards in a bar. Yesterday among their seats, they literally threw words like ""pigs"" around during the debate around trans people. Luckily one woman from a ""neighboring"" party heard that and openly called them out for everyone in the room and live stream to hear.
So you mean to tell me trans people aren't allowed to undergo the operation that changes their gender
Probably all have parents related by blood.
you mean Storch? I just saw it... pretty cool that she don't even thaught about the Trans* people who would recieve a lot from this Law. Guess instead we stay with whataboutism and 40yo laws
For me things are different anyways, since I'm not 18 yet. But last September they changed a lot, for example now you need 6 months with n sessions (don't remeber how many, think it was 12)

This year a lot will change, anyways. With the new ICD-11 and annual re-something in September.
Oof that's horrible. A few months we had a deputy talking about the crisis we're going through right now in the public health system since there isn't enough attention to mental health and a guy yelled ""oh come on, go to a shrink!"" to him from his seat. Still waiting for politicians to start having a minimum respect for each other and the people they're supposed to help
It's even more ridiculous. It's easier for us to get on hormones and get surgeries than to change our name.
Whoops, confused those two names. Yes, meant von Storch xD
Yes, that's true.
But as I said, it's actually a recommendation, not a strict requirement. If you therapist think's it's be okay to give you an indication, they're free to do so. I got mine after about 4-5 months.
A few months ago*
Yes. We all call ourselves democratic, like in ""all power lies within the people"". But as long as some politians can't even respect the people, those don't have power. Only the politicians do.
Yea wtf
Isn't that kind of more important?
They are both fascist, non-charismatic, anti-feminist, conservative women without any ethic.
So, very easy to mix them up haha
I don’t know what to think about Alice Weidel. She is lesbian and against human rights.
I completely agree but would also add that in Spain we have a royal family that gets 500.000€ a year for doing absolutely nothing and the constitution says that offending them is a crime so... It gets even worse knowing there isn't a single party represented in the Congress that's willing to change that 😩
Yes, I am glad that it isn't as complicated as a name change. It's just ironic.
That's true xD

Is it okay if i never want to tell anyone i’m trans my entire life?	"
Im a girl. i transitioned early and i’m certain i could pass with little effort . i’ll get bottom surgery and laser hair removal once i’m 18. what’s the problem with me cutting off how i used to be? cis people are allowed to cut off how they were as a child so why can’t i? i’m scared i’ll never find true love or be treated differently for being trans, so why can’t i just not ever ever tell anyone? i’m sad. i’ve already missed out on middle and high school because i’m trans, but i finally want to have friends in university

Edit: thank you to everyone who answered and listened to my concerns💗. i have made up my mind that i’m gonna live like a cis girl and only tell long term romantic partners or trans safe spaces"	"Yes its fine? You do what you feel you need to do hun!
I felt this way when I first came out. I swear I went to great lengths to make sure people who hadn’t known me prior to coming out, would never know the old me. But eventually the act becomes exhausting. I eventually realized that (personally) the reason I tried to hard to keep it a secret was because of my own internalized transphobia, mixed with the anxiety and fear that people would treat me differently if they knew. A more realistic outlook is that- there’s always going to be ignorant people who *will* probably make ur life difficult at some point, that’s just the trans experience unfortunately. But there’s also other awesome fucking trans people (and cis Ppl who actually get it) who can give you confidence in the fact that being trans is fucking awesome and fun and self fulfilling! It is absolutely up to you, and I hope no one pressures you one way or another, but in my personal opinion, being out and unapologetically proud about it is a lot of fucking fun (p.s. I hope someone can make you feel comfortable and proud about being trans one day, it sounds like you’ve gotten a lot of shit in the past that you don’t deserve💕)
Imho, not everyone needs to know, but if you're planning on getting serious with someone you should probably let them know. For your safety
I had a go at that, lasted about 14 years, was quite good. It is definitely possible, especially as you are starting younger. But, just be a little bit aware that you might be cutting off part of you that is important to your wellness. Good luck
Trans guy here, honestly if you are in a long term relationship with someone I would tell them, for your safety and respect for them, but for example friends or room mates do not need to be told if you feel like you wouldn't want to.
do what you want, there aint no police stoppin you
Honestly you should probably still tell your partner. It’s for your own safety
Of course it's okay! I love openly trans people because it makes me feel like I'm not alone out there, but it's up to each person to share or not, and you're not wrong for wanting to keep it private.
You don’t have to tell anyone, but if it’s a potential romantic/sexual partner then you should let them know. A lot of people (even allies/other trans ppl) may not want to date a trans person and can feel like their trust is betrayed or that they’ve been tricked into dating outside of their preference. 

!!This does not mean that you purposefully meant to make them feel like this, it just means that not telling them can cause issues between you two!! 

I totally understand not wanting to think or talk about that part of your past, but sometimes it is necessary to let someone know.

Also while dating someone as a trans person is already dangerous, it can be even more dangerous if someone finds out they’ve been dating a trans person instead of being told at the beginning. For your safety, you should let romantic/sexual partners know.
I have a friend who plans on going zero contact with everyone in her life soon. A few exceptions with her queer friends. 

I honestly get it. Once I pass, I would be seriously tempted to move across the planet and start a new life. Not sure I could, but respect for those that do, out of desire or out of necessity.
i think that is absolutely fine! the one thing i'd say is that if you plan to have any sexual relations before getting bottom surgery, i would err on the side of caution and definitely let your partners know for your own safety (y'know, gay panic defense and all that). but other than that, if you think it's impossible to tell that you're trans, you have every right to that privacy! <3 good luck
Yep
Yes
You shouldn't want to be around people who would treat a person differently after learning they're trans, no matter who it is. Hiding it for safety is normal and fine, but when it comes to friends or family, do you really want to hang out with or marry someone who would be transphobic to others? Could you stand hearing that, even though it isn't directed at you?
Only tell someone if you feel safe to do so. It’s not a requirement at all to disclose being trans
I barely tell people I’m trans since transitioning last year. I pass as cis and use it to an advantage so I don’t always have to out myself. I tell people when I want to
Well if you're getting the surgery then I don't see why not.
Literally doesn’t matter. If you pass fine then there’s no danger, the only people I’d be wary of are those who knew you before you transitioned but, if they’re supportive, that shouldn’t be a problem
That's totally fine! Loads of trans folks never mention the fact. Heck, I myself have done effectively the same thing, only outright telling maybe two people outside of my family. So yeah you're gonna be fine in not telling anyone ever
If you can, and that’s what you want, then great!
I guess maybe to set an example for young trans kids in the future? If all the trans people disappear into society without a trace then young trans people have no role models to look up to, no way of knowing what their future could be like. That's the way it was for me as a kid. I had no idea what it was too be transgender I thought it was just a fantasy that I had, and that not fitting in with the guys just came down to my personality. Even when I did learn what it was too be trans in my 20s the only people I ever saw were the ones who couldn't hide it. The ones who transitioned later in life and couldn't go stealth as they would never pass. Anyone who did transition young never told a soul, so in my mind they didn't exist. It terrified me and made me stay in the closet far longer than I should have.

I'm not saying this is your responsibility, and if you don't want to that's perfectly fine just something to keep in mind.
Do what you feel best with. Just find a good explanation for why you can’t have a child **if you fall in love with someone who does want a child**. Of course, you can always opt for adoption…
im doing the same thing, but i didnt transition early, im just existing as myself
it's perfectly okay!
I have a few thoughts on this. 

1. I think that, ideally, no, you shouldn't be obligated to disclose this to anyone. It's your story, your life, you get to choose who you share it with, if anyone. 

2. I think that being able to share this part of yourself can be extremely helpful with close friends or partners because it allows them to better understand you and what you've gone through, or even what you're going through, even if people gender you as female 100% of the time. It can explain why someone accidentally misgendering you impacted you so much more deeply than it does cis people (because they get misgendered too, they just don't care as much because they don't have people questioning their identity constantly).

3. I think that being out and proud as a trans person, though incredibly difficult, is so extremely important and rewarding in terms of forwarding our community's cause. Being proud to be trans normalizes it for those who aren't used to the idea. It also allows trans youth to see that it is ok to be who they are. 

4. Most importantly, you must guard your own life. Your safety is more important that keeping this hidden. Even if you are gendered female 100% of the time, have breasts and a vulva, your ID has an F on it, etc., people can still someone find out. When people, especially men, and especially someone you're romantically involved with, do find out, they can often react with aggression, anger, and violence. We have been beaten and murdered for this countless times. It is so important that you keep yourself safe. I know how strong the desire to just be unclockable, to be like any other girl, is, but it's not more important than your life. I hope whoever you end up with has absolutely no problem with it, that you get to tell them or not tell them however you decide, that you meet someone who would never hurt you. This is unfortunately not the reality a lot of the time in our community.
One thing I’ve found very comforting recently is the logical argument that there is no way to get an “ought” from an “is.” You *are* trans, but there is nothing you *ought* to do that necessarily follows from simply being trans. You have no obligation to tell people you are trans. Sexual partners I’d strongly recommend being transparent with because if it ever comes up later on and a partner or former partner is not ok with that, it can cause all kinds of problems (some quite dangerous even) that could have been avoided. When it comes to my own preference here, as a post op trans woman, even in the case of a one night stand, I’d rather not share my body with someone who would have a problem with me being trans. If they can’t handle the knowledge I used to have a dick, they don’t get to be anywhere near what I got now.

On a semi related note, while living in stealth is very appropriate and even necessary for some circumstances, it does bar you from interacting with the wider queer community. It can be truly wonderful to be able to openly talk about shared experiences with other trans people. Furthermore, building relationships within the community doesn’t require giving up or hiding part of who you are. People knowing you’re trans of course doesn’t require you talk about your AGAB or anything before you came out either, but you don’t have to waste time and energy appeasing cis people or trying to be seen a certain way by them.
My cousin is trans and no one outside of the family knows. And he will not say anything about his process. It’s their choice to not share any of those. And it should be respected as well
You'd be surprised how many ppl rlly don't care what u do
Of course you don't need to tell anyone if you don't want to. I would caution you that if you want a partner through life that it would probably be best to let them know even though being transgender is just a minor thing that you don't want to think about it. If they find out things might go poorly because they think that you don't trust them. Building trust after it has been broken can be a difficult thing.

If I were in your situation I would tell a significant other around the getting to know the deeper parts of you portion of the relationship. If I were the kind of woman who had intercourse before marriage (I am not) I would tell them a few days before that point. I would tell my significant other very shortly after proposal if asked or before asking if the one proposing. Other then my significant other I wouldn't tell anyone in your case if I felt the way you are thinking.

I personally don't advertise the fact that I am transgender but I am not exactly hiding it either. I do things that I might not have done otherwise in isolation to blend in and influence others to see me the way I want to be seen. If people I know want to ask questions in good faith I give them good faith answers.

I am lucky to pass as well as I do with starting transitioning at 33 with several things that were working against me. Since February of this year the only time I have been clocked by strangers is when my 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl do the daddy, daddy, daddy thing that young children are want to do.
You don't have to tell anyone you are trans. That said, we all have a few people we want to share everything with. People we feel safe telling our deeper secrets. I don't think you should keep it secrets from those closest friends.
it’s YOUR life. if you want to feel happy and forget about past trauma, go for it. i don’t know why pride is always associated with being ‘out,’ tbh being proud of yourself is just as valid. it’s about being seen, how you’d like to be seen.
I mean do whatever the fuck you want.  I think it's a little weird if you'd want to tell people explicitly that you're cis (to be fair I usually promote lying to cis people who intentionally pry to bring you down). There are lots of cis allies who use the line of ""maybe I'm trans,  maybe I'm not,  does it matter?"" And I feel like if you pass so undoubtedly it would be an excellent opportunity for you.
thank you for listening to me
And for their knowledge. Respect works both ways ofc ❤️
but that’s the problem. i wanna move away from the people who knew me pre-transition and not tell anyone at all no matter what and live my life without prejudice. what if they see me differently after i tell them?
If I passed 100% of the time I wouldn't be open the way I am now. I can't really fathom how wonderful that must feel to not have to worry all the time.
I don't think preemptively coming up with lies to tell your life partner is the foundation for a healthy and trusting relationship.
This is probably a annoying thing to say but it is true, if someone sees you differently after you tell them you aren't cis-gender do you really want them to be a major contribution in your life? is that who you would want to be accosiated with? I'm out in my high school which has 3000+ students and there is very few that doesn't except me and they still respect me and my wishes. Personally, if  I was you I'd move and not tell anyone, but if you are in a relationship (sexual or romantic) I would say out of respect they deserve to be told. Not anything about your past or anything about you pre-transition but that you are transgender.
Yeah and what about when you have a serious partner? The reality is that anyone you’re going to spend your life with is somebody that you should be comfortable telling *anything* to. 

You’re going to have to deal with administering hormones. You’re not going to be able to hide it. Not forever at least. And regardless of how long you can keep it a secret, it’s still basically lying through omission. And a relationship without honesty is doomed to fail. That one omission will shatter trust and it’ll be downhill from there. 

Am I saying it should be the first thing you say? Nah. But really there is nothing good that will come from trying to hide it lest you want a very lonely life."	xbcszf	trans	220	0.99	2022-09-11 08:05:30

It pisses me off when spouses use kids as leverage to keep trans people from being ourselves. Your five year old won't care. At all. All he wants is to be loved.

Melissa, don't worry too much about what that mirror is saying to you. I was where you are not so very long ago. HRT and laser.. and maybe a wig if you need one.. they will start to bring *her* out faster than you might believe.

Don't despair, *she* will appear.

You can DM if you need to.
Sending love, support and solidarity ❤️🖤
hello, Melissa. you are not hideous, you are a lovely woman, i am sure. very soon, you will be able to look just the way you want to- like your beautiful self, the version of Melissa that you deeply desire to look like. very soon, you will get the chance to be yourself, i assure you. 

the fact that your ex-wife is leaving you is already a good sign- you are now free from a person who regulates you and forces you to hide your true self. you will no longer have to hide who you are, very soon you can be yourself. and your kids will eventually and definitely find out about you being a woman (kids are very curious like that, isnt it?) and will love you. dont you worry miss, it will all be okay. :)
I'm sorry Melissa - you deserve all the good things in life. Keep your head up, girl.
Please be kind to yourself in all this. The nurturer in me wants to just give you a huge hug. It's also totally okay to cry because this is hard. 

All hail Melissa!
I am truly sorry for your situation. As a fellow driver I would focus on time with your kids.
I’m young in my journey (FtM) myself so I still struggle with these thoughts. But all I can say is you are NOT hideous, you are beautiful. All women look different and you are coming to your own. I’m so sorry you feel like you have to hide and I wish I could give you a big hug.
A kind word

But in all seriousness. You are allowed to tell your kids. Like others have said. Kids nowadays will be more accepting. You’ll be able to be that gorgeous woman on the outside like how are on the inside, Melissa. Don’t worry

The ex is determined to think he will have problems with it hense the counselor which she's not all that interested in getting
>It pisses me off when spouses use kids as leverage to keep trans people from being ourselves. Your five year old won't care. At all. All he wants is to be loved.

So much this. ""But how will the kids understand?"" They'll understand just fine, Karen. You're projecting your own prejudices onto them.
Thanks for the kind words
Thank you. I'm trying but life is hard sometimes
Mmm trolls just validate who I am. I'm a woman your a troll have fun
It's clear who has the problem here and it's not the child...
Kids brains are still developing, so when you explain something like daddy is a mommy now they understand. When I told my 12 y/o brother he was just like ""cool I have a sister now"" your ex is the one who can't accept you. Girl you are beautiful no matter what she says, also side note girl truckers are hella badass and cool.
I would be so tempted to hardline her, saying you need to be yourself and if she won't help me tell the kid then I'll do it myself.
 
What's she doing to do? Divorce you? Be transphobic?
Of course, friend 😊
Yea she having trouble coming to terms and feels lied to
Thanks. I agree that's how I feel it will go. He doesn't even have to stop calling me daddy it won't hurt me I love my kids unconditionally. 

 my hero is one of our flatbed drivers, flatbed trucking woman have to be badass and cool. She does tiktoks on the road too
divorce started before I came out and gave me a chance to see who I was, we still deal closely with each other I'm basically still living with her when not out driving on the truck. She feels lied to (join the club I lied to myself for years) and is trying to come to terms still.
Which is valid, but how she's treating the situation will help precisely no one.
Agreed....we decided to get divorced in August we still haven't talked to the kids yet....yea she likes avoiding these problems"	tk2ljm	trans	212	0.98	2022-03-22 13:06:31
why do so many of us trans people love cuddles	"i do, and i'd say 95% of the people on this subreddit do. why do we love cuddles?

edit:as mentioned in the post, i love cuddles as well but i have no one to cuddle with irl and it makes me sad☹️ I'm stuck cuddling my stuffed sloth which is nice to cuddle with and all but an actual human would be way better to cuddle with"	"Touch starved
We crave real love in a world that does not seem to love us. :’(
Most people like cuddles. So it makes sense that most trans people do as well. And, as other commenters have mentioned, a fair number of us are probably touch starved as well.
[deleted]
It's a physical form of acceptance.
My girlfriend says that I give the *best* cuddles. 
I keep trying to tell her that she's the best cuddlee.
Everyone loves cuddles, unless you are aro or aroace thats just how it is, cuddles are great.

Edit: asensual not aro or aroace
I thought this was just me… I’ve never rlly felt “loved” or wanted to might be that
I don’t know really. I just love giving hugs and cuddles that are as comfy as possible. Never thought about the reason
Honestly, I don’t get it. Obviously do what makes you happy but I can’t stand being touched.
there's just something so intimate and pure about cuddling.  The only time I've ever felt 100% accepted and safe is when my partner holds me tenderly and we just lay in silence listening to each other breathe.
Ouch ...group hug❤️‍🩹
Because most people love cuddles, but are conditioned to believe we shouldn’t.
Who is Cuddles?  Is that the bear from the fabric softener?
I mean I don't but that's because I have sensory issues with soft, subtle touch for an extended amount of time. plus I'm aroace so touch isn't really welcome for me. If someone touched me while I was in the middle of a breakdown it would honestly make my breakdown worse. I prefer baggy clothes, blankets and stuffed animals to touch. Also random proclamations of love is weird to me. I'd rather feel it through actions and gifts. When people say ily to me usually it's followed by them wanting to ruin our perfectly awesome platonic relationship to confess 😐

But it is common for trans people to be touch starved. Esp because trans people are more likely to have issues getting a committed, faithful partner, that won't use trans people for weird fetishes.
A lot of valid points made in this thread. My 2c is from mtf perspective so won't apply to everyone, but for me a big part of it was the ridiculously narrow confines of toxic masculinity growing up. Even complimenting a male friend was taboo, let alone a hug unless something extreme had just happened like a death in the family or something. Generally showing any platonic affection was an excuse to be ostracized, so now that I'm out and have friends that aren't so paranoid about it I take every chance I get to give hugs!
My last hug was 6 years ago... so...
Probably touch starvation and neglect or abuse since trans people are way too prone to that.

I'm fairly certain everyone likes cuddles, and if someone were to tell me they don't, I probably wouldn't believe them, lol.

In reality, and I can't speak for everyone, but I myself am just extremely touch starved. I imagine alot of us are. Especially living in a world that tends not to love us, if not actively hate us.

 It's rough, but don't give up, we'll get there. Wishing all of y'all best love and cuddles❤️
*Everyone* loves cuddles, but like other gendered parts of the life, lots of people feel compelled to pretend that they don't.  It is a small thing to deny yourself, and once we accept that we are trans and start trying to piece together who we really are separately from the expectations we inherit because of who we *appear* to be, it becomes as easy thing to allow ourselves, too.
Cuddles are just great, Idk...
[removed]
Definitely
Gods I absolutely love cuddles and miss them. 😭😢
Doesnt everyone love cuddles? I am Ace myself so i especially like them, its the nost intimate thing I take part in. but ive never known someone who doesnt like to cuddle
Our changed perspective makes us more sensitive to feelings and touch than we were before.
I've never heard of this being a thing but I've always loved cuddles 🥺 my love language is physical touch and quality time
I use to love to cuddle before but with testosterone always had the sex crap in my mind and now oh my the level of loving cuddling now is crazy! It’s in a diff way for sure now but without even caring if sex is happening or not.
Someone else said this but I think it’s because we’re all touch starved. Like, *seriously though, having someone to cuddle with would be perfect, wouldn’t it?*
Because I want what I can never have

Curse you touch starvation, skin hunger, loneliness!
I'm lucky. I live with 2 dogs who love cuddles. And if I'm not at home, I'm house-sitting for friends who also have 2 dogs who love cuddles. Being the big spoon is awesome.
I'm aromantic but I'm touch starved so plutonic cuddles👌
As AMAB I've experienced life with T, life with E, back to T, and back to E (many cycles of suppression, acceptance, suppression, acceptance) and I can confidently say that E makes a person much more wanting of cuddles. Before I started HRT I didn't really care for cuddling, but while on E it was the greatest thing on Earth.
I just have a desire to feel safe and loved. Cuddling is something you do with someone you care about and trust. Lot of times I just want to feel that feeling again. Safety. Security.
Me too…
I don't like beeing touched in every way
acceptance
Idk but yeah I love cuddles
i have a hard time showing affection to people who I don't know but when I make an attachment I feel safe
Definitely touch starved
Makes me feel better i do it to mom a lot she just smiles at me 🤗🤗
Do cis people not like cuddles?
i have an online bf (lives in canada) and me and him just like have vcs at night where we're being cute together and basically just having e-cuddles
Isn't that just everyone in general?
Do you mean from a significant other, or random people? Former is try for mostly everyone. 

For the latter, I've found that true for younger people that tend to be not feeling a place to exist comfortably in the world. This is my observation from going to a lot of nerdy cons (anime, comic, even.... furry) there seems to be a specific type that is all about the random person cuddle pile.
Check out cuddlecomfort.com. Some of the people are paid professional cuddlers, but others are just people like you that want a platonic cuddle partner. There are other websites too, but this is a growing trend.
For me it's 100% being touch starved but also being too uncomfortable with my body for most people to touch me so instead I'm just constantly craving cuddles from close friends (and my boyfriend)
Probably anxiety related I'm an anxious little shit
Personally, touch starved. 

But also, I didn't like the idea of physical contact for a long time because I felt gross and dysphoric. Now I have more self respect/esteem I'm much more ready to enter the mysterious world of cuddling.
I'm not trans but my girlfriend is. Her primary love languages are physical touch and quality time, so the fact that she *adores* cuddling is no surprise to me. There is a certain way that I hold her that she has said makes her feel ""small"" (in a size sense, not belittling, if that makes sense). She's a taller woman, and while she has said before that her height doesn't give her dysphoria, I sometimes wonder if it does, and that being held in that way gives her comfort from that.

Needless to say, whenever we cuddle, she gets held in that specific way. And her comment never fails to cross my mind.
Yeah I do love cuddles to. And I also don’t have anyone to cuddle with me. Except for one really supportive non-binary person who I can share all my thoughts with (especially around gender, of course). Which is great.
So true
Why you gotta call me out like that
lol. Put them on blast like that.
Can confirm.
Sadly this ☝️is the right answer. 

That and sometimes sex is difficult between the ears using the “wrong” apparatus.
Well goodnight to you too! 😋 Rude to tell us the truth like that!
My theory. People subconsciously notice that we're different and avoid physical contact cause we're ""weird""
Ouch... Your not wrong tho
Ye... that would make sense and explain alot about me
Then why did I love cuddles when the world didn't hate me
I think people who could get cuddles when we they want take them for granted.
... a lot of my friends have similar mental health issues, but most of them hate cuddles... Cuddles are the best!
here, take this hug 

*hugs*
This. You can see and feel it, so it feels heavier than words. That’s how I see it.
aro people can have sensual attraction (and indeed many people that identify with the oriented aroace label use a form of tertiary attraction like this to convey the idea), I think you mean [asensual](https://lgbta.miraheze.org/wiki/Asensual)

parting my eyebrows with a chainsaw
I actually remember wheb my dad told me to stop kissing and hugging him at like 5 year old, didn't get a hug of him until I was 27 after he started calling me selfish that he later apologised after realising I've just bought them a 50"" TV a new sofa and paid of their credit card debt. 

My mom was quite loving once a month, though.

Also I fucking love cuddles lol
Interesting, I would have said the opposite. We're self-conscious about our bodies so we refuse casual touch. When we find someone we do trust enough to touch, they're like an oasis in a desert.
Very true, sorry that comment i made was very generalised. But then again it wasn’t meant particularly seriously
Fair enough!
This right here!!!   Prior to transition, I never walked around naked and did not like to be touched on my skin.
I would agree, however speaking from experience for me it was probably both."	tvpe70	trans	208	0.92	2022-04-04 01:15:16
Safety!	"Hello everyone, Garrett here!

This is just your reminder to be safe when you bind and to take breaks often!

I sadly had to learn the hard way that you can hurt yourself very easily... But I am fine now and here to remind you that while it may feel good in the mean time the after effects can hurt (a lot) 

Just know you ar perfect the way you are!

Love ya'll ❤"	"Is this supposed to happen with a proper binder?
Oof. Glad you’re okay now!

My son has just started binding and my wife and I have both gently talked to him about doing so safely, and telling him that we’ll make sure to get him properly fitting binders.
This! Esp if you have a bigger chest. I have DDD/F cups and binding for 6 hours a day regularly hurt me bad, to the point I might need shoulder surgery now
I really need a binder, but I have no clue where to find a good one to buy
I've been binding for a month...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

straight.
I used to bind every day, all day, only took it off to sleep or shower but even though I haven’t been binding for months I still experience discomfort with my breathing and chest pain when I move a certain way, is there anything I can do?
It can happen if you wear it wrong. 

Like too long, when you're doing sports, swimming in it etc.
If I am being honest I don't know, I got a very very cheap one (I do not recommend getting cheap ones) and slept in it, I woke up and I was in a lot of pain 😅

Luckily I don't think I broke anything but I'm still a tad sore from that
So happy to see ya'll being supportive of your son, best wishes you ya'll ❤❤
Same, please be cautious with what you buy and don't get a cheap one like I did
The gc2b binders are pretty awesome and do seem to live up to the hype. They even give me decent results, and I have a *tiny* ribcage despite being tall af.

My US bra size should be 30E, if I converted it correctly,  so yeah, I'm an emphasised hourglass. And they get me to look rather flat, which is nice.
No no no no pls stay safe! I have never seen a situation where that ends well TwT
How long is too long, out of curiosity
Yeah, I would make sure you have a quality one, that is very important.

I am MTF so I don't know a lot about binding. But from what I have seen I don't think it should hurt after several hours.
Hell yeah!

I want him to grow up without any of the pain I suffered through. He has dysphoria for sure, but it’s not coupled with the fear and pain of the closet, and never will be.
Ooo- Tysm!
It's alright haha sorry for the scare! It's pretty loose so it doesn't even affect me that much. Thanks though <3
The time I read most is 8hours 
If youre short-breathed or have pain you should put it off sooner though. 
It's also important to take breaks, go to a restroom and maybe take it off for 2-3mins
I would limit binders to a work day of 8 hours maximum each day.  Medically speaking wearing a binder for more than half the day can absolutely cause shifting of ribs and cause health complications over time, especially if the person is developing still (in their teens).

So huggles, be smart and limit your time wearing binders!
8 hours I think is the standard binding time
Sounds like that was the problem then assuming OP slept for more than 8 hours.

Looking into a better binder might still be a good idea.
Yes with binders, quality is important
I am just very stupid to fall asleep in it, I definitely am looking into buying a better one
I wore it for more than 8 hours, and I had massive back pain. Since not needing the binder any more it got soooooo mich better"	ts5njw	trans	209	0.98	2022-03-30 12:47:12
I put on make up to go see my boyfriend and the dysphoria was strong. I can't even today...	"I'm pre everything FtM. Should have added that, sorry!

It was just a little natural lipstick, fake eyelashes and eyeliner since my eyelashes are a light brown and not very visible, and a teeny bit of blush. And I looked like a clown. I cried until the make up ran down my face. I feel horrible. I'm not a woman. I never have been. The one time I want to be, I look like a fool. And I don't have make up wipes and I'm sitting in my bathroom typing this and I'm so sad..."	"Oh no the comments thinking you're MtF...  
I'm really sorry, I understand how you feel. I live with a religious family and I have to present feminine everyday... my sister is also having a wedding soon so you already know I'm gonna have to get dolled up. Fucking hate the feeling so much. It's like I'm trying to fight the urge to rip all my clothes off. Thankfully I think they will let me wear fancy shirt/pants outfits for any house parties we have... nothing to suspect here mom I promise... I just uhhh can't walk in long clothes! Yeah...   
You'll get through <3 I believe in you king
I understand this so much, back in college I let a friend do makeup for me one day because she looked excited. Both her and her friend said I looked beautiful but when I saw myself I felt like a clown. 

I scraped it off as best as possible before my next class and cried the whole time.
Tactical hug incoming
Just realised my mistake I'm really sorry
You are YOU, and that’s always enough no matter what! I’m mtf but I can relate to the feelings. Stay strong and just keep being you! 

And don’t give up on makeup just yet, sometimes it takes a while to find why you like and what works and what doesn’t. Just keep trying and eventually you will find a look that works for you no matter how you want to present!
[deleted]
I’m not sure to understand, why are you wearing makeup as a FtM ? Most M don’t.
We all look odd when we 1st start wearing makeup. Don't beat yourself up. Your basic loves you and probably didn't even notice anything.

There are days when I want to look pretty and ""fem"". Its not often but it happens occasionally.
Yo this reads as a bit gatekeepy though tbh. Makeup has no gender and is for whoever enjoys it.

It's ok to be trans masc right?	I really love the idea of being a boy but sometimes I'll try and convince myself that I could be cis. I'll say 'I'm a woman' out loud to myself to try and make myself believe it but it just makes me feel sad and then when I say 'I'm a boy' it makes me really happy but then I feel kind of guilty. Transphobes talk about masculinity like it's bad and scary but presenting masc just makes me feel warm and happy, I feel really peaceful and I can't imagine hurting anyone with it but I worry I might and I don't want to be bad but I worry that I am	"It is absolutely 100% OK to be trans masc.

What's bad is \_toxic masculinity\_, and you don't have to adapt those parts. You can be strong and handsome, and still be kind and empathetic.
Wow this post made me (ftm) sad. r/ftm is there if you wanna join, plus there’s some other trans masc specific subreddits that might be of interest, if and when you’re ready. (Though of course mixed spaces like this subreddit are for us too!) 

Cis or trans, your masculinity is yours and yours alone. It’s not inherently bad of negative or harmful or hurtful. If you’re worried about being toxic, chances are you wont be imo. What is harmful is other people telling you that there’s only one way to be masc, and that that way is always bad - that’s toxic, and the best cure is usually distancing yourself from those people. If you need or want someone to talk to, feel free to dm me. 

Also - name buddies! My middle name is Elliot 😄
Yes, it's ok to be trans masc.
I know multiple trans masc people IRL.
And they are more than ok, they are brilliant.
yes
of course it’s okay! 
always valid ♥️
There’s this really annoying and incorrect perception that testosterone is the “bad hormone” and I think it leads to some real and unfair stigma around transmasc folks.

It is absolutely okay to be transmasc!
I'm transfem, but I have first hand experience with the the thought process of ""I don't hate my agab that much, I can be cis, it would be so much easier."" It was not easier. It was miserable, it undid all the progress I had made and it led me into some homophobic and transphobic thought patterns as I tried to suppress my own feelings. It doesn't work, trust me. 

And if your worry is that people say men are bad I get it, when I thought I was a man I had similar feelings of guilt and fear about the way people see men. But no one thinks men or masculinity shouldn't exist or are evil per se. (no one reasonable anyway.) If you're the kind of person who's worried about hurting people with masculinity you're probably not the kind of person who would do that except by accident, which can be learned from. It's fine that you're transmasc, it's okay to be a dude, and honestly if girls are complaining about men around you I think that's a pretty good sign they trust you. I know it's easier said than done but do your best not to take it personally. If what they're saying feels like it applies to you then listen and reflect on it, if it sounds like something you would never do then realize they're not talking about you and you have nothing to feel guilty for.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Being masculine only becomes a problem when it becomes toxic or used to bring others down, which doesn't seem to be your goal in all this. If you do come to the conclusion that you're transmasc, I sincerely hope your transition goes swimmingly! \^w\^
Of course it's okay to be trans masc. Masculinity is totally cool. Sometimes people refer to toxic masculinity but that's not referring to masculinity as a whole and you can be really masculine and totally cool.
howdy, i’m  FtM and it’s perfectly okay to be transmasc. I love meeting new transmascs and you’re totally valid and supported. Best of luck.
Yeah dude
It's completely alright to be transmasc!! If you're worried about toxic masculinity, I know how you feel. In the few months or so before I came out as ftm, I kept telling myself that I was really nonbinary because I couldn't be the stereotypical ""alpha male"" that's portrayed in most media. Then I realized I can just... not be that kind of guy. I want to be the shy, awkward nerd that I've always been! Except with facial hair, muscle, and he/him pronouns this time.

You are valid no matter what kind of role you want to fill in life, and do your best to remember that gender **doesn't** equal that role. It's the one thing I wish I could tell myself when I was little. Good luck with what sounds like your first gender crisis, friend. We've all been there :)

**edit: Also remember that you choose your own actions. You won't become toxic unless you choose to be, and from what it sounds like, you're a good person who doesn't want to hurt or threaten anyone. That is all that is going to matter. Your gender and/or transition will not change you so much that you become a toxic person, because that's not who you are in the first place!
It’s abolutely ok to be trans mask! If you like reading you might enjoy “meet cute diary” by Emery Lee. It’s a YA book where the main character is a trans guy who deals with this a bit, but it’s mostly a fun love story
100% perfect lyrics fine to be trans masc!! You be you dude!!! Fuck what other people think!!!
being transmasc is perfectly fine and makes up half of the community, be who you are not something else
It is perfectly fine to be yourself, and if that means being masc, then it is fine to be masc.
I'm transmasc so I might be biased, but yes it's definitely okay!
It is 100% ok and you are valid!
of course  
don't listen to transphobes
Masculinity is just a stereotype that males are expected to live up, and females are expected to avoid.

Assuming that being a man involves harming people is a derogatory and inaccurate stereotype. Most men do not go around doing that.

So, instead of categorising yourself as X or Y in order to feel you are allowed to behave in a certain way, just act however you want to. The benefit being, you don't have to pretend to meet all the other (false) stereotypes.

You are already allowed to just be yourself!

You are happy when you act like yourself, and don't want to copy some behaviours of other people. You already are yourself, you don't need to categorise yourself as anything. Just be you!
Yo dawg. Ofc it’s okay, what the heck ? Masculinity is beautiful. Like, we split human traits into two boxes basically arbitrarily and assigned each box to people based on arbitrary criteria. We virtually all have at least some from each box, humans really don’t fit neatly in two and only two discrete boxes. We virtually all encounter situations where we can make good use of them. But we don’t all mistake « destroying snowflakes with facts and logic omg » for actual stoicism and reason. That’s just masculin-ish apparatus on ridiculous bullshit.

The problem stems from 1) half of the population based on the box they were assigned turned dominant and 2) their means of asserting their dominance very often are a sophisticated combinaison of the traits in their box to turn them harmful. Masculine traits are fine.
I'm transmasc. I was a much more toxic person before accepting that I'm trans and deciding to transition. Turns out that going through life in a state of constant discomfort makes you much more likely to assume the worst about others and respond to people in hurtful ways. Transitioning - and specifically being on T - has made me much chiller, less self centered, and more able to speak honestly about my needs and emotions.
of course it is. there's absolutely nothing wrong with being yourself
Of freaking corse fam
Masculinity isn't inherently toxic but if you're worried about it you should identify the men in your life that have toxic traits (tbf we all do but some are more obvious) and use them as an example of the kind of man you don't want to be. It even helped me curb some toxic behaviours I had before transitioning and we could all use a little more self awareness
i use to affirm that “i’m a woman” too instead of accepting that i was trans. it is 100% ok to be transmasc. you’re not harming anyone by being transmasc. be yourself, its the most lovely thing you can do.
Thank you! I just want to be happy and make other people happy (and finally have some decent pockets)
Well, I pass my previous pockets onto you then lmao
Dude men’s pants are the best pants. The pockets are massive and they fit so comfy. They’re durable and the sizes are so much more standardized. Plus they are so easy and realistic looking to pack with but I don’t know if that’s of any interest to you.

Also button down men’s shirts. I go nuts for those. Men’s shoes. Slacks. I daydream about a full tux (one day, one day). Such euphoria"	qoyik4	trans	199	1.0	2021-11-07 21:39:58

Hi fellow trans family,

I created a fundraiser to raise funds for part of my facial feminisation surgery and I hope you could help me out if possible. Any amount is greatly appreciated, even a share among your friends would work. I hope your international LGBT friends are much more open about transgender healthcare and willing to help me than regular Singaporeans. Thank you so much! ❤️

That sad
Hey sis. You can only if you have undergone SRS and remove the penis and testes. I don't plan on doing that, so it's not legal to change sex. But yea, a friend of mine in UK told me that he has a transwoman friend from Malaysia who successfully seeked asylum in UK and is now a British citizen."	q1dzyn	trans	203	1.0	2021-10-04 20:13:26
A loss	"I know my posts here have been full of positivity, confidence and excitement for the future, but this one is different.  My Gramma passed away yesterday.   Though she was pretty old, and her dementia pretty severe, her physical health was pristine.  She seemed like one of those people who would live forever, for better or worse.  And then I got a call yesterday.  Her kidneys had suddenly failed and she wasn't going to last the day.  Mom and I sat with her until she passed.  I watched her stop breathing.  It wasn't beautiful, or gentle, or profound, or peaceful.  It just slowed and slowed until the next breath never came.  It feels like something in me is deformed, now, painful and wrong and in the face of such a deep wrongness as this, suddenly my trans journey doesn't seem so important anymore.

  The confidence is gone, I woke up today and it just wasn't there.  My brain is like mush and time is dragging so slowly.  It's hard to believe that only a day has passed.  My first HRT appointment last Monday feels a lifetime away.  The whole thing just feels so trivial now.  Only two days ago I felt better than ever before, but watching her die feels like it erased the last five years' worth of progress in one go, like I was living in a fantasy that someone tainted irrevocably, breaking the illusion of hope forever.

  I get my first dose of t on the 24th, and that's all that's keeping me from giving up on my trans journey altogether.  I'm clinging to it desperately, but it feels like it's been months since yesterday, I don't think I can hold onto hope through ten more days like this.  By the time I get there, I'll just be going through the motions and I can't even bring myself to care.

Please no ""encouragement.""  ""It gets better"" makes me want to rip people's heads off.  I just want to be sad and not be alone.

EDIT: Thank you all for the support and kind comments.  I'm all social'd out for the day, so no more individual responses, I just wanted to let any other commenters know that I appreciate their kindness.

EDIT 2, SEVERAL HOURS LATER:  I originally wrote this in response to a specific comment, but decided to copy-paste it here as well since it's so relevant to the post as a whole.
  I think I was still in a bit of shock when I posted this earlier.  I'm connecting with myself a little better now and time is speeding up a bit.  This isn't my first major loss, but this is the first one I've had during a period of emotional growth, and it startled me just how fragile this new version of myself was after such surprising shows of strength and resilience over the past week.  Unlike my last loss, I am in a good place emotionally and I have the tools to make it through, and knowing that I won't have another decade-long grieving cycle is already helping me keep some hope."	"Sweet words. Sorry for your loss.
Sorry for your loss. You are grieving and still processing what happened.  Hang in there
All the hugs. Nothing I can say will help but know you do not grieve alone.
You are welcome. That was powerfully written. I will genuinely think of you.
I'm so sorry about your loss. Just know you're not alone, all the hugs and best wishes to you and your family
I understand grief like this. I just experienced a great loss a few months ago. My mom. We didn’t know that she was sick. At least not as sick as she was. We thought that she was having worsening anxiety. Turns out it was leukemia. A very aggressive kind of leukemia that popped up out of nowhere. She was admitted to the hospital a week before she died. I had been with her the day that she left this world. I’d had to leave when visiting hours were over. I got the call as I was getting ready to go to sleep. My world shattered. I broke down. My cousin drove me to say goodbye that night. The whole next week was absolute misery. I had panic attacks. Extreme guilt. I hoped that this was a nightmare and that I was going to wake up any minute. I didn’t wake up. It wasn’t a nightmare. My cousin, aunt and uncle made sure that I ate. That I drank enough fluids. That I took my psych meds. It hurt so bad. It still hurts. I’m crying right now.
I’m sorry OP. The pain of losing someone you love never truly goes away. But becomes tempered over time. Take care of yourself.
L.
My step mom died less than a week ago and I know exactly what you mean. After she died I didn’t shave my legs for like 2 weeks because it just felt so unimportant. I was wearing my sweatpants and sweatshirt all the time, never put on makeup and barely went outside just from the pure confusion. I wasn’t sad I was confused. The stages of grief don’t go in a specific order and I happen to be stuck on disbelief since it happened. I just don’t get that she’s not here anymore.

I also hate the shitty half assed encouragement. In reality, it could take a year for me to get past disbelief, who really knows? It’s different for everyone. And one of the first people I talked to about this told me “It doesn’t get better in the sense that their loss is no longer sad, it gets better in the sense that you see their loss in different ways as time goes on. And, it could take years for your view on it to change.”.
I am so sorry for your loss. I am there for you if you need someone. Write me a DM and maybe we could connect via other means. 
Just know I am there
My condolences
ey, im kinda in a bad mood rn, but for a much lesser reason. you wanna be sad together? sometimes people just need someone to be sad with, i understand.
[deleted]
Thank you.
Thank you.  This isn't my first major loss, but the last one took ten years to come out the other side of, feeling like this every day.  It's hard to be here, only a single day out, and not feel like it's the start of another ten-year grieving period.
Losing a parent is a special kind of agony.  I lost my dad suddenly almost eleven years ago now, and though the immediate pain has dulled over time, every milestone, every victory he misses, breaks my heart anew.  I'm glad your family is supporting you through your grief.  You be sure to take care as well.
Thank you for sharing.  I think I was still in a bit of shock when I posted this earlier.  I'm connecting with myself a little better now and time is speeding up a bit.  This isn't my first major loss, but this is the first one I've had during a period of emotional growth, and it startled me just how fragile this new version of myself was after such surprising shows of strength and resilience over the past week.  Unlike my last loss, I am in a good place emotionally and I have the tools to make it through, and knowing that I won't have another decade-long grieving cycle is already helping me keep some hope.  I'm gonna add this to my post as an edit now.
Thank you so much, it means the world to me.
Thank you.
Yeah, I get that.  As much as I don't want anybody to be sad, it's nice not to be alone in it.
I can only hope she would be.  I never got to tell her about me being trans.  By the time I knew, she was already too far gone, mentally, to understand.  I never heard her say anything nasty about the LGBTQIA community, but she was also never confronted with it in front of me, so it just never came up.  I know she loved me deeply, but some part of me can't help but wonder.
I understand where you are coming from. Sometimes the best we can do is 1 step at a time, and 1 day at a time. Hopefully this one won’t last 10 years as you had some experience now but it doesn’t make it any better. So hang in there
Losing a parent suddenly is a special kind of hell. And I’ve gone through it twice now. I hope that you are going to be okay.
Yeah they’re helping me, they just don’t know about the me that is to be. They don’t know that I am trans, yet.
Of course, happy to share if it’s able to bring any good to the table. I’m glad you’re in a good spot emotionally, I think of it as “well a shitty thing happened, as they do, but at least I know I’ll be okay in the end”, because if you just think the world has ended forever, you’re not going to get anywhere. I dunno maybe I’m looking at this logically but what I’m trying to say is take care of yourself. I think it goes without saying mental health is important when you lose someone.

Also thank you for sharing your experience, really appreciate actually seeing how I’m not alone.
Good luck on your journey, I hope they stag as supportive as they seem to be once they know.
I’m hoping that they’ll accept me for me."	vddv1h	trans	205	1.0	2022-06-16 04:49:49
Is it normal to be sad about this I’m a trans girl?	There was this hot cute blonde guy and he seemed into me before he knew I was a trans girl and he said he couldn’t fwm in a sexual manner and it kinda hurt on the inside how he thought I was pretty until he realized I’m not a cis girl I’m a trans girl. It made me feel dyphoria tbh	"I was trying to meet a guy who thought I looked cute too, suddenly he told me he only liked me  ecause I'm trans, that felt really shitty.

Its difficult, but keep in there, do t let peoples ignorance stop you from being g yourself. Hugs and love
It may boil down to simple genital preference, but i dont know the whole story so idk. Regardless im sure you look fantastic at all times
I've been sorta in love with my friend for awhile. We have gone on trips and click so well. I tried flirting with him and he told me he cant because hes not gay. :/ shit sucks it's ok to feel bad about it girl. Sending digital love ur way <3
Before I met my bf, I would get a lot of matches on dating apps who would immediately unmatch me after a few min. I realized they didn't read my profile (which said I'm trans), and when they did they would unmatch me. It was definitely a shitty feeling.

I'm with my current bf for almost 3 years now, and it's been amazing! I know it's tough out there, but hang in there because you can find someone who loves you and respects you for who you are
That's definitely normal to feel like that. But just know the reason he says he doesn't find you attractive is because of his insecurity with his sexuality and is trans/homophobic
Yeah... It hurts a lot... Someone called me ""not a real woman"" multiple times and yet tried to fetishize me sexually... I blocked him and it took some time to recover. I thought that no one would ever love me as who I am. I decided to be a single for life. But my current boyfriend (long distance) is like ""I don't care what your body is, I love you. I'll adapt myself according to your body"".
That really sucks. But to take the silver lining, you’re pretty! For some people that’s gonna be a barrier for others it’s not, if this hot cute guy found you pretty there’ll be others who don’t have this hang up who do too. If someone who has that hangup about trans girls was still attracted to you before he found out that shows that you pass hella well and look damn good doing it. Go get ‘em girl!
It’s ok. Don’t waste your time on people jealous of you or hating you for own reasons. It isn’t your fault, girl.
Wanna be friends girly
It doesn’t make him gay your a girl
Is it transphobic/homophobic to have a genital preference? I don’t really get it, genuinely.
Don't be so quick to call transphobia. It isn't transphobic to have a genital preference. If he isn't attracted to male genitalia then they're just not sexually compatible. It happens.
Sure
ya and that makes me cry. I wish I was the girl he cant see in me but we cant force people to be into us. But I can share in our pain, scream at the unfairness of this world and work to be the person I want to be and one day find someone who loves me for the girl I am
No, it's not. Everyone has preferences.
It's not but this case doesn't sound like genital preference.
Its not transphobia or homophobic but some people perceive it that way when they don't get what they want.

People have preferences and that's just how it is. I even knew a guy who had a preference for his girlfriend to be an alcoholic. I don't think that is a very good preference but supposedly if his girlfriend didn't drink as much as he did then it would be a deal breaker for him.

Some people just get turned off at the sight of a dick. Some people might even just get turned off at the site of a dick on a girl but like it on a man. Its actually scary how many people go through the situation of being trans but are willing to throw shade at people for having a preference. 

HOWEVER of course this does not excuse the person in the OPs post. There are bad people out there in all communities and clearly the one in the OPs post is one of them.
It kinda depends? Like, having a genital preference and not wanting to have sex with people who don’t have those genitals isn’t either of those things. I don’t think that really makes someone not able to be attracted to you unless there’s also something else going on. Like, having someone we’re attracted that for whatever reason we wouldn’t want/be comfortable having sex with is totally normal and I think for most of us it wouldn’t just make us not attracted to them. 

Obviously “transphobic” and “homophobic” are pretty negatively loaded terms but I don’t think it makes someone a bad person or anything to have some internalized discomfort that makes someone uncomfortable even thinking about being attracted to someone with the same genitals. Not saying that happened in this case, necessarily, but I think that’s a real thing that’s socialized in people by our cisnormative homophobic culture (again, I wouldn’t call the guy a homophobe for that, I generally wouldn’t do that for anything that’s not malicious, just saying there could be an element related to that).
No, it's not. This comes up a lot. People want certain things in the bedroom and genitalia can be a part of it for many.

It's super unfortunate if someone thinks you're hot then learns you aren't compatible, but what can you do? And if the fact that someone has a penis or vagina is dysphoric for them, that's just a reminder. As long as the person is respectful, it isn't their bad. It's just how their sexuality works.

This affects trans people a lot in a negative way, but it's not necessarily anyone being transphobic. It's just another hurdle. And you'll see on dating apps many trans people make it clear in their profile, because who wants to connect then figure out they're either transphobic, or not okay with your genitals?

Personally I think dating apps should ask genitalia and people have the option to hide people with certain genitalia, but I haven't seen that. It'd avoid a lot of issues.

I don't have a genital preference, but if people do, whatever. That's just what they want in a sexual relationship."	sw3k2e	trans	197	0.97	2022-02-19 06:36:48
Sorry but every trans fem needs a trans masc friend to tell her how pretty she is whenever she’s sad		"Or just a friend, any gender, cis or not
I'm ftm and I'm here to tell you that you're all brave, strong and pretty ladies 😘
It's always been the opposite for me - I (the transfem) comforting the transmascs 😭😭 although even before I came out as transfem I was the therapist 😭
That seems not two sided at all, also you shouldn’t have a friend to just compliment you, that’s not a real friend
Why does the friend have to be masculine?
I'm trying my best but I have only so many hours in the day and one of the side effects of T already takes up a chunk of those hours 😅😅😅
Repay them by calling them handsome! (Or however they like to be complimented)
WHERE IS HE
It's not the job of transmascs specifically to ""cheer up"" their transfem friends. If you're referring to an actual dynamic that you and your transmasc friend is happy w, that's fine of course.
I just wish I had any friends. I only have a handful. : (
Omg please and thank you!
I have a trans masc coworker does he count? I only get to see him like once a month 🥲

Edit: spelling
I do have a trans man friend... Oh no wait, he's in Spain now :( nevermind
I just have a (probably biased because she's also my girlfriend) trans fem complimenting me constantly
I am transfem. I am married to the love of my life, cis female. She tells me I'm pretty and shows me I am attractive all that time. It definitely helps me.
And I will tell him he’s handsome whenever he’s sad
I used to have one. We grew distant ages ago. I miss him...
Whens my turn
I do miss being called pretty. Maybe one of these days I'll feel like it again.
I don't think we should use our friends to get compliments or to feel better about our appearance. If they legitimately want to compliment someone, that's fine! But having friends just to compliment you, specifically ones that are trans masc because you're trans femme and for some reason that makes their compliments more valid? That's not okay to me.

I don't want to be complimented, I hate it. I compliment my friends when it's clear they're trying something new or they are specifically shy about something and they need that extra comfort. But I mainly compliment their personality, their goals and things they've done, what is new and good in their lives. I don't get these things back, but I don't care, I don't do it to feel better or to make them feel better. I do it because I want them to know I legitimately think those things about them. Friends don't need to give compliments, they just need to be there for someone to the best of their capabilities without crossing the boundaries of becoming a therapist for their friends.
What if I don't want attention from men?
I think this is pretty true
I tried but for some reason I’m my rural area trans men are allowed but trans women aren’t, the three trans men I’ve met were very fucking toxic and treated me like garbage 

I thought I’d found my ppl but nope 

I really want that though, I’m lesbian but having a guy tell me I’m pretty is the best 🥺
Truth
We shouldn't encourage having token friends. Find real friends who will treat you well, regardless if their identity.
I wish I was capable of having friends. It would be nice to have a consistent connection with someone and hype each other up and have fun with. Maybe in the next life :)
Only way IC managed close to this is posting on reddit
Legit kinda have this, it’s just more of an coincidence tho lol
I’d take any friend to be honest, it’s rather pathetic. Not gonna lie, another trans friend would be pretty nice, but I’m not quite human enough for friends. Sub humans don't get human friends.
And that's what my sister is for she almost always notices when I'm down and makes me feels better though having a trans masc friend would be cool
Ugh, yeah I could use a friend like that. :(
Yes please!!!!
Not everyone can be pretty - it's a fact of life. Some people are just ugly, like me. We just have to accept the fact and understand there is more to being human than being pretty. 

And think about it, if us uggers didn't exist, there would be no beautiful people because beauty is kinda relative. Let's just be happy that some people get to feel pretty - better that than no one.
Truly, just general gender affirmations from people who give a shit makes all the difference in the world.
🥰Ty, and you’re a handsome, amazing, hunk of a man, sir!
Hey there. Can I get one of those compliments?
well if u need a transmasc to tell u today, ur lovely and I hope u have a great day
💀💀💀

I miss my transmasc friends from highschool. We all didn't know we were trans yet but there was some magnetic pull towards one another. I keep up with one guy still and I wish I saw him more. Theres something about equal yet opposing experiences that I just find really comforting. Being able to get a whole other perspective on the trans experience and all.
But correct, you are very pretty.
What if the transfem told her transmasc friend how handsome they looked to cheer them up too?
duhdoy, it's really obvious she didn't write that because she thinks it's the job of transmascs to do that
Why do you feel the need to choose to interpret that in the most bad faith way possible? 

Plus she never said anything about it being a job or requirement of transmascs to do anything. Those are your words you put in their mouth.
I could not imagine a more annoying and useless self victimising response to this post than yours. Good job.
I find it really weird how people are trying to dunk on you so hard for this. You're right, and this is kind of a weird post in general. Like, if it's a dynamic that OP has with someone, that's cool. But we already have such a problem with transmasc people in this subreddit being talked over. I'm sure this is just a shit post, but do we really need to shit on transmasc people when they express discomfort with certain posts?
Hey you’re really pretty even though you don’t hear it irl it doesn’t change the fact you are pretty
along that line: what if i dont have low self confidence and am just blessed with chronic major depression?
Why does the gender of your friend matter, it’s ok to not want to be around people because of their identity?
this is most saddening and insightful
Always give a shit about everyone!!! You're valid
Thank you so much❤ have an amazing day :)
I love how apparently no one can tell where the line between using a friend as a therapist and having a friend is
If she likes. I think it's important that she's not ""expected to"" since a lot of us fall into this trap of needing validation for every little thing. Personally I'm averse to both giving and receiving compliments (hence my admittedly knee-jerk reaction).
Well, *she* probably didn’t mean it that way, but there is transphobia and erasure (especially nonbinary/non-gender-specific and sometimes transmasc erasure) within the trans community itself. This subreddit mostly consists of transfems, which is fine, but it can lead to this kind of erasure, and sometimes even transphobia within itself. So again, while OP probably didn’t mean it, the possibility is always there. What she described kind of sounds like a one-sided exchange, and while in this case it was probably just a poorly thought out shitpost, some people may actually think that way. I’m not saying you’re wrong, but you didn’t have to be ao rude about it.
Well clearly I acknowledged that possibility. At the same time I wanted to point that out bc from experience being used as a crutch is a pain in the ass lmao. Don't be dense.
The original post reaks of ""token friend"" energy and this person called it out as such, and you're trying to tell someone who is the target of this tokenization that they are ""self-victimizing""? You missed the point and come off as an ass, good job.
Your very sweet, and pretty too! I appreciate you for telling me, it's been awhile tbh
I'm being ""rude"" because I know how much it can sting when your intentions are good and you get told off. If you're a caring person and that happens a few times to you, you'll be walking on so many eggshells that you're afraid to say anything because you're scared you're going to get scolded again.

It took me a long time to get over that and it's still difficult for me.

And I don't get what's so damaging about a transfem appreciating her transmasc friend calling her pretty.
You're the dense person here. Saying things like they when someone obviously doesn't have the intense just makes people feels like they have to walk on eggshells because everything innocent and positive we say will be taken with offense. We don't need that from our own community.
ofc ty
I get that feeling too, but it’s still important to recognize as many perspectives as possible. I know you don’t mean to be rude, it’s just important to be mindful is all.

The letter my parents won't ever read	"Dad, thank you so much for aways supporting me, you make me cry everytime you ask me for explaining better how I feel and all, I don't have the confidence to explain every single thing to you, but I really appreciate for aways being on my side, being so supportive about everything, and accepting in the way I am, I love you, so much, even tho I don't really tell you that...

Mom, I hope you change, your transphobia really makes me sad."	"Plain and simple. Thanks for sharing
Send it anyway.
it's always better to tell the truth. atleast send your dad the parts about him. i'm sure he will appreciate it very much.
you should send it!
I wrote a very similar letter a couple months ago, and sent it. I’m honestly shocked at how much my parents turned around after that. 

My letter was much longer, and talked about a lot of other personal issues, but I feel like the brutal honesty really changed something. I now have two supportive parents, which was totally worth it.
I hope some day I have the courage to do the same...
Yeah it was definitely a terrifying moment, pressing send. One thing that really helped me was writing in to not respond to it for 48 hours. This helped buffer things. (And I had my partner read it first to sanity check.)

I experienced something horrible getting a blood test today	"I got a blood test today. Im 4 months hrt, im in cis levels (mtf 26) on my blood test papers i had to give the ppl, it said F (my gender) on the blood test papers because of my gender affirming doctor, I was fully presenting fem, like when i was fully presenting fem, like i had a mask on and ive been having lazer on my face for like 8 sessions or whatever. basically she said because of the papers shes like ur not a woman this (she pointed at the gender and)  is wrong (she pointed at the F in the gender section)   


  
like all i said after that was im sorry, im so sorry i was born in the wrong body im sorry, im trying my best and ill admit i cried alittle after that. like eventually she put unknown on my gender but like i dont know. im sad, im alittle angry and like there are parts of me that dont wanna be here and just wanna visit the void. like i just wanna be left alone and blend in.   


i hate going to get blood tests and im sorry for existing,  i hate my downstairs as much as u do  


im sorry, ill try to be better"	"Don't beat yourself up. The person who did that was way out of line. 

I'm sorry you experienced that.

\*Hug\*
You should talk to that person's supervisor and customer relations if they're corporate.  Shit like that is inexcusable from healthcare providers.
A healthcare provider who you trusted hurt you because of her own ideological reasons based on an immutable fact about you. Don't make excuses for her shitty behavior. She had no reason to act like that. I'd come for her job and make as much noise as possible. You're not going to be the only person that she treats like that. Don't shut up.

She sounds like such a Karen that sought out some phlebotomy courses because she thought it would make her look like a good person while being rotten inside.
Don't know where you live but most western countries have some anti-discrimination laws, and this might well break one of them.
I’m sorry you had to go through with that🥺 *hugs*
Sorry you have to go through this. I a straight make 68 years on and believe that gender is between the ears and not the legs. Please be patient and things will improve for you.
I just want to tell you that you are valid and it’s the lab tech who was way out of line. You don’t need to be sorry and you don’t need to apologize. Not to us and definitely not to that lab tech. You’re the one who decides your gender, not a piece of paper with some numbers on it. 

I’m so sorry that you had that experience. But I know we all see you and support you.
Please complain to your doctor and the lab. This is entirely not OK. This behavior is grounds for medical malpractice. 

Im so sorry for your experience today. You deserve to be treated with respect. You are valid as you are.
It’s not your fault that some people choose to be ignorant, insensitive and cruel people, you’re simply being the person you feel you are inside and there’s nothing wrong with that, keep being yourself and don’t stop for anyone
Do you want a hug?
Fuck, I'm so sorry that your doctor has treated you like this. This is absolutlely wrong. Your gender has NOTHING to do with your body, ie, no matter HOW your body is, your gender is valid. I'm sorry that anyone has made you feel otherwise, especially a doctor - someone we are expected to trust. This is wrong, and there is nothing wrong about your body being however it is.
Um make sure to lodge a complaint against her.
fuck im so sorry! as a phlebotomist, she should have received disciplinary action for that level of disrespect. phlebs aren’t doctors, we took a 2-4 week class on drawing blood, so she said that with absolutely zero medical authority. it’s never your responsibility to stop a care provider from disrespecting you but in the future you can 100% ask to speak to her supervisor, never worry about being a “bad” patient because you employ these people. if you have the energy now and you want to, you can also file a civil rights complaint against the hospital or clinic where it happened (which is a major pain in the ass but the payout is pretty fuckin awesome and since it would be such a pile of paperwork for the hospital it’s a good bet they’d shape up how they treat their trans patients)
I'm so sorry that happend to you and I really hope that something like this never repeats!! 
That was extremely unprofessional and 100% her fault - you should definitely make a complaint.
Please don't feel guilty, you did nothing wrong. ❣️
You did not do anything wrong. There is nothing wrong with you. You are a woman. That nurse was out of line. I don't know if it's possible for you but I would change doctors and let your current Dr know why
So it could also be an issue with the forms themselves. I'm in the medical field and our paperwork says gender while our actual system is sex. Both of which are different things. That being said, it's important from a medical standpoint to know what sex someone is born as more so than the gender that someone identifies as since someone birth sex can have influence over how medications might affect them or what certain symptoms might mean.
Sis, you do not need to try to be better. you do not need to be better. You got through an experience with an invalidating person who was being bigoted, got the blood test you needed to get, got out of the building, and came and shared with your trans siblings who love you.
Literally nothing to apologize for. You got this.
I will give you all the hugs if you need it. You do not deserve this at all!
I’m sorry this happened to you. You don’t deserve to feel this way.
THATS IT. I, 5,5 FTM AND 16 - NOT AT ALL TRANSITIONING, WILL GO TO WAR FOR YOU!!!! HOW DARE THIS PERSON MAKE YOU FEEL TERRIBLE FOR BEING TRANS 

*hug*
Now you go dress as femme as you want and make yourself feel like the true woman you are whilst I make that doctor a ""were/was""
My GP was freaking out about my kidney function, but realized that it had been reported against F standards. By M standards, I am in great shape. Never thought I would want to have an M on my paperwork. My official sex is F. I went in for blood tests and asked the lab tech to change my marker(F) on the paperwork to M because for some tests, there are different standards for M/F. The lab tech said that she couldn't change it because my government ID had F and that was what they had to use.  GP and I have agreed we will just have to remember to look up the correct standards when viewing my results. If only I could yeet that damned Y chromosome and graft in another X.

It sounds like the lab tech may have been trying to do the right thing (reporting results against M standards) but very poorly executed. Intervention needed.
I hope you are able to file a complaint. She is obviously not competent. You weren't asking for anything special, do not feel bad. She messed up the most basic thing you can do for a trans patient. What an idiot.
Don't worry about it, every body is different and absorbs the hormones differently. Talk with your doctor they can make the correct adjustments to your medication to get you to the correct levels or correct whether the pill or shot maybe the best fit for you. If you just started you could be on a low dose just to see how your body responds.  The bottom line is if your a woman then your a woman  tell her you have thyroid issues and its non of her business...
I don't know how many people see it the same way I do or not but for me I was born a guy but want to be a woman since I feel more authentic that way. If someone looks at my blood results and says your a guy because of your blood. So what my blood resembles a guy's. It's not like everyone will see that my blood is abnormal. Also I'd probably wip out my driver's license and show them my legal gender, female, and be like, I don't know what else to tell you. In the way of passing. I know it feels horrible to not pass when your trying. I don't pass well because of my voice but I love it and it is part of my personality please don't beat yourself up over it. I try to tell myself every time I'm in a anxiety inducing situation that the person is just here to take my blood and they don't probably will not remember me, or I'm in a store buying something and all the store wants is money so they shouldn't turn away a friendly customer who intends to pay.
im sorry, and thank you
Can we get a group hug?
I’m actually not super educated on this topic so if I’m wrong please correct me, but don’t they need AGAB for medical reasons? Like certain things have different effects for AFAB/AMAB right?
maybe ill put in a complaint over the phone, i will admit i am scared irl of going there  like even tho i know nothing physical would ever happen.  


if nothing happens ill put in another complaint irl like i dont wanna speak to her ever again rn
Anti-discrimination laws generally apply more to businesses refusing service to a protected class, they don’t prevent people from saying things that make us upset.

To be clear, I still think the person was being an ass.  They just didn’t do anything that would give OP grounds for legal action.
Still not an excuse to be an ass
May I help you plot the revenge?
As someone who apologizes too much, You literally have no reason to be sorry. The only person causing problems here is this bigoted doctor

For blood tests, it is better to go with hormonal sex. If I'm listed as male, it'll flag my cis female hormone range as irregular, for example.

For many things, actually, AGAB matters less than hormonal composition.
I just had a similar run in with a Lyft driver.  I went straight for the throat.  He doesn't work for Lyft or Uber anymore.  Federal law enforcement, state law enforcement and local law enforcement all did investigations.  Lyft almost lost a federal contract over it.

I *will not* deal with shit like that from anyone.  I'm a veteran and I volunteer with NGOs and local nonprofits.  I don't deserve to be treated like that. 

Neither do you.  Stand up for yourself, gorge.
Seriously, it’s out of line and considered discrimination in some countries. They’re imposing their own bigotry on their clients/patients. Sex is included in your records so your gender should be F on your blood test.
I used to dread going to the pharmacy because of a tech there. Finally I called crying and talked to the pharmacist in charge and they filed a complaint and confronted the tech. I changed pharmacies after that anyway, but maybe they won’t make the next person feel shitty for picking up life saving medication. 

If you call, I still think that’s very brave of you.
Well I'm not a lawyer honestly... and thinking twice, you might well be right.
Yes  you may
The funny thing is since I’m still listed as male in the system my tests are in always flag testosterone as too low and estrogen as too high.

Except that’s kind of the point of why I’m getting blood work.
Ah very interesting. So is there a certain point at which that changes? Like for example me not having touched HRT vs me a month on hrt
Exactly. Never. Take. Shit.   


It's okay to be scared. It's okay to want to run away. That said, we do NOT have to tolerate this sort of thing, and the faster people realize they cannot be shitheads without consequence, the better. Advocate for yourself because you cannot expect other people to do it for you. I got to war every time because I know along the line someone else has had to deal with stuff like this. Not on my damn watch.
In California and with the right DA and prosecutor, that is a hate crime, pure and simple. 

Even without, the company would have to deal with audits and investigations and no one in the company would be happy.
No worries, in general lawsuits are a long/expensive process and unless damages are significant or one is seeking some kind of landmark decision that would serve as future precedent, the juice usually isn’t worth the squeeze.
There's a certain point at which your hormonal levels get into cis range. For me, the first test I had that did that was around the 6 month mark
Was not necessarily thinking of suing that person, it's just that sometimes a simple mention of the existing law can lead some people to change their behaviour - even if for the wrong reasons.
So did you still have to put AGAB until then?
Yes.

My doctor had to put AGAB on my forms for insurance purposes. So anything from my doctor had an M on it until I got it legally changed. Since then, everything has been F. I know my AGAB is probably noted somewhere in my doctor's system, but I never see it now, not even in forms to take to labs or other doctors.

But, if the document already says the right gender, insurance isn't the issue."	107ba03	trans	190	0.97	2023-01-09 10:38:25
Parents said some stuff and now I feel awful	I (15 trans lesbian) went to therapy today but this time my parents came too, we discussed a number of things, but what my parents said made me feel really terrible. They still refuse to call me a girl, and don’t see me as one either, they keep saying that I will end up detransitioning and my mum gave a bullshit figure of 26% of trans people detransition (the real figure for my country is 0.47%) I have no idea what to say to this and I feel really frustrated and sad, the whole session went a hundred times worse than I thought and I feel like I’ve lost so much progress with my parents. Can any of you lovely people offer me any advice or kind words?	"Your current situation isn't the situation you're going to be in forever. You won't have to live under their roof forever. You won't have to spend your whole life listening to their bullshit. Unfortunately, some people are too stubborn to listen to others or learn new things. If they won't come around and respect you then they'll lose the opportunity to have a relationship with their daughter.

In the meantime you could try to link your parents actually credible sources about being trans or maybe link them the dysphoria bible? Idk your situation as well as you do so I wouldn't know what types of things would convince them to listen to you.

Best wishes, op. You're a strong girl, I know you'll accomplish your goals
Don't let them back in, if they don't want to support you don't give them the privilege of your company, or of your deep thoughts.
There was a Reddit talk that happened awhile back about those bullshit statistics and how it can be proven to be bullshit as well as other bullshit myths about trans people. I will try to find it for you. If you show it to them it may sway them. As well as give you ammunition in any debate with them. But I suggest you use this wisely and still kindly and patiently. Stuff like this is always a misunderstanding at the core and sometimes parents will look at any slight or impatience or lack of argument in the moment as ammunition to confirm their prejudice. If you want a good relationship with your parents you can’t forget to be careful and steadfast. You’re leading a horse to water, you can’t make it drink.
THIS.

Shitty behaviour has to have consequences, and people need to learn that.

Sad, true and funny tho		"So true. My bottom surgery can't come soon enough.
Oh no how am I going to go swimming?! I just now thought about this.
I didn’t even started my thr yet t-t
I think if you hurt your penis to the point of no return you can get bottom surgery, tho it depends on the country and how badly you hurt yourself. my plan is to take a zip tie and wrap it around it so it cuts off circulation and it kills it.
Oh, don't worry, but i believe you'll have to go swim with people you're comfortable with, and there's ways to hide the \~scrotum but i don't know how to say the word for that in english. I believe it's called tucking or something close to that...And that'll help you to be more comfortable in a swimming pool :3
You'll get there. A year of dysphoria to get approved for surgery after having already waited so long to get on hormones seemed like an eterity, but It'll have been a year for me in December. You'll get there one day.
NO NO NO, you can't! One trans did that in Brazil (where i live) and though she got lucky and her medics got there in time and got to make the surgery, that's absurdly dangerous and you might losing your chance FOREVER, DON'T. DO. THIS.

Also, this is incredibly irresponsible with your healthy >:(
Yeah I might even just wear a swim shirt and shorts.

Coming out to yourself	"It's a truth you can't look at directly or you'll panic. You don't know what will happen if you face it, you just know that when you do, the consequences will be terrible.

For years, maybe decades, you hadn't even realised it was there with you, a creature that you were so accustomed to ignoring that you just assumed it to be a normal part of life. Nobody else acknowledges this thing, but it's there for them too... surely.

And then one day you realise, the creature is yours. It only knows you and you're the only person capable of knowing it's there.

How could you have not realised before? A Thing the size of an elephant, hanging out with you every day and for so long you had hardly noticed.

Now you know it's there.

Now you're terrified.

You take time, trying to address the threat out of the corner of your eye. You must. Not. Look at it. If you look at it, you'll die.

But the anxiety and the fear is all consuming. And the curiosity.

What is this Thing that nobody else seems to know is there. What does it want?

And one day it's too much.

You can't go on like this.

If you don't face this Thing you'll wither away and die anyway.

Doomed if you do, doomed if you don't.

So you turn, eyes closed, take a breath and open them.

And it's not what you thought.

The kindness, and the sadness, of the eyes that look back at you strike you in the heart. They flow into a void you didn't know was there and the creature smiles, and starts to cry.

And you cry too.

It wasn't a thing of anguish and pain, or some terrible threatening monster. The creature is pure life, and peace, and colour, and joy, and it's been so, so lonely without you.

Nobody could see it but you, and you pretended you couldn't.

You feel so much regret, but it forgives you, and embraces you, and for the first time in your life the weight is lifted.

You feel whole.

Reunited."	"I had tears reading this, thanks for putting words to some of my most difficult emotions!

By the time I finished reading this I had so many tears in my eyes the words were blurry and I could barely see. This described my experience to the T. Thank you.
Thank you for this. I'm balancing on the edge between who I have been and who I think I'm meant to be. I'm not there just yet but I'm certain there is happiness waiting for me.
My emotions are a mystery to me but this definitely hit something. Thanks I loved it.

Okay, being tall sucks. I bought this dress, it fits perfectly, its gorgeous, but its too short. Im so sad :( Also this is my first pic with my face on it ><		"1. Tall women are powerful, but yes that's true when it comes to wardrobe.
2. Yes is does!
3. It really is!
4. Too short for who? Looks fine!
5. I'm sorry... It can be a real struggle sometimes.
6. Welcome! You look amazing.
I think it looks super cute! especially with the knee socks!
tall girls are pretty
You could also wear black leggings with it, either long or cropped.  The dress looks great on you!
Tall girls are the shit! You look so lovely but yeah maybe a bit short if your ass is popping out lol. Otherwise your face is so pretty. And it hurts that you’re sad. I’m so sorry. I hope things are looking up soon. Btw all your other pics are amazing, you have so many great dresses, I’m so jealous!
Your height is actually beautiful
Maybe you could add an extra skirt under it, so it has 2 skirts? Could be cute
You look amazing! The dress suits you great and I don't think it is to short.
Look at it this way: you would make a great Miss Sara Bellum for a costume/cosplay idea.
Firstly you're beautiful! Tall girls rock! And secondly maybe try leggings/tights and some knee-high boots? 😉
Too bad, it looked so good on you :(

If you still wanna keep it, you could wear a long skirt underneath maybe? :/
I really like the fit! But I know the struggle. I'm short but broad so a lot of things look funny me. 😭
For whatever it is worth, there are plenty of tall guys like me in the world who do nothing but dream of the day they meet a beautiful, tall woman like you.
I think you look beautiful in it. I want to take you on a stroll through the park while you wear it.
My flat ass almost peeks out from this :(
Thanx!
Thank you :\*
Its kinda impossible to get any good shoes/boots with my feet size :(
Club dress (if that's your thing) or wear with some kind of leggings or fancy jeans even 😉
My trick with that is to wear black shorts with it. Works every time
I hadn't thought of that, I'm actually having the same problem finding men's shoes to fit me. It really sucks sometimes, but hey you still look amazing! ❤️
Hey girlie, I was thinking about your plight felt bad and wanted to maybe help so I did some quick googling and found some places that might work? Sorry if it doesn't though.

I really really need help.	"In the car coming home from school my asked how my day was and I said good. That was a lie so I texted her about how how it’s was because of dysphoria, depression, anxiety, and self hate and she came and talked to me and hugged me and talked about how she was sad she couldn’t help me. In response I texted her about how she could actually help by helping me to start HRT or at bare minimum start puberty blockers to give me more time and yadsa yadda. She then decides to come in and tell me that the science behind it is experimental and to stop researching it and that I’m likely to de transition and that this is sudden( I came out 3 months ago and have known for 3 years) and that my brain isn’t developed enough to make that desicion at 14 and that she can’t allow me to not have kids since it’d make me infertile despite the fact I don’t want kids and if I did I’d adopt, and how she thinks I don’t know what I’m feeling and calling me invalid and shit and now I’m a crying ball of self hate and shame because my mom is an anti vaccine Karen that believes in essential oils and shit.
What am I supposed to do."	"It doesn't sound like she's the type to be influenced by evidence, but you could at least try sending her some info/studies about puberty blockers? Beyond that I'm not sure what there really is to do, because someone who refuses to change their mind isn't going to.

I wish I had some magic way to help everyone in your situation... all I can offer is a virtual hug
A karens mind cant be changed,  they are like q qanon nuts, im so sad for you , but unless you plan to leave your parents and tell your parents about a new adress ,you need really close friends, nothing will change
Hi OP. I feel for you deeply. Coming from a narcissistic parented background, I see a lot of things in your post that flags me - the transphobia, denial of evidence as long as it suits her, the invalidation, etc etc etc.   


You're not an extension of her; you're your own human. You aren't questioning, you know who you are. I've learned this the long and very hard, painful way, but when a person loves you, they are capable of accepting truths that are hard for them to swallow.   


That being said, I will agree with only one point your mother made: you are young, and things that will impact your life permanently should be taken with great care. It's true that some people do regret not having children after being sterilized.   


Here's a solution I can offer you. I'm not sure what sex your body is, but you can freeze eggs and sperm, on the off chance in the future you change your mind about kids. HRT is good to start perhaps at the age of 17 or 18, because you're still young enough to make transition, but old enough to really have your priorities straight. HRT requires a change in lifestyle, on a regular basis, that you absolutely must maintain, and that's difficult when you're very young.  


So, offer to freeze your DNA to your mother. If you're comfortable enough with her that you can research the science behind it all, offer to answer any questions she may have about it. (The science has been around for at least a couple decades and it is not at all experimental - it just differs from person to person for their particular needs.) I recommend checking out Stef Sanjati's channel on youtube if you're MtF, and Jammidodger if you're FtM. Both have detailed their experiences in detail. The medical transition is very safe if you're working with reputable doctors.   


Lastly - the invalidation is a big, big no no. You might feel very emotional because that's what teenagers of all types are; it's how they work, but you absolutely know your feelings more than anyone else, and you know yourself more than anyone else. This one was the big red flag for me, and I suggest that you be careful if you don't have a good relationship with your mother. I could go on about this, but I'll leave it at that for now. Please stay safe!
I would educate her on how harmless puberty blockers are. Even if you decided you werent trans, all you have to do is stop taking them and you go through puberty like you would have normally. It either helps your dysphoria, or nothing bad happens. 

Emphasize that they will allow you to have more time and grow before you decide (even if you're already very certain). It's a double win, you wont develop dysphoria inducing sex traits, and your mom wont worry that you're making an irreversible decision before you're ""old enough to decide""
Actually it wont make you infertile if it is Estorgen idk about testosterone. So here's what you can do:

1. Ask you mom or dad, whichever is more likely, if they will take you to see an endocrinologist (hormone doctor). If they say yes, go to the appointment, meet with the doctor, explain to them how you are feeling and then let your parents ask questions. If they allow you to go on hormones and/or blockers, good, immediately have them sign an authorization to continue that treatment with the doctor. IF YOU CAN, stay to talk with the endo in private and let them know whatever worries you have about your home life or question about anything.

If your mom/dad wont accept what they are saying and say you cannot go on hormones, this is where you make the decision between:
   
     a. Under US healthcare standards you are permitted to seek your own treatment IF it involves your mental care, substance abuse, or birth control. It is up to you to seek your care in this case and you may need to pay for your prescription. If you use your parents insurance they will find out. I assume the doc would not tell your parents but you must ask the doc this. Check with your school and see if they can help in any way. or...

2 Keep trying until you convince them or do it when you are 18.

Now as far as finding care goes, search google for transgender center/clinic/institute/organization of the state you live in until you find one that either has a list of trans health care providers or that you can call and ask for providers. If they make you feel uncomfortable in any way it is okay to try someone else. For example, where I live there is a ""transgender center for the rockies"" which has numerous resources for trans people. I just found a new doctor last month by chosing a woman from the list I though I'd like, then I called her care facility and made an appointment. You will have to answer a ton of questions though so be very patient.

All this information should be legally correct, but I highly suggest reading this to make sure I did not miss anything. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008301/
i hope that things will end up better for you
You're 14 and 3 months really isn't a long time for family to get used to it. Maybe they're scared. Mine were like this for three years when I came out at a young age. Overall depending on where you live you can't start E until you're 16/18 and i dunno your situation but you mightve started puberty now so its too late for blockers. Just ease off, let them come round.
Well, your mother is correct, your brain has not fully developed, you do not even have the right to give consent at 14 years of age. Your mother is just trying to help you here, I  have multiple friends that de-transitioned after puberty hit (I'm not saying that you will de transition but it is possible.)
I don’t have anywhere to go and I don’t have any friends
About getting health care myself, how do I do that, I don’t live near public transport, and can’t drive.
Blockers can be started at any point during puberty, not just before puberty
I started blockers at 11, and I’m starting testosterone exactly at my 15th birthday. It’s not impossible, but it is hard to get everyone on board
I'm not everything you need, but I can be friends :D
You will have to call somewhefe first. If you have any LGBT teachers or friends you shoild talk to them. Maybe someone elses parent will take you to your appointment. This is why you should talk to the school if you think they will be accepting. You MIGHT be able to ship your meds to your school after the initial appointment, but I am not sure if the school is not good with LGBT stuff.
Even still, if they have had changes they will not be reversed, and usually around this age you do have changes.
Many many countries don't let people do that, and like you said it is very hard to get people on board.
I know you can help but I have so many friends online but it doesn’t help, I need someone in real life.
Yeah but there's still a lot of changes that can be prevented, especially bone structure changes that happen slowly over the course of puberty
Trust meeee, I know. My best friend is just over a hundred miles away, and I haven't got many others. If you ever need a gal pal, I am... always willing

Dysphoria or Imposter Syndrome and the Big Sad	"I have no idea how to title this but its a big long rant about my mental state and gender identity.

My name is Morgan. I use she/they pronouns.

TLDR of it all for those that wont / dont want to read: For the last little while, probably since new years, Ive known I wasnt cis (amab) and im either nonbinary or a trans girl. Brain doesnt like this, and neither does my family.

Through constant interactions and being He/Him’d to death that was proof enough. The amount of people who’ve spread hate to me for just being me and calling me a guy still is really starting to  take a toll on my mental health. My parents are not supportive of anything LGBT and i have no clear support outside of a few friends, florida isnt exactly the greatest trans-friendly place in the world. 

My brain has started doubting that im even who i know i am, I cant look in the mirror or go 10 minutes without some kind of passing thought that im just doing it for attention and whatnot. Coupled with already being antisocial and I have been struggling pretty bad most days and Its so hard to continue. Gender identity is only the beginning of it and I wont go too far into the personal stuff. I just wanna curl up in a ball. 

Its bad enough dealing with the surrounding people who dont support my existence but when my own parents and even my own passive thoughts dont either, i dont know where else to go. Thank you for reading if you did make it this far. 

p.s. hugs are appreciated"	"I don’t know how I can help but big hugs to you my friend.
I struggle a lot with imposter syndrome as well so you have all of my understanding and support. 
One thing that helped me was doing a lot of research about my identity and reading things that felt affirming (like books and stuff, by trans/non binary authors) or listening to podcasts, educating myself about the concep of gender as a whole, so that I could clear my mind a little. 

Therapy is being very helpful as well, so if you have the chance to try it, I definitely recommend. It feels really comforting to be able to talk about your feelings openly without the fear of judgement. Make sure to find a gender therapist who knows what they’re doing ot at least a trans-friendly one tho.
I’m in the same boat, still thinking of being an imposter (even though I know I’m MTF) and a transition is nowhere in sight (due to my career and the fear of loosing my wife). I’m getting older (32 yo) and I don’t know what to do either. 

But I guess we have to take the time, listen to ourselves, and trusting the process of finding out what works best for us. We’ve been brainwashed by society to be one way and because we differ it takes time for us to figure out things. And seeing how long it takes me to figure it out myself, I start to letting go with others who I don’t expect to understand it if for me who is directly concerned it took a while…

Good luck Morgan! I’m sending you all the hugs possible, sister. We’ll go through it eventually 💪👩‍🦳
*hugs*
I’m sending you the biggest hug ever! Being unsupported is one thing, being mocked is another, and living in a giant transphobic cess pool of a state doesn’t help at all. 

1. Your feelings are valid and are subject to change as you dang well please..
2. Please don’t let the fact they hate themselves make you believe that their opinions are more valid than your own
3. You are loved. 
4. Still loved ❤️❤️❤️

Thanks for reaching out. You are much stronger than you know. Keep reaching out… we will hold you up if you feel like you can’t stand. This community is that freaking amazing !
I was born and raised in the Bible Belt. My family was disgusted with my transition as well and eventually they came around after a few years, but I never questioned that this is who I am. I recommend counseling or therapy to get your mind right. Much love ❤️
Hugs Morgan, hugs.  I know this so well.
Hugs from one Morgan to another ❤❤❤

Imposter syndrome is normal. So is dysphoria. Cis people don't have to question their gender identity and also don't regularly crave the opportunity to be seen as the opposite sex. And they definitely don't question it every 10 minutes lol. Feelings like yours are normal and don't make you any less valid as an individual.

Do make sure you stay safe, though. It sounds like you're in a less than good location to express yourself how you want. I would recommend trying to find some queer support groups or possibly looking into relocating. 

And don't forget that things will get better. As much of a cliche as it is, it's absolutely true. Stay strong sister ❤❤❤
I feel you. I'm having bad imposter syndrome tonight. I've been on E for 2 months, and know I'm on the right path. But I still feel like I'm a faker too. That I'm not actually committed to this, even though I don't see another way. I know for a fact that I won't make it much farther if I make myself live and age like a man (AMAB). I wish we didn't have to feel imposter syndrome. It freaking sucks.
I'll send hugs friend but I don't know what else to say I know how you feel somedays I begin to doubt my own transness and I don't even have friends for support. My mom only passively kind of supports me I know how you feel I'm sorry that you have to suffer like this my brain makes me feel like an impostor too.
Are we the only 2 non-cis Floridians?
Even 13 years into transition, I deal with this feeling. For me, I've found the biggest cause isn't a feeling of being an imposter but of being afraid of being accused of and attacked for being one. The ""not a real guy"" situation, of being viewed as something I'm not (a ""trap"") and being harmed. Knowing this has helped me a lot, because then I can direct my attention to working on social anxiety rather than trying to overcome a nonexistent sense of being fake (if I felt like I was faking being a man when I was a woman, I wouldn't have transitioned).

Hope this makes sense.
thankies 😔 it do be some hard times
girl power! all the good energy to you too, we’ll get thru this!!
i believe so

I'm Alice and I'm scared, sad and excited.	"The last few days have been very weird.. I've been dead inside for nearly 10 years with depression and anxiety. Today I broke down and I realised that I want to be a woman. I've just started looking at transtransitions and I have butterflies 🦋 in my stomach.

I'm scared that I won't be accepted, especially by my mother.

But anyway I just really want to say hello 👋 

Alice xx"	"You have to do what makes you happy and not worry about being accepted. I came out earlier this year and most people were fine with it but my mom is not, but I can’t let how she feels effect what I do and how I feel about myself. I’ve been much happier and less stressed out since coming out.

Good luck to you in your journey.
Hey we have the same name !
Hi Alice. I have news for you: you *are* a woman. I wish you the best as you begin to let other people know this too.
I have good news Alice, thanks to a certain children's book there are a million and one songs written about you and the majority of them can definitely have trans themes read into them.

""One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small.""

""The rabbit seems to call your name, you're late so it's time to move. Oh Alice you know it's your fate, tick tock no time to lose.""

""I still can hear all the shrinks who said some trauma was to blame. Light another cigarette. Breath in deep try to forget, that it's a photograph of Dyna and that Alice is my name.""

""As he sips my untouched drink, I say 'I can't be who I think.' He says 'You are, and you're not. And I am too.'""
alice is a swag name <3
My family (besides my brother) don't accept me and I choose not to care, I keep my head up high and say ""their opinion doesn't matter, it's my life not theirs and I can choose to do whatever I want to myself and be whoever I want to be"" and that's what has helped me through months of, my mum in particular just dropping transphobic comments all the time for no reason and trying to blame the internet for who I am. 
But anyways, my advice to you is to probably try and tell your family and other people around you if you know it's safe to, I didn't because it's not safe for me to come out in the current household I'm in and try and think about everything you can do to be happy because at the end of the day, if you want to do this and you know that that's what'll make you happy then do it and ignore other people's opinions. 
Thanks for reading - Evie (she/her)
Hello fellow Alice!😁👋 
(Ignore my user)
Hey Alice, I hope things get better for you girl. You deserve happiness.
Hi Alice! X
Alice, you are valid and you are loved 💜
Nice to meet you Alice.
You don’t want to be a woman, you ARE a woman and you always have been♥️ nice to meet you, Alice. beautiful name!
Hello Alice! I’m Sasha. Nice to meet you! Do what makes you happy. If transitioning is something that you need to do for you to be happy then do it. No matter what anyone says, who does or doesn’t accept you or what other people think, YOU are the one living YOUR life. Live it for you! Be happy! Be comfortable in your own skin! I came out last year after a lifetime of knowing and it’s amazing! It’s a terrifying thing to do, I won’t sugar coat it for you, but when you do it and start living as yourself it is the most freeing thing you will ever do. I wish you all the luck in the world on your journey! Much love! 🖤💜💚
Hey Alice! I hope you find comfort in your new feelings eventually, things will get better I promise you! It’s scary, exciting and weird all at once. But I promise as time goes on your path will get clearer. 

I don’t know if you like anime but I just finished Sword Art Online Alicization and it’s my favorite anime and my favorite arc, there’s a character named Alice and she’s one of the strongest characters and the arc is all about her! I suggest watching all of SAO as alicization is the last arc but if you’re into anime I bet it’s no problem. I literally just got done so when I see your name that’s who I think of and she’s one of my favorite characters!
hello, welcome to team trans
Hello Alice! I am so excited that you get to start this new journey! There’s a lot that will happen in your future, and I just want to wish you the best! Have a lovely day, girl!
Alice, First off, congratulations on finding yourself, 2nd, you're a woman, things get a lot better when you accept you already are, and last but not least, no need to rush it, I honestly thought my mom'd hate me too, things are a bit funky between us, but overall decent. Best of luck to you.
Hello! Welcome! I’m kinda new here too! I would suggest heading over to the r/MtF subreddit as well!
I can tell you this it's not going to be a easy journey I have I'm I've been on a transition  for 5 months now and I'm already seeing How difficult it's going to be. If you have no prior experience and live in a Single minded area its going to be really hard so I suggest   Finding people like friends and family who you can trust And let them help you
Just remember though, your safety is number one priority. Even if you have to hide and do things on the DL, if if you happen to have a sister they are an excellent source for ""requisitioning"" clothing items. Just hope I can help.

Finally felt not so dysphoric and took a picture of myself I feel happy with. Sad thing is, 2010 called and wants their style back. (3 months hrt)		"I like this pic, quite pretty. ❤️
You look so pretty! I'm honestly jealous, I wish I could pull that look off.
you look very kissable
You look fantastic! You really pull off the style! :D
That style is awesome. Don’t let anyone tell you different. You rock!

Found out my parents have supported me forever.	"After I came out the other night, it’s been a bit of a struggle. Parents have been trying to learn whatever they can and politely asked me not to take action until they learn a bit about what I’ve been going through, which I obliged because I respect them. 

Anywho…

My mom broke down tonight and said she was proud of me for coming out to them but that she was sad that I’ve been suffering in silence and afraid to tell them, and how they want to know these things if they happen in the future, so they can support me even more. 

I just didn’t know how to respond aside from crying 😂

Just knowing that I could have had their support years ago, makes me so happy"	"Yeah that’s how I felt after coming out to my mom. I wish I would have done that years ago!
I know that feel. When I came out to my mom her first words were ""I knew that!"" Honestly it made me feel so happy knowing she supported me... But also made me feel silly for how long I spent trying to figure it out for myself.
Congratulations! I hope all goes well.
I know that feel. When I came out to my mom her first words were ""I knew that!"" Honestly it made me feel so happy knowing she supported me... But also made me feel silly for how long I spent trying to figure it out for myself.
Hug your parents and show them that they raised a good human being. I'm happy for you!
“Asked me not to take action until they learn a bit about what I’ve been going through,” sounds like it could be used to try and delay your transition indefinitely.
Such a burden lifted off my shoulders. I agreed because of mutual respect to hold off on hrt for a bit while we talk just as a family. They’re not trying to persuade me, but they want to learn, but it’s just so relieving and comforting to realize my mom’s tears weren’t coming from saying I’m trans but from a place of being sad that they didn’t know what I’ve kept in the dark and suffered alone with.
It’s not. I had a really long talk with both of them. They had just asked if it was at all possible.
Sounds like smart parenting, not transphobia.

Remember that a child’s physical safety is a parents number 1 priority. Obviously once they research and find out that their fears aren’t connected with reality, then they ease off of protective mode and move to support mode.

Please try to have to have some level of understanding about modern parents’ perspective in the world today."	ss081y	trans	164	0.98	2022-02-14 03:06:06
Sadly relatable meme, made by me		"It took me a while to understand that blood =/= family
Ugh, OP, I am so sorry.  I can sadly understand *exactly* where you're coming from.  Your feelings are totally valid. You got this, though!
So very true of toxic people. We don't get to choose our parents but we do get to choose who we allow in our every day life.
Te quedó muy bueno el meme, tiene una verdad que provoca muchos problemas innecesarios qué en algunos casos provocan el suicidio, la familia uno no la elige pero hay que ser fuerte y superar los acontecimientos siendo de ayuda una comunidad de mucho apoyo como está, ojalá quien me lea tenga la fuerza de ser a si mismo libre.

“Rain” Trans Web Comic - Ending - My Personal Experience	"[Link](https://rain.thecomicseries.com/comics/first/) for those that haven’t read it, it’s really, really good and has been just finished after 11+ years.

So after seeing a post talk about “Rain” having finished, on another part of Reddit, I decided to have a look into it as i normally like to wait for stuff to be finished before reading them. (I hate when i like something then it just stops or is cancelled without a proper ending)

—————

So queue the last day and a half where i read all 1,400+ pages, i finally finished it at 1am last night (UK - GMT) and I couldn’t then get to sleep properly.

“Rain” hit me hard and i laid there having a Mental / Emotionally breakdown, i had a small cry. (I normally really struggle to cry, so this was rare for me).

The story is lovely and a beautiful and powerful journey, and it even has its happy ending.

—————

However i felt some of the most depressed i have felt in years, i just kept thinking about the pure awfulness of the world around us and how hard everyone makes it just for people to live as themselves.

But on-top of this i just felt sad how this story pretty much happens every day, but I’m here sat in a relatively comfy life and I’m genuinely jealous of these fictional characters.

I’ve just read how these people have there goals in life and went through hell to try to achieve them, but i’m here and I can’t even set a goal for today, let alone the next 1, 5 years.

—————

I don’t even really know where I’m going with this, I’m still laid in bed, slightly crying as i type all this.

Why did this effect me so much?

I just feel so worthless, i don’t know why I’m even here, I’m don’t do anything, I’m just an emotional burden on everyone around me, I’m emotionally selfish and it just hurts everyone else.

I jealous of some comic characters, i want that life, i want that passion, i want that drive, i just, i just.. I don’t even truly know.

—————

After a few minutes of calming down…

Sorry for all my rambling, i just needed to write this down, put down the emotions so to speak.

I think I’m going to go sombre for a bit, thanks for listening to my emotional ramblings.

—————

Edit: i’m fine btw, I’m not planning anything stupid, i just needed to get this out of my mind and need to think for awhile."	"I cried my heart out (and am on the verge just remembering it) with this comic.  I am in the midst of rereading it all and rating each one (I didn't want to stop the first time through).  This story was powerful.  I plan on saving up and buying the print versions.  

I too can't get it out of my head.  Don't forget one of the main underlying themes running through the entire series: Just be supportive, understanding isn't necessary. We all need help emotionally from time to time.  I find it very cathartic to just be an ear for someone in need.  I may not have the power or means to solve their issue, or even understand it completely, but it is significant to them.  Sometimes just being heard can be uplifting.

Anyway, I am glad others find Rain as moving as I did.
I was sad to see it ending just as we finally got a glimpse of who Rain was blossoming into. Her story didn't feel 'over,' despite the wrapping up of the story arcs, but just beginning.
I love the comic! It is fantastic work! I’m going to binge the entire thing
It was such a beautiful comic, the more I read the more drawn in I was and honestly it inspired me to use my gi bill of free education to go be a gender therapist so I can help all the kids and adults like me who didn't gave the source growing up! In sad it ended but im grateful it existed!
The ending hit a lot of us hard but I think its also something we needed
yeah i mean it was pretty good i just only read the first like 200 pages because i didn’t have the stomache for the trans girl dating the gay guy and also like all the slurs from rains brother and also if i remember correctly there was like that one dark haired girl who joins the group that i guess doesn’t really like being around men, and the author felt the need to add “and also looked uncomfortable around rain *for some reason*”
Really feel you there, wish I was able to work towards my goals like Rain, instead of mostly doing nothing because I am overwhelmed by my daily existence and future planning feels impossible when you feel like shit right now.
I read the first 150 or so pages over the last couple days, and agree with you about the goals thing. It’s inspired me to be much more active in trying to reach my end goals. It’s honestly hard to read at times because it’s so dense with things they’re very emotional and relatable, but it’s been so good.
i found out about rain about a week ago, and have spent the last week reading every single page since it started in 2011, i am exhausted but it was totally worth it, rain is amazing

Edit: ment 2010
I’ve been thinking on it, at it just was so real, i could see it all happening and it showed how much can actually happen in a short time, it felt like it showed so much, but actually so little.
It felt really weird as it was so long (1,400+ pages) but actually so short. (Only 10ish months in universe, excluding the last 2/3 chapters) i guess it was the going in depth with each day and it all built up into so much, but yet so little."	u695ye	trans	170	0.97	2022-04-18 09:37:46
Does anyone else just get waves of sadness/randomly cry? I'm not crying bc of anything specific, maybe it's HRT? Or depression?		"It’s HRT. It’ll go away over time. But you’re basically going through a second puberty, just a female one~
Let the tears out though, it helps. ^w^
Sadly it might just be due to the new Covid normal and political divisions and everything else that's wrong with the world.. 😔
I’m not on HRT and I get that often. Could be depression. I hope things level out for you. Looking fantastic though! 💜
For me in my depression and disphoria prior to finding my self I suppressed my emotions a lot like alot a lot. But when I started seeing my therapist and eventually started hrt my emotions started resurfacing and I stopped trying to suppress them. Think of it like going through a second puberty. I had to relearn how to manage my emotions again but by embracing them instead of suppressing them. Honestly it's so worth it amd I couldn't be happier. Turns out I'm a bit of a squish lol and I tear up at alot of things now but it's not a bad thing. I love cuddles and cry at sad moments in movies and TV shows even some commercials lol but I love being me. Squishyness and everything that goes with it
I started HRT quite recently, and it’s began happening to me as well, it may be a little silly at the things I’ve cried to, but I’m happy about it because it shows that the hormones are beginning to work :))
DEF HRT. I was sitting in my gfs car and i just started bawling
Could be both, honestly. I hear it's normal to experience this on hormones, especially if you have pre-existing depression. You'll get that urge to just cry randomly. See a doctor if it's bothering you or getting in the way of life, maybe see if you can get a therapist. Talking about it can help.
You look really nice btw op
I hear ya loud and clear. You’re totally not alone. I question myself everyday and sometimes my emotions just get the best of me. 
You’re valid, you’re beautiful, and you’re loved! Please try and hold onto that!❤️
For the first 2  years 9n HRT, I didn't need a reason to cry, I just cried all the time. 
Love and power to you, sis 💜
Yes I'm starting to realize that. I've been on HRT for a bit but just switched to injections and my body is feeling different and things are changing again.
Ugh I know 😖I've been spending so much time alone and it's lonely. And I'm in Texas and ppl don't take it seriously here
Thank you! 🖤🖤🖤 yes I think it's a bit of both
I’ve felt this way for a few months now and idk why
I feel more dysphoria now more than ever and it's weird bc I have been on HRT so I've seen changes so I'm more ""fem"" now but even more insecure. Thankfully reading allows me to escape! It frustrates me that I strive to be passable but I know that I shouldn't try I meet others beauty standards just for acceptance
hi, i’m a trans man. that is exactly how pms felt and whenever periods happened. i remember one time i just started crying because we were out of my favorite snack. it’s been interesting to experience how different both puberties are lol
Yeah! And when I think about it I really am not crying for any reason. Sure I can find reasons why I'm sad but it's not why I cried to begin with
Yes I think for many trans ppl we have pre existing depression or struggles so adding new hormones into the mix doesn't help it. My insurance kicks in Jan 1st so im going to find a therapist 🖤
I deadass listened to She’s Leaving Home by The Beatles and couldn’t stop sobbing from how beautiful of a song it is 😂 I wish you luck on your transition king 👑
Thank you for this! I don't have periods but I'm so hormonal! And I don't take my meds regularly just bc I forget some times so I doubt that's helping. Or I'll feel so depressed on day and just not do my injection. It's a catch 22
This is a big mood
Yep, gotta love being trans. I hope therapy goes well! It can quite literally be a life saver.

cis female here: having a period doesn't make you more or less of a woman	"Hi! I'm cis female, I joined this subreddit because I want to learn more about issues transgender people face as my brother is Trans and he hates talking about his feelings or issues. I want to make sure I'm not being unintentionally hurtful or anything. 

I saw a post asking if something was transphobic, and a lot of the responses made me feel so sad. So many woman here shared how they feel not being able to jave a period or become pregnant. Maybe this is stupid and irrelevant but you aren't alone in these feelings and they in no way make you any less of a woman. 

Since I started having periods at 11, I've been irregular to the point I only get it 2-4 times a year if that. And even then it'll only be for a day or even a couple hours. As a result, I can't have kids either. 

I was born a female, I identify as a female, and I also face these issues that so many females face. It's an honest struggle and it hurts so much seeing others look down woman with these issues. 

I'm not sure really what I was hoping to accomplish I just wanted to reassure those of you hurting that you are just as much a woman as me or anyone else who was born and/or identifies as a woman. Having a menstrual cycle and being able to have children don't change that. 🩷💕"	"Agree many women can't bear children.  It doesn't make them not women
You may not know what you were trying to accomplish but this post is probably going to be significant for at least one person
Some of us have periods.   Some of use don't feel dysphoria about ""wrong"" genitals. Some of us are sad we never bore children.
It was nice of you to share this
I have PCOS and endometriosis AND I DONT HAVE A PERIOD AT ALL, and I am still a woman. So are you!!!!!! And don’t let anyone try to take that away from you!
Speaking as a man who menstruates (a man-struator, if you will), having or not having a period doesn't make you more or less of any gender! Periods can be very dysphoric for trans men and some nonbinary people. They can also be very euphoric for trans women and some nonbinary people. Period products shouldn't be gendered and should be provided for free in all bathrooms.
Actually a lot of trans women do have periods, myself included. of course having them or not has nothing to do with your gender. There are lots of trans men who have periods and that doesnt make them any less manly
Thank you... I often find myself falling in this way of thinking despite being a trans woman myself, so thank you <3
It hurts so fucking bad to hear ""your so lucky you don't have periods"" by any of my cis female friends. I explain it every time and they understand mistake but how many times you heard this? I wish cis girls would understand how hurtful it is to hear things like that.
I'm glad I don't have to go through having a period tbh. They sound painful, I empathise with those that do - you're stronger people than I am!
That’s so sweet of you
Thank you for this <3<3
Very cool of you
Blessings and thank you for your compassion!
I’m a trans man and have been on various forms and doses of birth control on and off for almost 20 years because of my horrible period side effects. I went on Nexplanon back in 2015 and I was super worried about not having my period as a result of birth control. It just sounded like a really bad side effect to my uninformed brain. Like how am I supposed to believe I’m okay if this SUPER IMPORTANT bodily function is no longer functioning? Well. Turns out having your period is only super important if you’re trying to have a kid. If you’re not, you don’t need to have your period. So if anyone ever tries to revoke someone’s womanhood because “real women have periods” then they’re woefully uniformed about the reality of menstruating.
Jeez terfs are gonna hate this
Thankies
I don’t have periods but i still have the PMS like symptoms from HRT. Btw thanks for the support!!
""man-struator"" I am so upset I can't steal that bc it doesn't make sense in my language 😭
I'm sorry you struggle with thoughts like this! Remember many women struggle to feel like women due to infertility issues. You are not alone! You can check infertility subreddits to see how others cope or deal with these feelings too.
Came here to say this. It hurts, even if one is old enough that one would otherwise be post-menopausal.
I've always been told I'm lucky by siblings cousins and friends. Now I'm 26 and everyone is having/had kids and I've only been pregnant once but miscarried very early on.
How tf women do that kind of hurtful things to each other best thing about this is that I got ""menstrual like"" pains every month or so and I hate them but it's not period so I guess they think I'm lucky one
We were all young, I got my first period at 11 and didn't get my second for almost a year. Now that we're older they're concerned more then jealous. But some of my friends don't realize that no period affects infertility and they're just like ""omg lucky! I wish I didn't have a period!"" I don't really correct them because it's my business you know?
Believe me I can fully understand it, just wish more ppl would simply get it. I'm 24, sorry if my comment sounds angry it's very sad topic for me my gf also have problems and can potentially be infertile, I froze my sperm anyway but it was probably for nothing
You didn't sound angry or rude or anything, I just wanted to clarify that we were younger when my family made comments. All the best to you and your gf!"	zvw74z	trans	162	0.93	2022-12-26 20:34:58
When to come out to a guy you meet at a party?	Hi everybody!  I have a struggle.  i am a person who likes to go out and go to parties.  since I'm more and more comfortable in my skin and look more and more feminine, I get quite a bit of attention from guys.  they come to me to have a chat.  I'm open to that, because I like to talk.  also to improve my social skills.  if I really click with a boy, then it sometimes wants to get intimate and we start kissing. I often do this with mixed feelings.  because they don't know I'm transgender.  I don't think it's an option to tell it face to face.  I can't predict how they're going to react.  I don't want my evening to be ruined by that.  sometimes I exchange contact details with someone to talk online after the evening.  I'm pretty open about my transition online on tiktok so it's not hard for them to find out.  I would prefer to tell them myself, but I don't have enough time to do so. often they block me right away and that breaks my heart.  I am sad about it for days and that destroys me.  For example, this weekend I met a guy at a festival.  we had a great time together all evening.  When I got home I found out that he had blocked me.  I messaged him with another account with an explanation.  he then reacted very viciously that he does not wish anyone such a betrayed feeling.  he thought I was a monster. I just don't know what to do.  I find this so so difficult.  should i hold back any attention from guys?  I think that's so unfair because I enjoy it.  i want to be able to have the same experience as a cis woman.  am i a monster for not telling right away?  how do you do this?  i want to be able to go out without being heartbroken for days afterwards.	"You're not doing anything wrong. A bunch of guys are insecure and transphobic, and that's not your fault.
I'd honestly suggest to tell them when you're still in the flirting stage, before the kissing. At that point no feelings will be hurt (too much) if he decides he can't deal with it. Still sucks but better than getting emotionally invested and then hurt.
A few years ago, before I grappled with my internalized misogyny, I probably would have reacted poorly discovering I was attracted to someone who happened to be trans. It’s an unwillingness to acknowledge something inside of themselves that could be perceived as anything other than cis/straight. They’ve built their own identity around being “normal” and would rather deny themselves something potentially wonderful than tear down a pillar of their worldview. 

None of that is your fault. It’s a shortcoming of our society that will be looked down upon by historians in a “how did anyone ever think this way” fashion. 

But none of that helps you in the immediate future. So here’s my suggestion. 

Maybe a soft testing of the waters. If you’re at the party with friends maybe have one of your other friends bring up “So I was dating this Trans guy/girl (whichever makes sense in context), and [insert relative] was really uncool about it” 
That’s just a first draft.
It doesn’t really matter what the conversation structure is, but they should bring up trans anything and see how the person reacts. 

Unfortunately, it’s still not safe for trans folks to come out to strangers. And I definitely wouldn’t go home with someone who doesn’t already know, as it could turn dangerous very quickly.
Most cishet guys are insecure pieces of trash. I say it's better for you that they blocked you, you're dodging bullets even if it pains you
This is exactly why I disclose who I am right from the git-go: ""I just want you to know  I'm a transgender person, first, because I believe in full disclosure, and second, I don't want any drama later.""

If that kills the moment, then so be it. But better to have no emotional connectional all when you disclose the state of your genitalia than a few hours later when sparks have flown. 

Anyone who's childish enough to block you is unworthy of your tears. It's not like they're obligated to you in any way, shape, or form. All they have to say is ""I had fun, but I'm not sure I want to take this any further.""

So be up front. Always. I guarantee there are plenty of men who are interested in trans women It might start out as something of a fetish, but its often turns into something more meaningful. 

Good luck, GF.

Me? That's why I'm a transbian. Men are  mostly shallow and annoying, and I personally have had quite enough to do with penises...
If you think it’s going to go further than kissing I would recommend telling them. Otherwise why does it matter to them?
All it is is fragile masculinity, if that’s how they react then they don’t deserve your time anyway
These are just my personal feelings on the matter, but:

There is a difference between genital preference and transphobia. If someone reacts the way you described, that's quite obviously transphobia. It's something that person needs to understand and grow past. It's not your fault.

Genital preference, on the other hand, is more akin to political preference, religious preference, etc. Do you feel the need to disclose all of that immediately when you meet someone? If you do, then sure, maybe go ahead and add in what kind of genitals you have. But if not, then I see no reason to not treat it like any other kind of preference, and allow people to talk to you and learn who you are. 

Granted, what I'm saying isn't taking into account things like one night stands. If that's more along the lines of what you mean, maybe it's a good thing to bring up before you end up in bed together.
Personally, I would tell them that I’m trans before the first kiss. Put yourself in their place. If you don’t respect that they might have a negative reaction, don’t expect any respect in return. 2cents
Completely and utterly just my opinion: one should tell someone they're trans as soon as the conversation starts to become more than friendly and casual banter/talk. If you're at a party and you're talking and having a great time and maybe flirt a little bit...I don't think you need to tell them. As soon as the conversation becomes heavily flirtatious and both of you become a bit handsy (consented of course) I think you should at least hint at it. And definitely tell them before even kissing them. I know it feels safer to do it in the aftermath online but people easily feel betrayed by that. But you should never tell them in a situation where you're alone with them. Tell them at the party when a friend of yours is nearby.
So I would recommend honesty as soon as possible, cause the less you let expectations rise on both sides, the less you or the other person are hurt when it falls appart. 

I personally would not care what´s in your pants or how you were born (or lets say i would care, but not mind) but there are a lot of guys who do. 

It might be their right to think so or they might be jerks for it, depending on wether they react respectfully or make you feel like a monster. But in any case they´re not the person you want. 

Yes, some might hop right of that train the second you tell them, but i think that´s for the better. Plenty of fish and you deserve the ones that actually love you for what you are.

Aternatively, if you´re in for the attention only and never intend to get any more serious than kissing anyways... do they ever have to know? Just, like, in that case don´t give them your number and tell them you were just messing around. For them a girl that wasn´t serious and a trans girl who wasn´t serious, what´s the difference?

Disclaimer: I´m a confused but currently a cis guy, so i have no firsthand experience on this
I feel like you would only have to come out to someone if you're about to have sex,  some people aren't comfortable with certain genitals etc. But other than that,  you don't have a reason to. It doesn't matter.
A big part will be the environment and birds of a feather flock together, but in reality if they took the iniative to block you you should really let that go, don't say it face to face it's not safe, and you have every single right to want to be with a boy, it's only natural. Generally speaking dating is full of dead ends and it won't be different for you, don't settle just to have a man, but also don't give up, there's a lot of amazing open minded people sexuality is a spectrum and some people are more open to it, tons of people will love you regardless of genital situation, and please don't compromise your gender for anyone, it's hard but never hopeless, best of luck miss :)
I personally try to inform any romantic interest or partner that I’m trans before initiating any intimate contact or furthering a relationship. It is difficult trying to tell people when on one hand, I feel like I shouldn’t have to keep talking about it or explaining myself. People who you want to be close with on a physical level at least would have the right to know just so you’re both aware of the boundaries you set in a sexually-involved situation.
If you out too early, it's cool or they run and tell all the people there.

Too late when I thought the guy knew can be violent or funny but not recommended
They are not necessarily transphobic.

I have a trans family member who I love dearly, which is why I lurk here.

But one thing is bugging me about the whole subject...and this assumption of transphobia is one of them.

Who someone is attracted to should not be subjected to the same standards as, say who someone would hire to a job. Attraction is on a physical and psychological level and completely subjective for each person. Some people won't date other ethnicities, and that doesn't *necessarily* make them racist. Some people don't like underweight, overweight, blonde, brunette etc etc and some people won't date short people or tall people. And some won't date trans people. It doesn't necessarily make them transphobic.

I am a CIS man, and whilst I could happily have a close friend who was transman or transwoman, I personally would not date a transwoman, even if I was attracted on a physical level, simply because psychologically I couldn't handle it. My weakness (or insecurity if you like), for sure, **but I would not think** **any less of her as a person.**

This probably does not apply to the OP. If he called her a monster, then that is quite clearly not ok.
I agree with this. Even if it’s just as an experiment to see if she gets a different reaction. Avoid the physical intimacy, exchange contact info, then tell the guy on a safe way.

It sucks, but I can see why someone would be put off by making out with a girl, then finding out after the fact by way of social media they are trans. Hearing it from any source other than directly from her makes it far more likely to illicit a negative reaction.

In most cases it’s whatever, who cares, you’ll never see them again. But in the case where you actually want to get to know someone better, it’s a misstep.
>So I was dating this Trans guy/girl...

I think that's smart
""Are you insecure piece of trash?"" should be the first question she asks them
based
Do you think that people should disclose that they're trans to potential partners even if they're stealth and post-op?
>Men are  mostly shallow and annoying

Okay?...
I never go further than kissing. I am pre op. They feel disgusted when they found out afterwards.
Nah, OP is absolutely right to wait until she can tell them online. The exact sort of reply she's *already received* is indicative of how nasty some insecure weirdos can be about this, and by outing herself in person to the wrong insecure weirdo, u/Thisisfee could put herself at serious risk of a hate crime.
Thank you so much for this. The thing is I don’t know whether I want to just mess around or start being serious. I often realize I like the person after the kissing and yeah then it’s too late to tell them. But i’ll try to start connecting with them before kissing. I need to experience how they would react if I would just tell them.
I mean, I disagree with the idea put forward in your response that categorically labelling trans people as not being attractive to you solely because of the fact that they're trans is somehow not transphobic on the grounds that *the reason* you ""couldn't handle it"" is probably rooted in unfounded societal biases and stigmas surrounding transgender people, but that's beside the point here. The way these cowards and arseholes treated OP is *absolutely* transphobic, and that's what this post is about, I see that you undertand this, and so I'm not sure why you felt the need to leave this reply here.
Hi! I'm not quite sure what you mean. Mind if I ask a few questions about it?

1. Would you agree that attraction has two initial and primary facets: physical and mental? And that a lot of times, attraction begins at a physical level (you see someone you feel drawn to because of their appearance), but that it can also begin at a mental level (you weren't attracted to someone's appearance much initially, but they grew on you when you got to know them)? I feel that this is true, and because of this truth, it doesn't make any sense to say that you aren't attracted to someone just because they're trans. Because you aren't always going to know that they're trans. Attraction can, and often does, begin before that revelation. You physically see the other physical characteristics you pointed out, but you can't always see that someone is trans before you find yourself attracted to them.
2. Your wording feels a little.. wrong. I want to know if I'm misunderstanding, or if you mean what it sounds like you mean.. You say that you ""psychologically ... couldn't handle it."" Are you saying that you would feel repulsion if/when you discovered that the girl you found attractive had genitalia you weren't expecting? You mentioned that it's an insecurity - a weakness.

There is a validity to saying that you simply do not find one type of genitalia desirable sexually. However, if you feel repulsed, insecure, or any other type of *fear*, then I think you may want to re-assess your feelings/thoughts. Because that's what transphobia is. When you say that you wouldn't think less of ""her"" as a person, that's good! But it doesn't mean that you are completely free of any and all internalized transphobia.

I'm not here to call you out; I'm not even going to downvote you. I just want you to see what I see in the comment you posted.
> I have a trans family member who I love dearly, which is why I lurk here.  
  
Oh, by all means please argue with us in *our* space then!  
  
Quick edit: read the rest of your comment and can't believe you went with ""I would never date a trans woman even if I'm attracted to her"" when your whole platform was ""can't control who you're attracted to"" 😹
she is a woman. if you loose attraction to a woman because you find out shes trans you lost attraction because you now view her as a man. thats transphobic. ur just too scared to admit how you really think about us
I'm glad we have a cis man coming in here to tell us all about how not dating people because they're trans is definitely not problematic
>Some people won't date other ethnicities, and that doesn't necessarily make them racist.

You're right but what if someone is half back but looks white and they did the same thing and they got blocked because someone who made out with them at a party found out online that they were half black and blocked them that feels kinda racist. We are calling this transphobic because they block her and say nasty things specifically because she is transgender. The hate is coming from her being transgender so it is transphobic.
honestly, I can´t imagine what it feels like not being attracted to trans people, guess i´m to pan for that...

*having said that*

i don´t think it´s the big issue some people make it to be. 

Yeah you´re not into a part of someones identity but still respect them as individuals? I can think of many traits that would break the deal for me analogous to this one like someone being deeply religious or having strongly opposing political views or things as small as only listening to jazz-music etc. ... none of these are inherently bad, they´re just not for me.

imo no one is owed attraction. If it´s not there, it isn´t. Where are you going to get some from? And attraction can be broken by physical features you were´n aware of or a part of someones identity that doesn´t fit with you, which you just discovered. That happens a lot in any cishet on cishet relationships too.

*having said this bit aswell*

Keeping an open mind is important. You might run into individuals who you *are* attracted to even though you usually  wouldn´t be.
I feel like it's a non issue at that point, unless the guy wants kids, and even then there are plenty of permanent reasons a cis girl might not be able to get preggers.

The issues only ever seem to arise when a person feels deceived, that feeling comes when they find out about the genitalia of the person they are attracted to, they expected one thing but got/were told about another. In the case of a post op transfem at least(I have no idea about ftm srs results, never looked into them), unless the surgery was botched, the neovagina and neovulva is almost indistinguishable from a vagina and vulva. They expect to only find labia hanging, if anything, and that's what they find/are told about. 

The only potential issue I see is if someone from your past says anything.
Then I see no issue with it. Regardless of their feelings towards trans people, you had a good time and kissed a cute person and they had a good time and kissed a cute person. Nothing else matters
👏
I don’t think he’s saying it’s a genitalia thing. I think he’s saying he wouldn’t be able to date a post op trans woman either. That the “psychologically” part is referring to an inability to see trans women as other than men.
Yeah and I feel that same way with guys who I wont see anymore.  But sometimes I build up a connection with a person and I want to stay in touch with them. However, they won’t give me a chance afterwards and it leaves me heartbroken. It’s so difficult
I see what you mean. I just know that it's easy to misunderstand people's full meaning/intent online, and I wanted to give some benefit of doubt.

Also, I really hope he takes in what we're saying and learns more about himself as a result. <3
It can be like that! And if they are close minded like that then that’s their problem. Also if you do see yourself feeling closer that’s the perfect time to see what kind of person they really are
I think you wouldn't want to date someone who is transphobic even if you were cis. Certainly I wouldn't
That’s so true. I’m just questioning if I had a bigger chance into them accepting me if I just told them in person right away.
> And if they are close minded like that then that’s their problem

The unfortunate thing is that it sounds like it's also her problem
That’s usually not what it is in my opinion

little did my dad know...	"THIS JUST HAPPENED.
and I just needed to tell someone.

so my dad is a big weezer fan and since they just released a new album he’s been singing “i want a dog” non stop.

so he was in the kitchen singing (I could hear him) and then he came out of the kitchen holding our cat and going “oh my god I just sang ‘I want a dog’ in front of our cat and she looked so sad”

and then he went “that’s like if i were to sing ‘I want a son’ in front of you”

I am afab and he doesn’t know I am trans....


I just thought it was really funny"	"It'd be pretty funny to have had come out right there.

We must accept detransitioners	"There's been a lot of hatred thrown at detransitioners, and unfortunately, it's not just from places you'd expect.

Sadly, a not-so-insignificant portion of the hatred comes from within the LGBT community.

There's a widespread misconception that detransitioners are using their unfortunate life experience to spread hate and malice against transgender people. While it is very true that a few notable people likely have this despicable motive, the majority of detransitioners are not so deceivingly inclined.

They're regular, normal people, just like you and I.

It's difficult to face the concept that some people may experience significant enough regret years after transitioning to begin detransitioning. While they obviously do not make up the majority of transgender individuals, we're discovering that they may be more than outliers in a statistical sense, although more research is needed to absolutely solidify that claim. Reguardless of the ultimate outcome, detransitioners are a reality we must embrace and support.

The reasoning for the LGBT community to have difficulty discussing detransitioners is understandable. They've been politicized by conservatives worldwide as ""proof that transgenderism is a choice"" or that allowing people to transition is ultimately dangerous. A select few detransitioners have gone so far as to use their circumstances to promote that false narrative. Detransitioners existing in the first place provide a means of questioning and anxiety to many transgender people's solidified identities. But, reguardless of their weaponization by anti trans advocates, detransitioners that detransition due purely to regret (not due to transphobia, physical problems, etc) do certainly exist and we cannot ignore them. Medical science definitively proves the existence of transgender people. It likewise proves that transitioning is ultimately very effective at alleviating the mental stress of gender dysphoria, so much so that it is the current recommended treatment. Research further proves that successful, content transitions are most effective if started within a few years after the onset of puberty. In short, there is *undeniable evidence proving the existence of transgender people and the effectiveness of transitioning*. Of this truth, we shall accept no compromise and give no ground.

HOWEVER, we likewise must accept the fact that some people, despite feeling absolutely certain of their desire to transition for YEARS prior, do begin to experience regret in doing so even years after starting the process independent of the results of transitioning or the social acceptance of their transition. And, unfortunately, some of these people were teenagers when they started. These detransitioners are extremely important, because they provide evidence that research into transgender care is far from complete. As we rightfully push for easier access to transitioning hormones and surgical procedures, we also reduce the ability of the medical system to screen out people who's discomfort could stem from other sources and potentially be worsened in the future by deciding to transition.

The underlying point in this discussion is that *there must be more long term research into transgender adults, youth, and transitional care*. Does this mean we halt pushing for transgender care and awareness? Absolutely not. It DOES mean that we fully accept detransitioners and wish them well, reguardless of how their stories may be weaponized by bigots. It means that we accept the branching of gender affirmative care to not necessarily conclude in hormonal and surgical treatment. It means we allow further research into what causes people to transition to further improve the medical care of trans youth and adults. It means we embrace the idea that ""gender questioning"", or even fully transitioning, does not have to conclude in HRT and surgery.

While ultimately I understand that much in the way of this occuring is due to the despicable political landscape aimed at destroying trans people under the banner of ""protect the kids"", we still have to make the adult decision to accept that transitioning does cause life-altering changes that can never be fully reversed and as such is not something to be taken lightly. We're not those who hate us; our existence is based on medical science and evidence. As such, we must accept unbiased research into the causes of detransitioning  and how those findings may affect the concept of gender affirmative care. And, the most important point, is that we cannot hate detransitioners nor exclude them from our circles simply because they received an incorrect diagnosis when they were in highschool. After all, like transgender people, detransitioners aren't going to disappear.

We spread love, not hate, forever and always."	"100%! The only issue I have with anyone who detransitions is when they go full on anti trans and claim that all trans people are groomers and all doctors are tricking children into getting surgery. Unfortunately those people are making things extra difficult for trans and ex-trans alike.

Most of the bigots only need one example to fully validate their entire world view. There is nothing inherently wrong with being trans, or previously trans, and I have a huge amount of empathy for anyone who has had any kind of medical procedure and later regrets is. 

If someone involved in that process was incompetent or malicious, I definitely want them held accountable, at the same time, I absolutely hate it when it is presented as a generalization as opposed to their specific personal experience. 

I would never generalize my transition to anyone else’s experience, and I have complete respect and sympathy for anyone who is able to accept that their experience, no matter how bad, is their own.

I do find it especially frustrating that the bigots will exploit detransitioners to attack trans people, but they don’t seem to have any interest in fixing the societal problems that led that person towards whatever issues they had in the first place. 

They just claim that the existence of trans people is the only possible problem but somehow we are only trans because of some failure in society. It’s a chicken and egg situation except trans people are somehow the chicken and the egg.

We are the victims and perpetrators at the same time. If a detransitioner supports that theory, it becomes very difficult to support them.
There are studies already such as this one, which overwhelmingly indicate that most folks detransition due to a lack of support:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/
Detransitioners are important and their experiences are valid and need to be heard. But it is a myth that Trans people silence detrans voices. Detrans experiences are important to be studied to see what factors lead to them detransitioning so that we can work towards correcting those factors.
It is also true that a fair number of detransitioners on the internet are just trolls pushing their anti-trans agenda. Detrans voices are important, but often they are the only voices that some people hear, trans voices are important too.
It is a myth that trans people silence detransitioning voices in my experience. It’s also absolutely shameful that people try to lump in people who have evolved or discovered their gender identity is beyond a binary transition in with people who have detransitioned, and attempt to use them for their own agendas.
Trans people are generally acceptive and supportive of detransitioners. Unless you are a right wing nut you know that the point of the trans movement is being free to pursue what makes you feel more at ease, even detransitioning.  


But why in the hell are you making detransitioning sound like something that happens half of the times? We know the stats! It's around 1%! And it includes a lot of regret for complicated surgeries that governments impose on us in order to change documents.  


Also you're spouting transphobic points when saying that making transition easier will make people regret it.  


This whole post is in bad faith and you're doing no service to detransitioners.
does anyone else believe that detransitioners are still *of trans experience*? because I do. they transitioned TWICE for cryin out loud. I personally find it fascinating and would not ostracize them just for being detrans.

I learn way more about myself from people on different paths than I do from people living a similar experience. I value the detrans perspective because it oftentimes validates my transness
It's important to remember that there are different types of detransitioners. People who got so much hate they return to the closet, people who realise that their gender identity isn't binary, people who have health complications with hormones, people who realise that they are cis and probably some others that I do not know about.

There is no problem with detransitioning. Do what makes you happiest. Only issue is that detrans people get weaponised against trans people and some are outright transphobic. Of course these are in the minority of detrans people but transphobes know how to push against trans people.

Every detrans person who identifies as cis shouldn't speak over trans people. You do not see me talking over women as an ex-woman, do you? 

Also a lot of detrans people retransition later.
If we want society to be understanding, we should be as well. We're all different, but we're still human. Why treat others with the same hate or lack of acceptance as we receive? Thank you OP, for promoting the spread of love and not hate.
Nobody I know hates detransitioners. They are valid and a part of the community. 

The only ones I have a problem with are the ones that try to deny trans people access to healthcare or rights, who use their own poor choices to try to make our lives worse.
I'll respect them as long as they respect us. Too many of them immediately turn their backs on trans people and act like beings trans is a huge issue and should be resolved like global warming after they detransition and that's not fair.
Transitioning to your agab after having been trans outside of your agab is also transition. They’re not detrans, or ex-trans, they’re twicetrans. Embrace them too. 


Naturally if some individual is nasty and being hateful call them out. That goes for cis folks and trans folks just the same. Use your power for good.


But never assume you know someone’s heart just because they belong to a group that is sometimes used in propaganda against you.
This is bullshit. 
Get your gender exploratory therapy shill the fuck out this sub.

The unbiased research on detransition shows majority of the time it's due to lack of resources or social pressure. 

Anyone coming to this sub attacking ""gender affirmative care"" should probably just be banned. Toxic bullshit.
I couldn't read the entire post. I don't have the attention span. I agree with the sentiment of the headline though. Some detransitioners have been created and or used against the community, but there are so many who just are.  I know several people who chose, or are considering choosing to detransition. They were terrified to tell me, because they thought I would hate them.  Let people be who they are. Whether they detransition because medical transitioning isn't right for them, they develop health problems that make them have to, or because they can't take one more day being separated from their children/grandchildren because of transphobic family.  There are many reasons to detransition.   


We can fight back against the hateful detransitioners by spreading the accurate information. There is no need to attack everyone who says they did, are going to, or are in the process of detransitioning. We should not meet everyone who mentions it with instant hate.
I have no problem with de  . I don’t like seeing them let themselves be used as props by transphobes for 15 minutes of fame. I come to this thread every day and see children asking if starving themselves is a viable way to delay puberty.. and then see a detransitioner let themselves get used by someone who’s not even a doctor, anecdotally, to argue why HRT should be unavailable..
Alot or a few,maybe some trans people have no choice but to detranstion and we didn't detranstion because we weren't trans.

Alot of us do it because of fear,being ourselves in a alot of places can fundamentally risk your life and possible outcomes of choice.

Sometimes it's like knowingly going into Bloods territory wearing blue,it can be visible and you know it's dangerous,you might not get hurt that time but you might on another day but wear blue everyday and paranoia and fear eventually builds up.

people like myself just can't handle that and that's just being human.
[deleted]
Detrans lives matter too! 💗🦈✊
They just have to pass the same litmus test as any other human, are they being a cunt?

If someone detransitions for their own reasons, no problem. It could be financial, safety or social reasons.

If someone starts trying to weaponise their experience to spread lies and fear, that's being a cunt.
so well put hope this reaches people who need to hear this <3
I don't see a whole lot of hate for detransitioners. Most of the hate I notice is towards the ones who use their experience to attack trans people. The thing I notice however is that it's just not talked about much. Most likely because it's not a huge issue.

Detransitioners make up around 1% of the trans community acording the the studies I've seen, and 95% of that 1%, detransition due to factors such as; high costs, lack of medical access, lack of support, and other issues. I belive that less than 1% - 5% of 1% of trans people transition because it wasn't for them - basically they just weren't trans. 

Simply put, if one detransitions because it wasn't a life for them, that is completely fine. But I do not think they are trans. They realized that they weren't actually trans and decided to detransition. And while they should be treated with respect, kindness, and compassion, thinking of them as trans is simply incorrect. But again, I belive they make up a very small portion of the trans community and as far as I have seen, the detransitioners who do so because of the other issues listed above, are treated well in my experience.
I would say I've been seeing a lot of hate, but I have noticed a certain discomfort that some people have with those that detransition. I have very very much noticed that some people feel ashamed for wanting to detransition for different reasons because of the way the enemy (!) has used any and all of those that detransition to attack everyone. Of course, like I've told several of those that were thinking of detransitioning, forget what the bigots are doing because they'll just lie and make stuff up anyway. Their claims make no more sense if they mix some actual facts into their basis for it.

Now, you might think that loosening up the ridiculous and arbitrary requirements around accessing hormone therapy and gender-related surgeries would make it easier for people to rush to it looking for an answer that those procedures can't give. The reality I've come across more than once is that the gatekeeping and unreasonable expectations actually **increases** the incidence of people second guessing and possibly regretting their choices! I was surprised, too! The thing is that the bad faith obstacles that people put in the way distract from reflecting on the choice, because it adds value to actually aquiring the procedure, and it makes it more costly to reject it, so people will stick it out to see if it gets better. After all, they won't get a second chance from the people that don't listen to them and that they had to lie to.

I had a friend that had to go through a transphobic  psychologist to get HRT due to the country they lived in. It was a giant struggle with arbitrary waiting times, they had to bend the truth and tell them what they wanted to hear, in the grand tradition of our people. After a few weeks, my friend started to have some doubts. While I was pretty sure it was depression and anxiety messing with them so I didn't want to simply advise them to go back and burn their perscription, the right thing was to tell them to take a break to think about it. The problem, of course, is that it would show up on blood tests most likely, and there was a chance it could be taken away from them, so they had all this pressure to go one way or the other. It's the most I've been involved in a situation like that, but not the only one.

I'm actually pretty happy about the fact that bigots can't ever seem to do anything right, but it makes it a real bummer that people are suffering for it. The real irony about these weaponized detransitioners is that even when they're real people with real experiences, they're **still** creations of bigot because the bigots both but that false value on those procedures, and convinced them not to take responsibility for their decisions. Meanwhile, this lovely community has done a great job so far at supporting people that have wanted to detransition as far as I've seen. I definitely think that any hate towards the detransers is misplaced. The best thing we can do, in my opinion, is be open and vocal about our goals and values.

We're here to maximize happiness and satisfaction in people's lives, and if that means detransitioning for someone, then we're proud to help them achieve that. There's no shame in detransitioning, it doesn't feed hatred towards us, and it's all just another step in someone's personal journey through life. Hugs for all!
Totally agree. Not trans but as a doctor I can see the lack of care on people who wish to transition and individualised approach. If there is better education and counseling/planning, maybe things will be managed more appropriately. Making major physical alterations should be an informed decision and based on personal wishes.
A good point to raise here is about whether these people were not sure about transition. Or maybe partially had other reasons to question their gender. 
My wonder is if there were signs early that they could have been picked up and discussed prior to transition. 
I get often the feeling that we do not discuss the decision itself or know how to handle the psychological part of it
Since I announced that I no longer wanted to be seen as a woman, my andocrinologist and some of my 'friends' have unfortunately reacted badly to me.
It's transphobia those people should be criticized for, not detransitioning.

We shouldn't make them connected. We should be working hard to de-associate the two so people who detransition aren't guided to that pipeline.
We do not need to support a detransitioner going full anti trans ""groomer"" screamer. Reguardless of their attitude, however, we cannot be sending death threats and hateful messages. We are not the same as those that hate us.
It’s almost always due to social pressure and lack of acceptance or not being able to afford the costs.
While some studies do exist, none are fully comprehensive. A major issue with these studies has been too small of a sample pool, insufficient duration of study, or limited funding. Let's be honest; whatever the results of current studies, researchers are afraid to touch this topic with a degree of severity. Why wouldn't they be? Reguardless of their findings, the results will be twisted to suit an anti trans agenda simply because it includes the word ""detransition"". We have a significant of scientific and societal work left ahead of us.
Many detransistioners get rejected by their trans and lgbt peers and then get pushed into the arms of the conservative agenda where their pain is used as a weapon. This is a fact. The solution, then, is to make damn sure they feel safe and don't end up losing their support systems for doing so.

When someone leaves the trans experience we need to give them a warm goodbye.
It is absolutely an undisputable fact that detrans people have received hate, harassment, and even death threats from the LGBT community, and specifically the transgender community. There are Tiktoks of people telling detransitioners to ""shut the f*ck up"" because they're promoting hatred towards transgender people. I'm not saying anyone's voice is or isn't important; and I fully agree that detransitioners are heavily focused on to promote anti-trans political retoric. But hatred against them cannot come from us. It must be nipped in the bud *now* before it grows further.
it is not a myth that trans people silence detrans voices. I have seen it both online and IRL. sometimes it is directly to the detrans person. *oftentimes* the silencing happens in conversations between trans and cis people in order to validate the trans experience.
We don't even have the power to do that.
I'm sorry you feel that way. I have put significant effort into conveying that we should not allow transitioning to be more difficult or less acceptable, nor should we cease the fight towards making it even more obtainable. However, we should also likewise expect the statistical number of detransitioners to potentially rise in the next decade and as such we should do our best to continue to welcome them. If they go off the deep end with transphobia, that's a completely different story. But even in that case, while their message should rightfully be condemned, we should not promote hatred towards them to the extent that they receive death threats.
How many detransitioners have you seen do this? I find it hard to believe you’ve heard of enough specific detransitioners to make up enough of a data set to draw conclusions on. Being trans doesn’t mean someone is more likely to be a bad person, neither does transitioning twice. In short, you’re being bigoted. Stop it.
Double trans people can triple jump. We mustn’t incur their wrath. Because we shouldn’t be assholes, mobility isn’t a major reason.
Thank you for providing evidence towards my point.
Yea, it's pretty fucked up. That being said, many of them don't want to be weaponized by transphobes and are taken advantage of. I think there would be a significantly smaller portion of them that stray into that error if the transgender community fully embraced them reguardless of what the transphobes want to say about it.
Me too I'm +18 but still is uncomfortable.
I think in part this is a resourcing problem. To access hormones where I live, I have to be on multiple wait lists for a combined period of about a year (yay socialized healthcare /s). If clinics and psychologists are that overburdened, I don’t know how they can possibly do an adequate job of providing individualized, case-specific care

There is technically a psychological vetting process I have to go through to get permission to receive hormones (which I strongly, strongly object to). But there’s basically zero actual support.
Absolutely, and it’s really the anti-trans groups that are linking them together because they want us to turn against each other. It’s crazy how they are exploiting people by claiming that person has been exploited.
I'm still going to call them genocidal shills all day, because that's what they are.  Anyone who supports groups that want to eliminate trans poeople, allies themselves with fascists who want to eliminate trans people, they get no support.  They get called out for what they are.
A very small portion of the entire population goes trough with medicaly transitioning. And even out of that alredy small percentage, an even smaller one decide to stop their transition. And even then most of them donit because of social pressure and other kind of situatuons in their lives. So yeah, I do think that the people who transition and realize its not for them and then start pushing against trans rights are in fact representative of the entire population. I will accept them when they accept me too. I havent seen a single detransitioner be pro-trans.
Oh definitely, nobody should be sending death threats to anyone. The other day in a different sub someone posted an image depicting Trump almost fully submerged in quicksand or something, hand outstretched with the caption “what would you do?” I’m in the military, and barely survived his trans ban, but I would try my best to pull him out. Why? Because whatever kind of person I am dealing with, I am not going to let them determine what kind of person I am.
Not really true, it’s just a fact their are not a lot of detrans ppl. We should support the ones who exist but it’s true their is not a lot of them.
No one is afraid to touch this, there's loads of studies out there.

This is a good breakdown

https://www.gendergp.com/detransition-facts/
Bigots will never warm up to other people and accept them no matter what you do to them. You can give yourself up on a silver plater they will still think you are lesser and that you deserve to suffer.
This. We should validate their experience.  

However, we have to make clear they are a *very* small minority of people who transition.  Their life is valid, but they do *not* represent transfolk.
wait we should not tell people to shut the fuck up when promoting hatred towards trans people?
The thread you're basing your world view on wasn't statistically significant.
If we let ppl transition their will be the same amount of detrans ppl theirs always been, their has never before been bans on hrt like they are doing now. I don’t understand how you could think it’s ok to ban transitioning when that will literally kill people.
there's an ex marine who identified as a trans woman who had detransitioned and is now spewing transphobia and ""protect the children"" bullshit. can't remember the name though
No, I am not. I'm asking for respect in return which is more than fair. 

In fact, here's 3:

Helena Kerschner- used to identify as a trans man and now speaks out publicly against gender affirming surgery and states that  it ruined their life and will ruin yours too. 

Walt Heyer- a former trans woman who speaks out against gender affirming care and how ""harmful"" it is to youth and also uses their religion as a source. 

Cat Cattinson: former transman(?) Publicly speaks out on their platform about how puberty  blockers are harmful an extremely dangerous. 


I'm not saying everyone who detransitions is like this, I am  speaking about these kinds of people.
how?
There are definitely detransitioners who are pro trans, problem is you don’t hear about them much because the mainstream conservative media is only exploiting the ones who are willing or susceptible to be manipulated to be anti-trans.

Also I think there is a lot of stigma from all around about detransitioning, so a lot of them probably just want to be left alone and don’t talk about it unless they are pissed or exploited.

I think the most important point is that no matter what someone says, we have to be the calm and mature ones despite how angry we might be. For MtF people, this is what cis-women have been forced to do since forever. It’s the only way we have a chance of being heard.
I would save Trump not because of his humanity, because he has none, but because he's lolcow.
Ok. Idk what this has to do with accepting detransitioners, but ok.
We don't actually know how much of a minority they make up currently. While they are CERTAINLY a minority, they may not be as small as we think, whether you like to hear that or not. They absolutely do not represent transfolk, and transfolk are undoubtedly much more numerous than detransitioners, but their existence is proof that the codex for gender affirmative care is in no way complete yet, and that we must allow further research to proceed. We shall give no ground, mind you, but it's still important to find tune diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
The lense I focus my worldview through is analytical caution. I do not understand the meaning of your suggested ""thread"".
I don't understand how you perceived that at any point I suggested we can transitioning
You can add Oil London to that list now too
[removed]
I repeatedly made the point that gender affirmative care and transitional availability are not to be meddled with, only that the research into effective transgender care is far from complete and is having difficulty proceeding not only due to transphobic legislation and arguments, but also from within the transgender community itself due to fear and animosity that the already imperfect access to medical transition could be meddled with in the process. This understandable fear is something that we must work on ourselves to prevent it from stalemating the progress of research into transgender care. The above comment made multiple remarks clearly driven by anxiety that allowing further long term research into detransitioners may produce findings that do not support the current limited research that most detransitioners do so due to transphobia and not regret of transitioning at all. If encouraging research into detransitioners to potentially lower the amount of them in the future while expanding access to gender affirmative care is a bannable offense, then perhaps we truly are an echo chamber.
I could agree with this if it’s in a bubble that doesn’t include him having or potentially having the influence to completely ruin my life and put me in danger.
Nor do you know how many people are doing this.  Your evidence is fucking TikTok, a shitty spyware platform.
fine tune diagnosis of gender dysphoria?  


Diagnosis of GD is just however the psych feels that day, it's just gatekeeping at its purest.
Yes, we absolutely agree with your nuanced approach to this.
I literally didn't say a THING about that ? I said I will give them respect if they give it to me. Not that I'm going to demonize them immediately for detransitioning wth they're already going through enough shit already?

They are allowed to do so if they feel they need to. I am speaking of the ones that do that then act like WE'RE  the issue, that turn their backs on us.  Also I'm not going to sit here and name every single detransitioner that has turned their backs on trans people, you asked me if I'd seen enough to make an assumption (which I didn't do, I asked for basic mutual respect) and I gave you three easy examples. I'm not forming an entire anti-detransitioner opinion based on three fucking people. 

I don't  even HAVE an anti-detransition approach I don't understand where you're coming from on  this.
ah you say “I love detransitioners” but what if I replaced “detransitioner” with “transphobes”? it now says “I love transphobes” checkmate
It’s not, people are just pointing out the fact that a lot of detrans ppl do so bc they have no support. We should 100% do more research but their is alot of research already done. Education on trans ppl and letting people transition might increase detrans ppl but it will also increase trans ppl who come out. I don’t think their will be a huge increase in the percent of detrans ppl bc of that. If theirs more out trans ppl theirs more detrans ppl 🤷🏻‍♂️
there's decades of research behind gender affirmative care, and you literally came here implying things that have been studied haven't, implying that we need care that doesn't lead to hormones ect.  

it's bad faith bullshit, and it's pretty clear you're here to try to push some gender exploratory bullshit, which is just conversion therapy.

letting the patient/subject guide the care and attending to their needs has always been and will always be the only correct way to care for trans people. Any suggestions that we depart from that, particularly because of a cohort that gets elevated above the other 98% of trans people, is only advocating on behalf of the trans eliminationists.

just stop.
Trump didn't work alone, what he did was what the republicans have tried to do forever. Him dying will make no difference.
citing Tiktok as a source for hate speech is NOT the same as using wikipedia as a source for your thesis paper.
It was a false (pride) flag attack!
A shitty spyware platform that has remarkable popularity
Any occurrence of maliciousness towards innocent people from within our own community must be condemned.
 ...so you agree that it's diagnostic protocol needs work?
Proceed cautiously, but allow research to proceed. It's important that we do not become the mindless crowds of anti trans zombies puttering about the current socialscape
You immediately jumped to them being disrespectful. That was the ground state you were working from. That is not okay.
Lmao made me giggle
Lojik.
Exactly, he is just a figurehead or mascot for a whole entire horrible group of people. Honestly I don’t think he actually has any personal convictions or beliefs other than that he should be worshipped. It just happens that the type of people who are willing to worship him are the type of people who want us dead, and he has to appease them.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure the people posting negative stuff are really trans, but I don’t believe they represent the majority.
And?  So you ran into a couple stupid kids on TikTok, hardly cause for alarm.
That’s a very optimistic yet naive view of the community. Being LGBTQIA+ does not prevent you from being bigoted towards the LGBTQIA+ community. 

It’s impossible to get rid of all bigotry and hate. But it’s not impossible to atleast call it out in a lot of situations.
It doesn't need work it needs to allow us to self diagnose.
I think there is a counterintuitive issue with gatekeeping and restrictin access to transition.

For a long time there was one trans narrative that you had to fit to be able to transition. You had to say you wanted srs in order to get access to hrt.

That meant people lied and the strict narrative of what a true trans person was becomes a self fullfilling profecy.

So whats the story with detransitioners, and I mean the ones who realized they weren't trans at all. Did they genuinely feel like they were a different gender than the one they were assigned and then those frrlings changed? Did they somehow just convinced themselves they were trans? How did THAT happen? Or do you think maybe when a large portion of the community has a fairly high level of distrust of healthcare professionals that they get to a point where they will do everything, including lying about their experience to get access to healthcare?
Research is already proceeding, what are you on about?

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/
We are going back to college specifically to do research about being transgender, with a focus on transwomen with DID.  From there. Go into advocacy.   So yeah. We agree.
Didn't even once say they were disrespectful.  I asked for mutual respect.
They aren’t “being disrespectful” they are inciting violence. In Florida detransitioners literally flew out to try and ban hrt for anyone under 18. That will literally kill people. We should support detrans ppl but not transphobes. I don’t support trans ppl who act transphobic why should I have to respect someone who’s transphobic just bc they detransitioned?
I think the issue is that when it comes to being trans, there is no such thing as “representing the majority”. My gender doesn’t have anything to do with who I am or what I believe. We are all unique individuals who happen to have had the same birth defect. Even experiencing anti-trans discrimination is widely distinct based on your intersectional perspective and experience.
The concept of detransitioners has been danced around by a scientific community afraid of being accused of political motivations for simply performing more in depth and larger long term studies on the phenomenon. I am certainly not here to fight you; only to ensure that it is understood that we cannot make the same mistakes of those who oppose our existence. The underlying point I wish convey is that malice towards detransitioners from within the LGBT community is an actual, presently occuring issue and it needs to be recognized. Validating detransitioners is not invalidating transfolk, even if it should be twisted and presented as such by bigots. Even if that occurs, we will have our morality intact.
You asked for it, implying it wasn’t already there. You don’t get handed a glass of water and immediately ask for water, you ask for water when you’re thirsty.
Transphobes who have detransitioned are transphobes and should be treated as such, the issue is acting like detransitioning makes someone a transphobe.
Sure, what I mean is that OP seeing a couple kids posting on TikTok is not indicative of a wider problem with hate for detrans folks.
Nobody is arguing that detransitioning is not valid.  


Except for governments that don't allow changing back documents for example!
That analogy made NO sense to this conversation. It is not an implication to ask for mutual respect it is just a statement.
If OP said he ONLY saw a few kids posting on TikTok that would be valid. I think the point was that was an example that most of us can relate to experiencing in various places. It’s pretty clear that it’s not just “a couple kids”, but I would also certainly not credit it to “the trans community”.

For the same reason we can’t hold detransitioners responsible for detransitioned bigots, we can’t hold trans people responsible for transgender bigots. Being anti isn’t an inherent aspect of either “culture”. 

Problem is that anti-trans people will still generalize and hold us to that standard, so it’s reasonable for us to discuss ways to possibly mitigate it.
How often do you ask for things you already have?
I genuinely feel this is entirely blown out of proportion.  You’re going to have some people that get extremely emotional about the detrans issue, that doesn’t mean “the trans community” has a problem with detrans folks.

What people have a problem with is the rhetoric spewed by some detrans folks.  If someone detransitions, cool, they made the wrong decision, shit happens.  It’s still exceeedingly rare that people choose to detransition because they weren’t actually trans, and they need to accept personal accountability without making it seem like there’s some sort of conspiracy pushing people to be trans.
How often do you start arguments on zero grounds?


My dude, asking for respect from your fellow human is not implying that you believe the respect is not there, it is  grounding for comarardary, a sign that no bad blood be between the two parties.
That’s my point, it’s the anti-trans people who absolutely are going to blame the “trans community”. We can at least be conscious of it and maybe try to mitigate, or we can just ignore it and see what happens. The anti-trans people don’t use nuance. It is being blown out of proportion by the people who want us dead.
Again, you don’t ask someone who respects you to respect you, they already do. It’s not complicated, take a moment, listen to what you’re saying, and go take a nap you seem tired.
Okay, dude. Once again I'll state I wasn't implying they DIDNT. You cannot sit here and tell me beyond a shadow of a doubt that from both sides there is mutual respect because there absolutely isn't and it's sad asf. We bite eachother's tails all the time and we SHOULDN'T.
Get some rest. I’d be happy to discuss this when you’re a bit less irritable.
I don't think you'd be happy discussing boo with me since you immediately assumed I was demonizing a group of people"	zt1p1a	trans	149	0.84	2022-12-23 00:27:34
Mom in depressive state wasting life away because of my transition	"Came out to my parents 1.5 years ago, a month and a half ago told them I was finally starting to medically transition. My mother is very much against it. I first came out on a vacation and my mom spent the next day and a half lying in her bed just ignoring everyone and everything. Then I recently told them I was transitioning over zoom, and a similar thing started happening only worse. Came home for a visit a few days ago and it took over 24 hours before my mom even came out of her room, and when she did she didn't acknowledge me. We exchanged ""how's the weather"" type conversation over dinner, then she went right back to her room. 

She thinks I'm running my life, that this is the worst decision I could possibly make and that I'll regret ""mutilating my body"". I know it comes from a place of loving me and wanting the best for me (from her perspective), and that she's currently grieving the kid she thought she had. But this just sucks for everyone involved. She's so sad and angry about me supposedly ruining my life that she's letting it (currently) completely ruin hers, as well as any time we could spend together. I know this is far from the worst experience trans people have had with their parents, but this still just sucks and I wanted to vent about it. Thanks for listening"	"You are not responsible for the mental health of your mother. Repeat it aloud many times. You are not responsible for the mental health of your mother.

Best you can do is to collect up all of HER FRIENDS (not yours) and get your mother into therapy. She needs professional help.
It sucks to have someone in your life produce a concept of you that wasn’t the reality. My mom did the same. She started to lose hair and let go of herself when I came out and started transitioning. It seemed like everything I did to make myself happy only made her worse. That’s when I realized she never knew who I really was. She is my mom and I feel like certain  mom’s have this mission to know everything about their children to make them confident that they were raised by their standards. Her standard for me was to operate within my gender assigned at birth and treat me accordingly towards that. That made me think that maybe her heart break was because she felt she wasn’t giving me what I needed to become someone who I really wanted to be. That feeling of “My child is dying” because of a child’s decision to transition is a response caused by that image they were trying to build of us which fell apart by our own decision. That being said it’s a parenting delusion to conjure a concept and life path for children based on their gender assigned at birth. Ultimately, I realized it was much better for the two of us to separate. I’m a Filipina and I’m our culture family sticks together, but I had to leave to be who I really wanted to be. Now I’m happier than ever, but mindful that it was her mind that wanted to create a picture of me. And that’s the thing about pictures they’re shallow, but we aren’t. It’s not our fault people react the way they do, however no matter how far you go in your happiness there will always be people that feel the need to keep you down. Me and my mom don’t talk anymore, but since she’s my mom I’ll always have the door open for her when she changes her mind and gets better
No one’s happiness should be based on someone else - yours or hers.  You need to focus on your happiness and she needs to focus on hers and if anything seeing you happy should make her happier.  Someone blaming some else for their unhappiness is unwilling to look at themselves.
[deleted]
I'm so sorry about this. But this guilt trip is not healthy. Would you rather be sad and miserable for the rest of your life as long as she is happy? How is that love? This is your life, this is your time. If you are not ruining yourself then there is nothing to worry about. It sounds like you are old enough to handle things on your own. Just keep doing it.
I know for some parents they aren't thinking rationally when they act this way when one of their kids comes out as trans.
My trans son recently came out to me and was worried how I would react.
My first words were it took you long enough.
I realised my son was going to become a trans man when he was only 3 years old.
I had been experiencing that day for many years.
I love my trans son unconditionally.
I never forced any gender stereotypes on my kids  as they were growing up as they have to find out who they are and where they fit in in life on their own.
My son is 26 and his younger cis brother who is 23 has been extremely supportive .
Even his 67 year old dad is supportive.
I can't understand why my son was so worried about telling me.
He knows that I was the first person my trans sister came out to .
If a parent really wants the best for their child they need to be supportive matter what.
It isn't about them or what will the neighbors think.
Their child needs them more than ever, not to be pushed away.
It makes me sad when so many trans men and women face this kind of behaviour from someone who claims to love them.
My love for my children is unconditional.
The only thing I want for them in life is to be happy.
My mom is the exact same way, I had to decide years ago when I started transitioning that my well being mattered more than the way anyone else felt about it and I couldn’t keep putting off my life to make her more comfortable. She needs to learn how to accept things and stop being manipulative and that’s her problem. 
Hope yours comes around eventually <3 mine unfortunately won’t but I’m not letting that stop me from being the happy girl I deserve to be.
I need help because I’m in this position. I came out and my mom entered a deep depressive spiral and I feel like even considering transitioning is hurting her. She has told me she is committing suicide on multiple occasions now. I don’t want to transition at the cost of my mom’s happiness.
your mother sounds full of herself, she's acting like a toddler just because she wants to throw a fit because of how she feels about You doing something good for your own body.
She's trying to guilt trip you, and if she's really ""depressed"" about you transitioning and being happy and being yourself then she's a drama queen and a huge selfish narcissist.
I'm sorry that's happening to you, and that your mom is doing that to you. I find it admirable that you care so much about your mom's feelings even though she doesn't feel joy about her child's happiness and health. 

I think it's important to know your mom is in a depressive state and wasting life away because of *her*, not because of you. It's awful that you both have to experience it but I hope she eventually learns better and treats you better.
All you can do is help. Try to get her in on the ride…
My mom had a very similar less severe reaction. She’s the person I usually turn to for opinions and advice and just when I need to talk about stuff, but whenever I talk about anything related to me being trans, she gets this grim look on her face and the conversation instantly turns negative. I’m sorry for everything going on with your mom☹️
I agree with a lot of comments here that the mom is being manipulative. But i aldo believe the mom (person) can be in a denial state without intentional manipulation. I keep contact with my mom but i confront her with my opinions. Sometimes she cries and maybe i ease up. But i dont stop sharing the truth as i understand it, i hope to eventually establish a mutual understanding with her even if we disagree. You should consult professionals about how to proceed and do your best to follow that advice. However the way you describe it seems very rational. I can only say finding happiness can be difficult and when you find it honestly go for it. Do what you can to keep the people who matter in your life, but if they are not helping you succeed you also need to find reasonable solutions for them. Family is not always the most interested in your success. But being flawed is not unreasonable.
Someone already said this but it does need repeating...you aren't responsible for her mental health. You're responsible for living your best life...which is sounds like you are doing. 😊😊
I have seen passive-aggressive behavior before but your mother could teach lessons.
First off, I am sorry that you have to go through this as well!

Let me shed some light into a dark place, as well as share my story and advice... 
     My mother threatened me with being disowned in not so many words... Then tried desperately to guilt blame and shame me into accepting my AGAB

She is acting depressed and all, and still has issue with me, she has called me stupid, naive, gullible and ignorant all within minutes... has said it is going to be the worst decision of my life (and she knows that is not the case)
Now she is on antianxiety medication and other psych meds, and going to a therapist... the last time we talked, I know some thing that I will not put anywhere on social media, but I told her that she probably has some things in her past, that she has not dealt with, and that she has not slowed down enough to really know who she is without other people's voice in her head telling her the who, what, why, how and when... (she had to go... and got off the phone)

Going into my 8th month of HRT/GAHT she is finally using my name and pronouns, still messing it up, but at least trying...

My advice is show anyone who is causing you harm, that you are you as you are and have no problem being around them less, if they are going to hurt you, it may end up hurting them, but only because they do not accept you, and they are intern causing the pain!

Find a supportive friend group, and support group/therapist and try to not let others control you via emotional damage (that is abuse - 3 therapists have told me this, so I'd say that statement is pretty accurate) 

I may not answer right away as life does happen, but my DMs are open if you need or want to talk ♾❤🦄🏳️‍🌈⚧️ 🐛🐚🦋🌹
I don’t whether to give that an up or a down arrow. I’m just glad you believe I’m someone you can talk to. Anytime, I’m here. I’m on my second relationship with a transgender woman. So I’m learning as I go. I’m still very close friends with my first girlfriend. She was one of the first people I dated after my divorce, and she help me through a tough time. I showed her she could have someone who was a friend, and that she was   much more than just a toy. Watch out for that. That’s where a really great friendship started, might seem strange, but true. I so hope your mom realizes, really your gender hasn’t changed. You always were who you are. I really hope the right person talks to her. I have a close friend in the same spot with his granddaughter. He risks loosing her. That’s not worth it. I hope your mom comes around, because you have to take care of yourself. Avoid toxic relationships.
Thanks.
Thanks, it's nice to have that reminder. She definitely needs therapy (I've thought so for a while before this), but who knows if we'll succeed in getting her there
Agree 100%. Mom sounds manipulative af.
Thank you, it's really nice to hear your story. I'm really sorry about your mom, but I'm glad you're happy, and I hope someday you can reconnect. You're absolutely right and it's understandable but unfortunate and not helpful that parents often do that. I wish you all the best for your future!

Yeah, I'm not backing down on my position over this. I don't feel guilty either. I'm just sad that she's doing this to herself and our relationship. My dad doesn't like the idea either but is trying to maintain open conversation w me and I'm so appreciative to him for that. But my mom just shut herself down
Thank you, it sounds like you're a fantastic parent and a many people could learn a lot from you!
I'm sorry to hear about your mom but I'm glad you're moving forward with your life! Thanks for sharing your story
Your kindness and concern is admirable. 

However. Your mom’s stuff is some bullshit. What’s the next thing she’s going to hold hostage? “If you don’t marry a stinky Russian oligarch, I’m going to do myself in! If you don’t become a fish astrologer, I’m going to do myself in!”

I think it’s emergency mental health something for 48 hours if they threaten such things, right?

Your mom needs therapy. Not for you to sacrifice yourself.
Okay if my mom is manipulative yours is many times worse. Threatening to commit suicide based on the actions of another person will never not be extremely manipulative. Your mom needs serious help. I also want to point out that my mothers actions are not making me reconsider my choices. I hate that she feels this way, but that won't stop me from being myself. Right now you're putting your mom's happiness above your own, and she most certainly is not doing the same for you.
Thank you so much for the sentiment!
Thanks, and I'm sorry that you're dealing with that stuff too
Thank you, that's a very smart nuanced view
Thanks so much for sharing your story and providing support! I really appreciate it
The best thing you can do is get her there and however she benefits from it is up to her and her therapist. You’ve done nothing wrong. Being yourself is the best thing you can do. And the fact that you’re trying to maintain a healthy relationship with her and others in your family is proof of how caring and strong you are.
Not purposefully, I don't think? She just has a whole host of unresolved shit she needs to work through
Please don't pass judgment on people that may be suffering as well...

I get what you are saying, but that may not be the best way to say it.

Don't forget to always be considerate of others.
Thanks, these are powerful sentiments!
I could adopt you if you want ( even though you are an adult).
You sound like  you need a a hug and to be told that you are loved unconditionally.
It is your gender that is changing, not the person inside.
If you ever need to talk DM me.
If you're in America remember the time difference to the UK were I live although I'm usually still awake when it's evening in America and early morning here in England as I have chronic insomnia.
Thank you very much, that is really nice to hear
Whether it is on purpose or an accident, it doesn’t change the fact that she is manipulating you to do what she wants. In spite of what you want.
I have my own manipulative (formerly abusive) mother. This is the exact kind of shit she would pull to get her way.

Soldier on, OP. She'll get used to you or get used to not ever seeing her child; either way, it's not your responsibility.
Yeah, sorry. I’m not going to fall for that. I’m a parent of three teen children. I don’t know if you are or not. For most parents, the only thing more important than your own well being, is the well being of your children. It’s not a cliche. It’s real. And I cannot fathom any good way to interpret what’s happening here. 

If one of my kids was dealing with a major life decision that I was diametrically opposed to, the last thing I would do is go run off by myself, and selfishly refuse to consider anyone else’s feelings but my own. If I needed to process those emotions, I would do it in a way that didn’t hurt my children. 

And maybe you choose to judge me for that. That’s fine. Judge me all you want. But I’m not going to fall for this “but you don’t know all the details” crap. It’s pretty obvious I don’t know all the details. That doesn’t mean I don’t have the right to an opinion. And it doesn’t mean I don’t have the right to judge someone for doing something that I find offensive. I would love to be proven wrong. Because it would mean that there is going to be a better outcome than what’s currently playing out. But I’m not going to keep my mouth shut because of that. 99 times out of 100 this plays out exactly the way it seems to be going. Which is a contributing reason why trans people are killed, assaulted, and ostracized by an uncaring inhumane society. 

And if anyone is offended by that, so be it. I can live with that.
Thank you, this is such a kind gesture! I really appreciate the gesture, meeting goodhearted people online always fills me with a special kind of joy. I'm fortunate to have a strong support system in my friends, and a father and sibling who are dealing with my transition pretty well. So I'm actually doing alright over all. But I will keep this in mind! And I hope you are doing well in your life and have the supports you need as well? If not I'm returning the invitation to dm me, I've been told I'm a pretty good listener
Thanks, I'll do my best! And good luck w your own mother
I'm not judging you. I'm really not.
I don't know you, nor do I know your story.

However, as much as I understand where you are coming from, I believe you are not taking into account the mental health of the mother.

Depression can make even the strongest people shut down. It really does not matter how much of a good mother someone can be, if they are suffering, they can isolate themselves, or even worse, lean too heavily on their loved ones. And create a high dependency situation.

Mental suffering can take many shapes, sometimes it can make people act irrationally.

Blaming people that are potentially suffering is a form of victim blaming. What if one of your children acted like this? Would you be so harsh on them? I don't think so.

Never forget that in any unfortunate situation, there can be more than one victim. Communication is always key.
And yes, I have a son, and I love him more than anything, I would put him in front of me any day.

But even with that said, can I really say that I would think like that when suffering mentally and incapable of making rational decisions?
Yeah, I hear what you’re saying. But I’ve circled the sun enough times to feel totally confident with victim blaming a manipulative guilt shaming selfish parent. 

I’m also happy to agree to disagree with you. Because I understand that you have very valid reasons to have the opinion you do. And the only reason we disagree is because of the life experiences that we individually have had. And it’s even possible if we swapped those experiences, our opinions would be the exact same. 

I just find the psych 101 stuff to be condescending, and arrogant. I mean, you’re not telling me anything I already don’t know. Most people already know this stuff. Certainly most people my age. And quite frankly, a lot of this common knowledge country wisdom stuff is as crap as the common beliefs people have about trans issues. So if you want to disagree with me, that’s fine. But don’t assume that I’m too stupid or selfish to have considered other people’s perspectives.
I'm sorry you feel that way...

I don't want to lecture or be condescending.
Please have a wonderful day and take good care."	syfu4s	trans	148	0.99	2022-02-22 05:49:05

I hate being trans so much. //FtM Vent	"Just. I hate being a transman. I hate all of it. I hate not being called for who I am, I hate the reputation men have, I hate being doubted and judged, I fear all the future hate, and I hate all the trauma that’s come with it all. 

I hate that the people I’m close to “hate men” and say they’re all disgusting and I hate that I was exposed to that so early on. I hate that i believe it internally, I hate all my internal transphobia destroying me. People say the same things: All men are terrible. Kill all men. Men are worthless and are all the same. 
And sure, I’m a bit vain and sensitive and appreciate compliments when I can, but hearing that men should all die fucking hurts and I hate it so much. Growing up listening to people say men don’t deserve love, Ive grown to fucking hate that I’m one. Im fucking ashamed of it. Scared even. I hate being one. I feel fucking guilty of it, because of the horrible reputation that men have and that I must be horrible too for being one. I’m telling myself that what these people say are all lies but.. it’s hard to change smth that’s been instilled into you. 

Ive been told by my parents to “never be one of them.” When referring to trans drag queens. They’ll never forgive me for being like this, they’d easily kick me out if they knew. 
I hate that despite it all, the woman in the mirror isn’t fucking me. I hate that I’ll never be who I am. If I even know who I am to begin with. But I’m even more scared that if I do become that man, what if I still feel the same sadness and I’ll regret the choice? 

In general I’m.. I’m scared to be like this. To be a man. I didn’t ask to be like this. I didn’t choose to be. I feel like breaking down whenever talking about being trans, I feel like breaking down when I see my flag and having to see myself in it. 
I’m not even confident enough to say out loud, “yeah, I’m a trans man. So?” because smth inside me just... breaks. I don’t want to be like this. I wish I could turn away from it all. Or I wish I could have someone tell me “hey, it’s alright. Actually, it’s beautiful to be like this. You’re not bad for this. You’re okay.” Because.. I don’t know how much more I can take. 

I doubt this’ll get much attention, and that’s okay. Just needed to let it out somewhere, y’know?"	"The anti-men stuff is really harmful to trans people and I wish we talked about this more. Thank you for sharing your feelings.

Honestly, I understand not wanting to be trans but living as my true self is the greatest gift I ever gave to myself. It’s worth all the hardships I went trough even though I think it shouldn’t be that hard to be seem as who we are.

I’m genderfluid/genderqueer and outside the binary and my family doesn’t understand. I tough I was a trans men before and some of my family still thinks I am because it’s just easier for me this way and if I have to be seen in a binary way, men feel closer to me then my AGAB.

Sending you big big big hugs if you’d like some!
I'm transfem, I spent my whole life with a sexist family who hated men. I still feel like a piece of garbage whenever I interact with cis girls because of the things people made me believe about my self. If you say ""men are..."" or ""men do..."" just stop. It hurts so many people, and there's no reason to vent in that way. If your friends do this, call them out and show them THIS POST.
🤗❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🥰 
I’m sorry I don’t know what to say, but I think you’re perfect just the way you are.
My experience the whole anti men thing is just absurd like some kind of self sustained twisted badge of honor.""Oh, you like guys unworthy of me then."" RIDICULOUS Some humans absolutely suck period gender is not the problem how they live their lives and treat others is.The first time I honestly saw myself I just started bawling thinking please this can't be me just no but it was and is.All that angst wasn't about the beautiful person I could see trying to free themselves it was the petulant corrosive parts of society I knew I would have to endure to get there and exsist in.Those were and are honest feelings after witnessing others suffer it.I so understand.Just be the beautiful human you know you are the world can catch up or not.
People who think they're woke because they hate men piss me off. Men are also the victims of toxic masculinity. Women can perpetrate the patriarchy and be toxic as hell too. Men are people, they're individuals, they're not a fucking monolith. I think men are great, and I love being one. I wish I could somehow transfer the same pride in it that I have but sadly that shit can't be bottled. Why do I feel so good about it? Idk, maybe it's that I only hang out with people who don't say shit like that. Instead I surround myself with positive male role models, both irl, online, and in the media I consume. They are definitely out there. Men who respect women, men who are positive influences on the people around them, men who are intelligent, creative, and have a strong moral compass. You just gotta find them.
I hope it can be any consolation but I know (trans) guys that are genuinely the sweetest and kindest friends I have and you definitely don't deserve to have heard all the negativity. Men are great too, and so are you.
Back when I thought I was a man, I had a lot of the same thoughts. It hurt to hear friends say that they hated people like me. I still have a big chip on my shoulder about this. The existence of patriarchy doesn't excuse casual bigotry directed at men. 

But let me tell you: being a good man is a beautiful thing. It's not just an ok way to be: it's a great way to be! Yes, many men today express their masculinity in toxic ways. But that's not the only way to be a man. If you can become the sort of man who sets an example for other men with your masculinity, that is an amazing achievement.
Hey, I'm a trans man too and Ive been transitioning for quite few years now and I really just wanted to say this: the world is full of labels. It's so stupid and cliche but you're not just trans or a man or whatever. You're a person. And growing up to find yourself, and people who appreciate you for the path you choose on your own and for yourself. It's like the best part of life. Just trust that stuff will not stay still. Treat yourself kindly
Don't worry buddy, we all need to let something out at some point and we all have differents ways to do so. Just want you to know that you are valid as heck and no matter how you feel, we all are here for you
For what it's worth, those feelings aren't uncommon for cismen too. We're scared to be men, we're scared of being hated for being men.

It's hard to change what's been instilled in you. But what's hard is still possible. You don't have to say you're a transman. You can just say you're a man, and you define what that means by what you do.
I work with this guy, Jacob, man is a big ass goofy as fuck teddy bear. He has like 6 kids, a loving wife and on top of that he’s *THE* kindest man I’ve ever met. All he talks about is how much he loves his kids. He’s super patient with them, listens to what they need, and enjoys spending time with them. He’s the super supportive father figure we all wish we had growing up. 
His niece is lesbian, she’s also dating a trans woman, I think, and every time I ask about how they are doing, “Yeah their doing great. They’re both very happy, I love both of them so much we just really like hanging out.” I’ve wanted to come out to him for a while, but have decided against that for now, as I need to limit the people at work who know what’s going on in my life.
Everyone should take a page out of his book, as he’s the textbook example of what kindness is. No judgment, just support. I know a lot of people rag on men, even I have at times, but it’s hard living in a conservative area, where men are super toxic and honestly a lot of people around here are ignorant of anything trans or lgbtqia+ for that matter. It’s rough here.
You should t be ashamed to be a man. You should be the example that men should strive to be, strong, supportive, caring, and a beacon of true masculinity. When I still identified as a man, I was the worst kind. I was toxic, a homophobic, and transphobic asshole who bullied people so that they felt as bad as I did. I didn’t care about anyone but my self and my marriage was strained because of how toxic I was. 
You are an amazing person and I know that this is a rant. I want you to know that not all men are the worst just the ones who let fear guide them to do terrible things to others. You have the best perspective out of any man in the world, just because you know what it’s like to be on the other side of the gender coin so to say. Don’t worry about what other people think about men, just try to be the best man out there. Be the exception to the rule, not the example.

Edit: me no grammar good.
Im sorry you’re struggling. It’s definitely very hurtful to hear states that start with “all men this or that”.

I can relate about being scared or not fully ready to embrace being trans or some sort of genderfluid that I am. It comes and goes. Not that I’ve realized I’m 100% sure I’m not fully a man, I find little comments affect me differently.

Do you have any sort of a support system? My partner has been very accepting of the clothes, makeup And other things I try on at home.

I think as others had said we have to embrace who we are and accept that it is something special.

Good luck and I’m here for you if you need more support
I hate the kill all men thing, I often call people out who say it Infront of me and they often say ""not you cause you know"" or something along the lines of that and that pisses me off more.
This is the way my family is too. ""All men are assholes"" was a common saying in the households. The woman in the family would always get mixed with guys that were freeloaders, troublemakers, manipulative, lazy... And end up leaving their wives and children, not to be seen again. The blood-related men in our family are very depressed, and do not take care of their health. They usually die in their 30's to 50's wile the woman in our family live into their 70's and 80's. I grew up hating men and still have trouble trusting and getting emotionally involved with other guys, and even expressing my own feelings. It caused me to become in denial over being trans. ""Why would you want to be a man? They're so awful."" I would say to myself. Now I'm 5 years on T and had top surgery last year, 100% pass as a guy. Now I understand why the men in our family struggle with depression and confidence so much.
Same, man. I’m still struggling to release my connection to being a woman, not because I am one, even occasionally, but because that would mean I’m a man. I hate to say it, but I did grow up misandrist, and even before I realised I’m trans I was struggling to unlearn it (I think the process of unlearning helped me realise a bit I’m trans). Of course, I’m still afraid of men, so now that I’m a dorming college student I constantly have to misgender myself, because I’m dorming with all girls, and while I fantasise about being in a boy’s dorm next semester, I know I won’t, because I won’t feel safe, because there is no way I will get any kind of passing transition between now and then, even with T
Coming out, living as myself, it hasn't made me hate myself any less. I wish I could say otherwise. What it has done is let me be myself despite that hate. I'm sure I'll work the internal hate out eventually, time does wonders, but for now I'm just trying to live each day as me, not some random b***h I made up to use as a smoke screen.
have you encountered mars wright? he's a transmasc artist based out of the states and puts out some amazing transmasc-positive content. his instagram is @ mars.wright and everything he puts out makes me smile. maybe it will also make you smile
""cause you know, *you don't actually count as a man*"", right? That's it? That's what you really mean, right?

Things are really bad y'all, like really really bad. And they're only getting worse. But we can make change, we have to generate public outcry, call our reps, organize, protest, make the world listen. We cannot let these bills keep passing with relative silence.		"Not a legal eagle, is there any chance of these getting struck down in court? Hang in there all, and don't give up. We won't take all of this.
land of the free unless you slightly differ from the average
cis people dont give a shit about us. the only way ""public outcry"" is gonna get generated is if it starts affecting them too.
I sincerely hope there are teachers there who outright refuse to use pronouns for *anyone* just to make a point. All students just referred to as ""the student"" til school boards get sick of it. Just malicious compliance until they eat their words. 

The medical care bit though... that shit's rough. I'm hoping doctors pull together for a joint lawsuit claiming that it interferes with care and causes undo harm to the patients.
Yeah, we’re all silent cause we’re to busy fighting over a damn video game
Huge government overreach from the party of freedom? That's America for you.

I'd call my reps and sign petitions if I could but I'm European. I'm signal boosting all I can but I have zero reach especially because I haven't come out so I can't use my regular accounts. I wonder if there's any other ways I can help that won't out me...
I wager it's being challenged or will be challenged. It's an unconstitutional law and very discriminatory. As scary as this all is, I know that it's temporary. Rainbows always appear after a storm.
There is a case out of Texas that would ban the second drug used in medication abortions (which constitute a large majority of the procedures) across the country through a nationwide injunction (doesn't matter if abortion is legal in your state).  That would be a huge over-reach and assert judicial supremacy over the executive branch among many other things.  I believe that if medical abortions fall, contraception would be right behind.  I think that would be enough to get cis-people in the streets and potentially reverse some of this state terror against trans people <I hope?>
The drag bans are illegal under the first amendment. They are overly broad and don’t actually define their terms to an extent that would be unenforceable under legal theory. The medical bans for minors are less clear cut but still a good case since they are interfering with medical care. The one allowing people to misgender people in schools will stand most likely, for the same reasons drag bans are illegal. Unfortunately that knife cuts both ways."	10yax42	trans	142	0.99	2023-02-10 00:15:11

Transphobic family sad I've grown distant	"They are ""proud conservatives"" which comes with all the usual off-handed transphobic comments and jokes. I still see them as family, but it gets harder and harder to. It hurts so much to hear them say how much it hurt them that I've distanced myself from them, but then they don't at all respect my younger sibling's identity. How am I supposed to feel comfortable around them knowing my sibling and I can't even be ourselves around them?? I already feel so disconnected from them and every positive moment I have around them is becoming tainted by the memories of the things they've said. I don't think I could ever tell them who I really am, I'm scared to lose what tiny bit of familiarity I have left with them but I don't think there is any saving our relationship"	"We are your family now.
Sad that they've driven you away, such hypocrites.
I plan on cutting out most of my family right before I come out (still hiding). Though dealing with it currently and i want to scream at all of them. It hurts but it's making me push them away even further
I don't talk to a lot of my family because of things like this. I grew up with a highly reactionary family and over time I distanced myself from most of them as I discovered my queer and trans self
Tell them you will be glad to reconnect so long as they become full marxists /s
Same. My mother in law is such a negative person to everyone, she's already complained people don't want to be around her, and that's not even bringing the trans stuff into it. My wife and I had her and her husband over for dinner and he made a genuine effort to behave well, treat us all with respect and take part in the social occasion. My mother in law wouldn't look me in the eye, she wouldn't hug me, she avoided me and just made things so awkward.

My own parents also can't let go of their own ideas to see the reality in front of them. I'm surprised by how much this hurts, but I just can't see how being part of a toxic relationship will do anything but just make me feel bad.
I'm part of your family now
I know it sucks but you can't be familiars with people who pride themselves in who they hate. If you're a proud conservative, you're proud of being a willfully ignorant, bad person. It's my job to take care of myself. Surrounding myself with people who hate just me because they can't figure out how to deal with their own issues is NOT the way.

The second best thing I ever did was to become lonely, and learn to be my own best company and support. The best thing I ever did was to then go build friendships with a new sense of self worth and way higher standards as to who gets to hang out with me.
Ik the feeling, they get mad at u for not being with them but the second ur with them they insult u😔 smh. Atleast u have us
You don’t owe them anything. If you wanted to you can simply tell them that they’re horrible people, why they’re horrible and unless they change they won’t have a family.
I have the same issue. We’ve basically reached a happy equilibrium where I still “stay in contact” but I don’t actually tell them anything. I’ll probably cut them off entirely when my partner and I skip town.
The only thing that changed my conservative family was cutting them off. They wanted to pretend I wasn’t respectful of their beliefs, which I explained their beliefs cross my boundaries. They are mean, why would I want them in my life

We are slowly talking atill, I don’t have much hope they will change but at least they know where the line is
Before I even realized I was trans my dad told me if I was any kind of queer I wasn't welcome around ""his family"". Thankfully my parents are divorced and I have support from my mom , but as soon as I realized I was trans I pre-emptively went no contact with my dad. It's worth it to be happy in your own skin
eh fuck em, sounds like they are just sad they cant control you anymore
What I would do in your situation, is try and set up something to fall back on in case things get bad. And when I am comfortable, come out to them. If they don't like it, I have somewhere to go and be safe. But they may surprise you. 

I had a homophobic co-worker who was a firm conservative. But one day he came in with a pride flag temporary tattoo on his hand. So I asked him about it, and he said his son came out as gay, and while he was very against the idea at first, his love for his son was stronger than his dislike for the community. And after seeing how happy his son was and after meeting people in the community, he realized that there was nothing to hate. 

Basically, if your family truly loves you, they will accept you. It may take some adjustment, and they definitely won't be perfect. But they will try. And If they don't, then leave. If they can't accept you for who you are, then they are not really the family you need or want. 

I wish you luck, and I hope whatever you decide to do goes well.
One of us! One of us! 💙💗🤍💗💙
💚💚💚
I just wish they could see that maybe there’s a reason I’m drifting so much
It really does hurt, I don’t understand why they hold onto these beliefs so strongly. I wish you the best of luck 💚
I'm already doing so even though my mom accepts me she dislikes many aspects about me 
My brother to 
Some of my family members as well 
Imm going complete none contact with this entire family moms sisters are t supports and well I can't handle knowing that so im going to completely block everyone and delete contact information as well I don't even want them to know where I'll be buried it's that bad that I don't even want future generations of my current family members to know who I was or am I don't even want updates on them anymore I don't even care about them my mom or anything I have 6 months left and my therapist is trying to change my mind on doing it to cut them out for the rest of my long life as you can tell I will never forgive them 
The threats and abuse mentally and physically they all were involved in to try to change me 
Autism is one reason to why they wanted me to also forcing me on medication 
Threats were worse for me 
I will never ever want anything to do with this mentally messed up family again
Yeah, I expect something similar. It’s sad but I’d rather be happy than ridiculed by the people I trusted most
LMAOOO fr, I’d love to see the day 💚
People like that are hard enough to deal with as strangers, I’m sorry you have to deal with her in your own family. It’s sad how many people are so willing to be hateful for no reason
💚💚💚
As sad as it is, I know you’re right. I hate to see my family like this, but I’m not going to spend my life arguing on why I should be allowed to be who I am. My identity shouldn’t be a condition to their love. I’m glad you have been able to surround yourself with people who make you happy 💚
Definitely, one week my mom cried because my girlfriend and I don’t spend time with them. This week I hear her laughing at jokes about trans people and having political conversations within ear shot of us so we can hear all of their fun opinions. Thank you 💚
I wish it was that easy. They’re generally friendly, know when to not talk about their beliefs to strangers, and have the backing of pretty much all of our extended family. I would lose all of them, they lose nothing
I feel like there’s not much else to do, I don’t think they would change to keep me around. “I’m entitled to my beliefs”
Setting that boundary is important, I admire you for that. They are super strong believers in the “I’m entitled to my beliefs” thing, if I don’t get over their horrible world views, then I’m the bad guy
No one’s said it directly, but they refused to accept my younger siblings identity on several occasions, so it’s kind of a silent statement. I still heavily rely on them, California is so expensive 😭, but I’m just sad to see the people I grew up with just get worse and worse. I’m glad you have the support of your mom! Having people around makes it easier, at least I know I’m not alone
I’m definitely getting sick of dealing with it, but if this really is about control then there’s nothing that will bring me back
Yeah, I’m moving away for school for a bit, so I’ll hopefully find a nice fall back place there. But I’d be reaching if I thought they could surprise me. They were given years to accept my younger sibling, at the very least they finally accepted my sibling’s name. I hope for the best, but a crying mom and a yelling dad and brother are in my future. Thank you, I hope things go well too
Gooble gobble one of us!
Be straightforward with them.  It’s hard sometimes to have adult relationships with our parents but your relationship will either be stronger for it or not.  Either way, things will improve.
I don't know either. Thank you. Same to you
Because Christian conservatives believe that if they accept LGBT people for who they are, they're somehow betraying God. Ass-backwards logic if you ask me, and that's coming from a Christian trans girl. Jesus accepts us, just as we are, so if you're trying to be Christian, you're supposed to do the same. Just my thoughts, I sincerely hope everything works out for you
Don’t talk like that! You have value too! It sucks that your family can’t see that but they’re not worthy of you!
Then as they say in Russia, Soviet. They’re absolutely correct that they’re entitled to their beliefs. However, actions have consequences, and the action of “maintaining beliefs that are harmful to my child” has the consequence of “my child not wanting to be around me anymore.”
Exactly. I had to explain, “why would I keep people in my life that think I’m insane, that hurt me, that think horrible things about me, that miss the person who was miserable, that refuse to consider me”
And they would still try to couch it in language that distracts from the obvious so I had to be like “you’re mean to me. It’s not as complicated as “beliefs”. You think and say things that hurt my feelings. If you love me, how you treat me should matter to you.”
Just remember that they are abusing the shield of victim - if they are the victims then they don’t have to change - which means they will find a way to be the victims. Which is why every time you bring something up that hurt them it turns into a competition of grievances. Stick to the boundary metaphor, ask them if they would keep you in their life if you punches them in the face every time you saw them. Would it matter if you sincerely believed it’s the best way to greet someone? Of course not - being punched in the face sucks, your intentions don’t really change how it feels. If someone refuses to stop hurting you, or even refuses to consider that they are hurting you, then they need to go. That’s abuse.
Yeah, I know I’ll have to say something eventually. Whether they accept me or not, I’m not going to stick around people who don’t think I should exist
I don’t know if it’s better or worse, but they aren’t even religious anymore. They grew up Mormon but God doesn’t come into play when they make decisions anymore, as far as I know. Whatever prevents them from accepting LGBT people is all them. The rest of my family though, could learn a lot from you
Thank you 💚 I’m just wishing I didn’t feel like my choice was happy family or being myself
I just hope they view having me in their life as a better alternative to being transphobic
I’m not looking forward to that conversation, there’s no winning with them. I guess o can get a lot of practice and advice here before hand, so thank you 💚💚
Thank you, this helps so much! They love arguing but I’m terrible at it. I hadn’t really considered this approach, thank you 💚💚
I hope so too hun 🤗

40,000 with out electricity	"Hey if you are from NC then you have heard 40,00 people are without power because some yahtzees decided to shoot up power transformers to stop a drag show that was happening in the county If you haven't noticed it is winter and nc all though in the southern US it still gets cold. 

I wanted to put this here and a heads up that these people will distable a city to prove a shitty point. We keep each other safe. Start being more discerning about the people you can have in your life. We need to make a stance together that this is not how LGBTQIA+ community will be treated.

Yeah. It’s terrible.
Damn, reasons like that is why I hate living here so much. North Carolina's full of racist, homophobic, religious nuts who can't comprehend anyone not being exactly like them.
Can I have a link that says they did it to stop a drag show?
Some of my extended family, who was recently separated from my nuclear family by the death of my great grandmother, live down in NC. Now I have more reason to not ever visit them.
I'm in NC and it's very saddening what happened. It's getting more Unsafe by The minute.

i hate living in this state where proud boys are fucking allowed
More like exclusively negotiates with terrorist and then use the “we don’t negotiate with terrorist” in order to not have to negotiate with a country that we actually just attacked for no reason looking at Iran and like half of all South American countries we do proxy coups in

Can confirm
https://www.metroweekly.com/2022/12/anti-drag-activist-claims-god-is-behind-north-carolina-power-outage/
 
- ""Not long after the outage, a conservative activist made a cryptic post on Facebook stating, “The power is out in Moore County and I know why.”

The author of the post, Emily Grace Rainey — who has become known for espousing conservative causes including opposition to drag-themed events — claimed in a subsequent Facebook post that “God will not be mocked.” The post included a photo of The Sunrise Theater in Southern Pines, N.C., where “Downtown Divas,” a drag show, was slated to be held at 7 p.m. on Saturday. 

There is no evidence to suggest that Rainey was in any way connected to the attack, or that the attack on the power substations was related to the drag show, Fields said during his Sunday press conference.""

This woman was also seen with proud boys at protest at another drag show in Sanford a couple weeks ago I can find quote and link to article enclosing that detail as well. They used guns to take out transformers.
You know that good ol' GOP motto: If the terrorists are white, then they're entirely alright.
What? Patriots? I don't think so they don't deserve to be called Patriots

Played my first gig the other weekend since coming out and starting my transition (live streamed sadly) but felt good :) what do yah think of my outfit ?		"All I need to say is that most cis people could never. (You look bomb as fuck!)
Pretty awesome!! Beautiful bass as well, I play a 5 string jazz
You look amazing! Awesome bass too, I have the same one
You look so good! Trans women playing bass is apparently a running theme and I’m here for it
The fit is cool as well as that jazz bass
Your outfit is fabulous, (actually its You+outfit that's stunning),  and you have also chosen the best bass. I love Jazz basses.
I love the outfit, but also the color scheme on that bass! 😍
Yeah, definitely envying both the fit and the bass. BUT ALSO CONGRATS ON YOUR FIRST OUT GIG!!! I didn’t come out until after my kid in a van life, and regularly think about what it would’ve been like otherwise."	o6wpxe	trans	136	0.99	2021-06-24 08:30:25
Waa 😫 😭🥺 I’m so sad I’ll never have wide hips. I wish I would’ve started transitioning sooner for SO many reasons 🙇🏽‍♀️		"To be fair, almost no cis girl can pull off a bodycon dress either for various reasons… Go for an A line dress with a bit of volume at the bottom (built in hips, works for cis girls with no hips too!) and you will look absolutely fabulous!
Hard for most girls to pull off a bod-con dress, but your legs are killin it!
Still look good. There is a new type of surgery that makes your hips wider in South Korea. It is still not available but seems like a very reliable solution. What it does it adds extra structure to your hip bone, which makes your hip wider. Anything on your hip area will be wider. I personally think it’s a good solution if hip growth doesn’t happen.
But you still look gorgeous hun! Your legs look amazing 🥰
I didn't have hips before HRT, and I still don't, but it gave me massive thighs and big ass, which kinda works. But I am also 17 months on HRT. I don't know what your metabolism is like, but it is possible to get more curves still. It's certainly doing something for your butt!
you are so beautiful and many other women share your body type. dont ever get down on yourself about it. also, dont say never because there are always medical transition options if thats something you would like to pursue!!

also your makeup is so good!!! your eyeliner looks amazing
That could change over the years, but great figure over all. I see you post a lot, and I'm always a fan of your hair and eye makeup too. Of course, being a hot woman isn't everything, but you got it! Best of luck on your hip growth/surgery options in the future. There's still hope. 🙂
Saaaame 💖💖💖 ughh I just wanna be beautiful 😖
Cute butt
You have amazing curves tho!! Wide hips are cool but you look awesome!!!
You look so gorgeous!
Oh honey you're Beautiful and so feminine 💗💗💗  I wished I lived in Washington you could live with me!
Try going for more flapper inspired looks ! A lot of my cis friends who have your body type love them.
nice body and legs
True, I’m also gaining weight in my stomach right now, which is causing me to lose my figure a bit but also giving me a really fat ass lol
I used to do alright but gaining some weight in my stomach is making me a little less curvy in some areas and more in others lol
I was reading about that, I haven’t heard much results though so that concerns me
Aw thank you!🥰
I need to work out more. My metabolism has been slowing down considerably since started HRT but I also don’t work in a physically demanding job anymore that basically prevented me from having the time to eat a lot. Now I’m just fucking hungry 24/7 lol
Omg I so hope my hips haven’t closed yet but at 31 it’s probably unlikely. And tbh with you, I’m a massive attention whore so it makes sense you see me on here a lot lol 
It helps my days when I feel ugly…which is like, a lot lol
Right?? Is that so much to ask for? Lol
Awe omg thank you so much!! 🥰🥰🥰 I’m glad that I have something. I guess this first pic just made me realize how little hips I have. But I’ve also gained a considerable amount of weight in the last few months and haven’t been working out. 😬
Well other than that, you still look gorgeous. I personally am not on HRT yet, I’m been on a long waiting list 😭😭😭😭.
Oh no! You should try planned parenthood, I waited a month to get my first appointment. I’ve been on her for 6 months now and I’m going to be switching to injections tomorrow.
Yes I have heard of planned parenthood. Its just that I am located in Canada and health care is so SLOW! It’s definitely not a problem for me to move to the US because I will be moving in with my American BF and soon be his wife. 😊
My BF is so supportive from the beginning when we meet before I was trans.
Injections sounds scary, I have such a low pain tolerance. 😭😭😭
I’m a little worried about how it’ll go tomorrow but I’m excited none the less.

Why don’t any Trans-Masc posts seem to be very popular?	"I’ve been on this sub for a few months now and as a trans-masc person I’m always seeing trans-fem posts getting lots of awards and attention but haven’t seen any trans-masc people getting the same attention :/ 

i love it & i love the support but i can’t help but feel a little sad or let down that i’m not seeing anyone like me getting the same kind of attention as trans-fem individuals."	"Transmasc here and I totally get you lol. That's why I mainly post on r/FtM now, as well as I support everyone from every gender spectrum, I can get your feel too to feel erased in the trans community.
I’m MTF and feel the same! I support all and love seeing trans masc, ftm posts. So don’t feel sad. I support you 🙂
I think it’s because the trans community is well aware that overall, it can be harder for transfem individuals to “pass” than Transmasc individuals. This can cause transfem individuals to need more support and encouragement in their journey, because they are at a higher risk for being noticed in public. Transfem individuals also tend to be more vilified on average than Transmasc people. It’s sad that “passing” is a double edged sword, and that in many cases it’s really important for some, and easier for others. (Please note that these are all averages) So yeah, I think it’s because the community is more focused on transfem individuals due to their visibility in society as a whole, but also because we’re subconsciously aware that transfem individuals have a slightly harder time “passing” and can need a little extra encouragement to feel good about the way they look and feel. (Please note, that all of this is conjecture as well, and opinion. If anyone else has a different perspective, I would love to hear it.)
There’s more transfems in this subreddit probably. It’s funny, because as a non-binary person I struggle with not seeing a lot of amab enby representation, I guess it’s nice to know I’m not the only one feeling left out.

It could just be that transmascs need to be more active on here lol. Nothing really gets upvotes on here that Isn’t a selfie anyway.
Afab enby here, it’s kind of alienating with most of the posts being transfem and the occasional transmasc. It’s always nice to see ftm posts as I relate to them more and it would be nice to see more, there might just be more transfem users on this subreddit
I upvote everyone equally, i just don't see that many transmasc posts
My theory is that MtF have lived a life of not really receiving compliments so as they transition they in general tend to crave or go out of their way to find more affirming comments on looks, while FtM have had to deal with it most of their lives. Personally I love seeing any FtM timeline posts as it makes me feel better about myself as a MtF, I generally don't put out an aura of femininity because I don't want anyone noticing me and this makes me question what I'm doing and if I'm just lying to myself. After seeing posts with someone who's FtM  and their all dolled up in the past gives me confidence that the way I act and dress is a normal state of being/transition. Sorry if that rambling makes no sense lol
Can I add the aside that the ONLY men I've ever been attracted to are trans masculine? It came as a bit of a shock at first, because I've never even liked being around men, but a trans guy? It's a different story.

It's not even about the plumbing bits, because the first time it happened, I didn't know he was trans, and I was left wondering why this one particular guy didn't cause the hair on the back of my neck to stand up just before I hissed at him. Honestly, I think it's tied to the fact that trans guys do masculine without a heavy side of toxic. And, that just gets me going...

Of course, I'm married and our relationship is not ""open"" and I have enough self control to not act on the attraction, but I think it made me understand what cis girls see in men.
Hey as a transmasc adjacent person this is kinda nasty. maybe consider that there are just more transfem people on reddit than transmascs/ there are tons of transmascs on tumblr and transfem people are constantly silenced overthere. Also this isnt a support reddit, its just a social place for trans people. complaining that you're not getting enough attention is shitty especially considering that world is a much more hostile place for transfem ppl and that maybe there are less websites that might be welcoming for them. im sorry you feel bad but just go to a transmasc specific sub or something.
Transfem are the ones where it's MtF, right?
If so, people be simping, apparently.
I think trans fems get more attention for a specific reason:
Society favors fulfilling mens interests and fetish’s.
This attitude permeates.
I would assume theres some tranny chasers on this r/
I was just asking myself the same question. I’m transfem, but I want to hear about all of you on the other sides of our little community! Where did all our brothers go and how come we don’t hear from them?
Not entirely sure really. I'm MTF, but I fully support anyone wanting to ride that train the other direction, or even in an entirely different direction. Love you all! 💕 😘
it’s just really discouraging to see overwhelming support for y’all but like none for us ):
This is very true as well. The FTM posts I see most of them pass and the voice changes on T. It’s such a powerful hormone that we have to basically counter and a big thing is blending in society which can cause a lot of anxiety. Regardless, everyone deserves support bc we are all so misunderstood by society as a whole. Strength in numbers, unity and support is key! ☺️
and i totally get that, i make an effort to be verbally supportive especially with posts on here but i feel like all trans people need that encouragement to some degree. 
i’m definitely lucky that i’m more masculine so I pass “easier” than some trans-fem or even trans-masc individuals but that doesn’t mean that we’re not in need of the same level of support :/ it just feels like this subreddit is mainly dedicated to mtf (or trans-fem) hype posts and it hurts a little bit. 

i understand and don’t hold any grievances but of course i wish it was a little less one sided.
i feel like your language used is a little bit uncalled for as i never once said anyone is more deserving of attention #1. I never disagreed that there is a larger population of trans fem people on here & wasn’t negative in any way but here you are trying to make me feel bad for sharing how i’m feeling?

This is a Trans subreddit, and I was curious as to what the reasons may be behind this specific thing. You’re literally the only person that has an issue with my post, and it’s not even about “me” getting the attention. 

it’s about me wanting to see more people that aren’t just trans fem, just like any other person would like to see more people like them represented. 

edit: i don’t have an issue with trans fem people, i love and support them just like i would anyone else - but i also wanna see more trans masc representation. i’m not saying it’s gonna happen, but this is a good sub for conversations such as this. 

“just go to a trans masc specific sub or something” i’m already a part of other trans subs. that’s not the issue here. it’s not even a just me issue. other people feel the same way if you’ve checked the comments. 

i’m having trouble understanding why you’ve taken such an issue with anything i’ve said here.
I think it’s just English speaking society prefers idolizing women over men, even if that women is trans 🏳️‍⚧️.
[deleted]
Everyone does need support - I think Alastair is making a valid point though. Transfem people are at higher risk for violence - they are more likely to be the target/victim of an assault or violent crime. They are also villified in society - how often do we hear about “men” dressing like women to get into women’s bathrooms? I’ve never once heard that “women” are dressing like men to get into theirs. Because sexism & misogyny are so rampant, there is greater risk in being transfem. Obviously there are risks being trans anything, but MtF have a harder time in society in general on lots of levels.
I agree. I think the best way to do that is make an active effort to post here more. And I really do feel that a lot of this stuff is completely subconscious that people don’t even realize they’re doing.
actually people who dont or cant pass do need more support than those who can. being stealth isnt a comfortable place to be, but it is a privilege that many transfem ppl dont have access too. transmasc ppl are constantly forgetting the axis of safety that they are able to access that just does not exist for transfem ppl
I mean you say you're just curious about the reasons behind more transfems being present on the fp of this sub, but when people give you that information you continue to talk about how bad it makes you feel. i have issue with this bc it come across as guilt-trippy which i find to be in poor taste given the fact that the population you seem to be guilt-tripping is a more historically vulnerable group than you. i think there is a problem of entitlement among the transmasc community that is frequently ignored, and understanding the privileges you have and how your actions/words may affect others who don't have the same privileges is important. yeah other transmasc might feel the same as you, i think they should think about this too

im not telling you your feelings are wrong, im saying that the way you are going about this is off and if you have grievances, you shouldn't be airing them in way that specifically targets the transfem people on a sub that you have issue with

edit: also im sorry you have problem with seeing the word shitty on the internet. get better soon ig
Insta definitely has more transmasc rep but I'm out here for you kings y'all are killing it and I'll do my part better to hype you guys up on Reddit because you deserve it!!!
I never disputed those points because i genuinely agree. 

Those points don’t make it any less invalidating for trans masc people to not receive much support while trans fem people get tons of attention/support. 

They deserve it, i’m not saying they don’t - but we deserve it too. we need validation and support just like anyone else. each transition comes with its own ups and downs

so when i post something to this page looking for some support or validation and only get like 2 comments and an upvote meanwhile a girl just posted a selfie 10 minutes ago & already has 100 comments. 

it doesn’t feel good. and i think that’s fair for me to share, i’m not shaming anyone or saying transmasc individuals have a harder time bc we typically do not.
which is absolutely fine but trans masc people aren’t getting the support they need because there’s such an influx to making sure trans fem people feel good about themselves. 
which they absolutely deserve. 

once again, i just wish it wasn’t as one sided. like you can’t have one without the other
It’s absolutely fair and in no way was I trying to say it’s not. I was only offering an expansion on *why* transfem people might get more support. I thought it might help to consider it from that lens, by showing that it’s not personal to you or any other FtM person. It wasn’t my goal to invalidate you. I’m sorry you don’t feel very supported on here. It might not be the best forum - there are more specific subs and Instagram seems to have more FtM. I think just by you posting and having others post more too will help! It seems to be the general trend that FtM isn’t as visible/ supported (thankful for Elliott Page!) and that AMAB non-binary people experience that too.

*edit to add someone else said it, but they are right that selfies are the only posts getting lots of upvotes. That drives me crazy because I’ve posted here and on non-binary looking for support and it doesn’t get much notice, but a random selfie with no reason/ text is upvoted to oblivion.
not everything is going to be completely balanced, different sites have different demographics. if you want to be surrounded by transmascs or feel more supported go somewhere else like a different subreddit or website. demanding the attention and resources of transfems because it feels unfair to you is childish and ignores the fact that transmascs have privileges that transfems dont and because of that reality this subreddit is an anomaly. this sub is one of the only trans focused places that i have seen more transfems than transmascs, so it shouldn't be hard to find something else. literally all of tumblr and insta is transmascs"	knsm3c	trans	130	0.98	2020-12-31 16:06:49
I dont feel happy anymore after becoming trans	Last year early summer I realized that I'm a trans woman and I started having a lot of sad moments and dont feel happy at all, especially now. I have a fear that I will never get accepted by friends and especially parents, since they are really against LGBTQ+. My parents always judge me for being friends with trans people and tell me that they are just sick people. My country isnt really supportive against trans people either. Dyshporia really badly hits me everyday and I wish so badly I would just be born a woman,  so I wouldn't go through these problems and stress. I have daily suicide thoughts on my mind and I can't help them. I dont have many friends after I came out and I cant really talk about this problem to anyone. Thank you for listening to this.	"I'm so sorry hun. You deserve to feel happy. I think you can be, based only on two things I know about you: you were brave enough to come out; and you have the courage to come on here and explain why you're unhappy. I'm glad you have at least a few trans friends. I wish I had a couple trans people in my daily life I could hang out with.
Hi, I'm really sorry you feel this way. I think most people feel this way after realizing they are trans cuz of dysphoria and unaccepting environments. 

 I wish I had friends irl who were trans. The area I live in doesn't have very many trans people and I don't feel safe coming out to most of my family yet either.

Please call or text a suicide crisis line if you can. You deserve to be happy.
Thanks for posting here to express yourself. I hope this and other trans communities can be helpful to you.

Please reach out to someone or some group that can help if you are having thoughts about suicide.
When you feel lonely you tend to start questioning everything: Am I doing things right? Do I deserve this?

You'll burn yourself out. Instead look straight into your problems from a different perspective -- in the future perhaps. What if with enough time you'll one day see yourself in a mirror and finally came what you've always dreamed of? Even the slightest progress. ""If I were to disappear, how am I sure that I wouldn't be happy in the future and have my life figured out?""

If everyone leaves, you still have you. We're only here not to speak cute advices but to show you how powerful you can be in changing your life. You're in control, remember that. :))
I'm in a similar boat, but personally, I have hope that one day the endless self-hated, shame and negativity will end because one day I'll learn how to truly not care what anyone else thinks of me, when that happens I won't be in pain anymore.
Well I’m here and I’ll be a friend no judgment from me. Let’s find you some happiness though. So what would you like to change about what is going on with you and why? How could others help you with your struggles? Where could you find yourself living your best life, is there a state that is more accepting of your found gender? And you’ve made a very brave choice in life don’t give up now. You can make it you just have to find your people. There are so many people in this world you are not alone. Pm me if you want I’m open for the chat. Best wishes and love to you. Hugs
I think what would be good for you is to distance yourself. Right now you are in the middle of everything so your perspective is limited.

My case for example: when I was 18 I went on an exchange program to Japan. It gives you a new perspective of the world, when you leave your small community.

I suggest you do the same, leave the trans thing alone for now. Visit another country. Feel free from the toxic ties that you left behind. Pave your own path.

Canada has excellent trans health care. If you are able to explore some school or work in Canada you would be moving in a really healthy direction.

Unfortunately, not much you can do about unaccepting family. Build a new circle of people you like and love and let go of those who can't accept you. After you've transitioned and ""pass"" maybe your family will turn around? Who knows.
I'm with everyone here, huge huge hugs.  Its is really sad initially when you fully realize you're transgender and what it means.  When I was younger and realized what was going on with me I was TERRIFIED.  It absolutely broke me in two and I buried what I was feeling every day.  I should have told my mother right away, but I was afraid of what others would think and never being happy.  

I can't imagine being in an unaccepting country though. But looking back our country wasn't accepting at the time either... and its only because some brave transgender people came out, that others now have an easier path.

I'm not envious of those brave people who come out early in their countries when the hate, misunderstandings, and judgement are the worst.  And I give huge huggles out to all of you out or not dealing with your feelings and a less accepting society!

Wait until you're 18 and transition! You will feel so much better, and don't listen to people that tell you otherwise. You are valid and you matter, please don't kill yourself
Thank you so much!!! <3 I hope you will get trans friends soon!!
Thank you so much!! I hope you will get trans friends in the future! <3
Thank you so much!! <3 Your comment made me smile!
Ok
This your way to get attention? You're kinda boring with your comments ngl do better. 😂

Sounds like you're fighting for something yourself. Is that why you closet and act powerful? lol.

I see it as commenting how much you love meat in a vegan territory. You'll be very right in your own 'logic' exactly, but honestly, is it worth going here?

Enjoy your time. You have your sides and so do the people here. Whatever you consider as 'normal' i'd say make an entire post about it, that'll get what you want."	sa1ji7	trans	127	0.98	2022-01-22 12:31:50
today i had family dinner	i enjoy spending time with my family, however my dead name and wrong pronouns are drilling into my head and it sucks, i feel sad	"Sorry about that
ah yeah it's always a pleasure... i pass since 2 years as woman and if i go to a family reunion (birthday, marriage, whatever) where i meet new people where i could have the chace of being seen my them as a (non trans) woman, always my Alzheimer grandpa walks by and involuntary outs me by aggressively yelling my old name and pronouns... always makes me almost cry.
hi jacob!
I feel you a lot
Start calling your family by random animal names. Sorry that you are feeling sad :(
yeah:(
Sorry
hey✌️🏻
Hope you feel better soon
i am sorry for everyone that has to undergo things like that. it's just a huge shit that fucks our lives just because we were born trans... while cis people have it for granted that everyone calls them in the right way. it's so unfair
thank you❤"	uakdqs	trans	132	0.99	2022-04-24 02:05:58
I'm sad and disappointed	"I don't even know why I'm writing this, because I don't feel like anyone would actually care... 
It's... I guess, envy? Seeing people who Live successfully transitioned and without fear makes me depressed. After almost 7 months of HRT I barely changed on appearance, my voice sounds like crap even when I try my best, and I might run out of HRT because our dumb government decided to make war to Ukraine and pills aren't getting imported anymore. 
Moreover, russia sucks, badly. I'm scared to exist, when people cheer at gays getting beaten for kissing in privacy. And I can't get out of this place, because of income and world being hostile because of war... existing is pain and disappointment.
I wonder how living feels like, but I don't think I ever will experience that. Just like my childhood..."	"Sorry with what your going through. I think everyone who transitions has to deal with fear, weather it is internalized fear on themselves or people are being Transphobic to them or both, I think we all have to deal fear. So you are not alone. Hope you feel better soon
That sounds rough, sorry hun.
Month 7 was really rough for me. I'm at 2.5 years and am doing much much better now. The time it takes isn't really linear if that makes sense.
I’m so sorry honey! Not everyone has the same results with transitioning. I don’t think anyone sees me as anything other than a guy in women’s clothing. I wasn’t able to properly modulate my voice, so I opted for Vocal Feminization Surgery, which was not successful. My voice is hoarse and barely louder than a whisper. Still it prevents me from doing my Strong Bad impersonation. 

All I can say is to hang in there. Look for the victories, no matter how small. Hope things will improve and work on improving those things under your control. Know that you are awesome just the way you are!
Can I give you a virtual hug? I'm going to make two thoughts:

&#x200B;

1. If your current method of HRT isn't working, if it weren't for the circumstances, I'd consider checking your hormone levels and upping your dose/switching your method. Its not unlikely your T levels are too high. This is the biggest reason I see people this late in transition struggling to see changes. Do not give up hope. Also, so much is yet to come after 7 months, you will get there my girl.
2. F\*\*\* Puting to Hell. I hope he dies and Satan is so disgusted that he kicks him out because Hell is too good for him. I'm really sorry that your leader is a genocidal dictator and has not only killed thousands and displaced millions of innocent Ukranians but also made life harder for the citizens of his own country. You and the rest of the people of Russia don't deserve the sanctions but sadly they are the only way to force the the Russian government to cave and hopefully give up this pointless war. And hopefully they one day cave hard so Russia can be the free country it deserves to be and one day you can either leave or you can safely transition in your home. Stay strong like you've been up to this point, things will get worse before they get better, but get better they will.
I’m so sorry to hear you’re hurting. You are cared about, the trans community loves you and you are real, even if you’re struggling to transition the way you deserve right now. I’m sorry the world is so messed up. I hope you are safe and warm.
If you beed someone to talk to, I'm here
I hope someday you are able to leave Russia and live in a country where you are free. You deserve to be happy and free and YOUR TRUE SELF.
on a physical level, i had been told by people not to expect bigger changes to even *start* until around nine months in. it took for me around a full year to see any results i wanted, and from there i’ve been steadily getting to where i want to be. same sort of timeline with voice training. while a handful of folks excel enough in presentation to nail passing like a few months in, the body needs time. be patient with it, it’ll get there ❤️

on a practical level i would strongly consider leaving as soon as possible. things are only looking to get worse for russia as this goes on, and the narrowing methods of flight available now are not guaranteed to remain viable. it’s obviously not my call to make, but it’s an option i hope you weigh heavily. please stay safe, buddy ❤️
In my case it's not only about time, but also about my environment... Long story short, my existence may become a crime, LGBTQ+ is hated around me, this country is making war so a lot of places closed their doors on russians, and also due to war my economical state is declining. If it wasn't for environmental problems, I would be in so much better condition... 

Soon it will be a question, if I want to eat enough, or take HRT. If these pills even be still available...
Then I'm praying you never have to make that painful decision. And I'm hoping you can be delivered from this to at least a little more stability.
I hope so too... 

Better leave everything behind, than losing myself here... Even family won't stop me."	uipr6f	trans	132	0.98	2022-05-05 04:56:29

Update to the 40th Birthday thread.	"Well this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/tsz73g/older_sister_wants_me_to_boy_mode_at_her_big_40th

 blew up today. I just finished the call with my sister.

Following everyone's advice I decided to lean heavily on the not going side of thing.

My sister opened almost in tears explaining that she felt terrible and didn't know how to solve this situation. Didn't want me to boymode but didn't know how to deal with the situation, and didn't want anyone coming at me because, she's my sister and she'll be protective.

We decided that best thing would be for me to come down the next weekend and have a introduction to everyone in a less party manner and more of a house by house sort of thing.

I'll be sad to miss out on the party but having it go slow and meeting everyone on my own/their own terms seems good.


Thank you all again for giving me the strength not to just self sacrafice and to stand up for myself.

Even though my sister just totally ruined my internal monologue starting with an apology.

I love this community so much. Thank you again!"	"Glad things worked out! Sorry to hear you won't be able to tp the party but I'm glad you two were able to come to a solution. It sounds like she cares a lot about you
Thanks for the well wishes. It's sad I won't be at the party, and I'll miss it. 

But we'll celebrate the next week, and it'll be much more fun."	ttfjue	trans	120	0.98	2022-04-01 01:59:16
"My partner says she is mourning ""boy-me"""	"I'm kinda conflicted on how to feel about this. My gf (cis) and I have been together for going on three years now. A little over a year ago my egg cracked and I told her not long after. She's been more than supportive and everything I could ask for and I really can't overemphasize how helpful she's been. 

Earlier today she told me that she was going through some old photos and started to get sad. She says she sometimes misses the old me and wants a chance to mourn him. It's just so strange having someone mourn you while you're still there in front of them. I'm still the same person and in all honesty ""he"" never existed. He was just a mask I put on for others and to stay safe.

I don't resent her or blame her for missing him. It just makes me feel uneasy"	"One of the hardest things in life is managing expectations. People in relationships build mental pictures of what that relationship looks like. They tell themselves stories about how it'll go, what'll happen. Even if he was a mask, she couldn't have known that until you told her, and in the meantime she's probably built up a fair bit of internal narrative around how her and his future looked together. Now it looks different. Not bad. Just different. And that takes some processing. Grieving is one way that process can manifest.
Transitioning is weird for everyone involved. You, your family, you lovers. It’s a constant fight and an exhausting one. I think you should say, if you haven’t already, that that “guy” never existed. Besides. Sure, you’ll change. But for the better. You’ll be happier, more yourself.
You said it. He was just a mask, for you, but for others it was a real person. Since you put away your mask, you’re a different person. She has precious memories of someone you once were, not who you are now. Give her some space to relive the memories and move on.
Y’know, my egg cracked a few months ago. Started HRT soon after. I spent all of my time obsessing on my transition. Worried something might go wrong, worried about my kids, my job, my future, my health, my everything. 

The second week of my transition I noticed I might have boobs. By week three they were undeniable. Week four women were noticing them at the shops. 

I realized two things after starting HRT. The first was that my days of man-mode were dwindling fast. The second thing I realized is that I had never given any thought to the end of my male life. I so desperately want to be a woman, but that doesn’t mean I hates everything about being a man. I needed to spend some time saying goodbye to that. I needed to mourn it. I will never again have the male benefits life has to offer. I kind of just overlooked that loss when I started sprinting towards the finish line. 

So I think your gf is okay to mourn the loss of her bf. That doesn’t mean she hates what he’s becoming. It just means she’s seeing the bigger picture that you don’t atm. And that’s okay. Y’know?
It might help to have a funeral/wake for the IDENTITY (not the person) to give you both closure as you burn or bury things associate with [deadname].

Only you can say if this is right for you - some would find it upsetting/depersonalising, while others may find it freeing.
My wife went through that for a month or two... about the time I went full time me... I think it's normal, it's a big adjustment. I always tell people that the partner (if there is a partner already) in transitioning too... maybe not the same, or to the same extent... but there is a bit for them to process as well.

As long as it doesn't drag out for 6 months or more... it should be okay.
It's healthy. Let her cope and come to accept the change in the way that works for her. When my wife and I had a kid, she had to mourn her old self due to transitioning from an independent person to a mom with no time for her hobbies (which were a strong part of her identity). It may seem odd, but it helped.
It's hard to explain but I get how they feel - it's like, they still love you but they also miss before all of this, so they miss, the features, I suppose of the person they fell in love with - like the way your face or hair was, stuff like that before HRT - I've been through a similar thing, it's not that they don't love you, it's that it's a big change. It's like seeing your baby pictures in a way
This feeling is probably related to what parents feel when their kids are growing up, at least I do:
Having kids, you get to know a different little child each year, and lose them just as fast, and even though they are the same persons, the one they were just a few months ago will never return. It's a strange sense of loss.
Since this is reddit I’m obligated to tell you to break up with her. Sorry friend.
I never understood the mourning thing until my ex-boyfriend started questioning his gender. Nothing ever came of it, it was rooted in toxic masculinity and men not being allowed to be feminine and whatnot. But it scared me. I supported him. But I was afraid. And I hated myself for it. Because if it was the other way around, that would hurt me like hell. But all I knew was this man that I loved, I didn't know any other version of him or who he would become. We are the same person before and after transition, but we also really aren't. We change a lot, or grow I think is the better word. It's for the better, but it's still different, and it's not a slow thing. It's sudden, it's quick. It's a lot. When you had a whole future planned out with someone that isn't really who you thought they were, even though that isn't a bad thing, it's a lot. It's change. And change isn't all bad, but it can be scary. It's new and unknown. Change can be sad. Even when it's for the better. I think saying goodbye is always a little sad. Even when saying goodbye means saying hello to something better.

[Reminds me of the death tarot card](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list/death-meaning-major-arcana-tarot-card-meanings)
Its cLled ambiguous loss
Problem is they knew you and fell in love with the person you presented, doesn't matter if that person was real to you, that's how you presented to them and that's who they grew to know and love. 

I dislike when people say ""I'm still the same person"", because of that was the case then (transition or not) you would be the same person so then why transition? The fact of the matter is you are turning into someone that wasn't presented to them in the beginning and they are now having to make life and emotional changes to keep up with your changes and new life. I would help her mourn and be supportive in any way she needs.
That's true. It's just strange and sorta unsettling how much others mourn a person I hated so much
I've been thinking a lot about it. I think I'm going too fast and perhaps I should transition in a more slowly way in order to avoid that shock.

But maybe it will happen nonetheless. My wife will probably be supportive, but her family is extremely conservative and will not accept that easily, if at all.

I've been kinda mourning my male self since I realized I'm trans and it will keep happening for a while.
XD so true
That sounds like a great plan."	ubd8sy	trans	117	0.96	2022-04-25 05:01:08
I came out to my mom!	"It was actually really rough, I had came out to her once before and she kinda just dismissed it. Today I came out to her again. There was some arguing, fear, confusion, and such. But by the end of our talk, she told me she is okay with it, that she will always love me. I still felt pretty sad because of how it went overall, but she just got back from the store (she had to return some items from walmart) and she got me a package of the pride oreos and a new shirt. 

My mom and I are really close, she is my best friend and I love her more than anything in this world. I wanted her to be apart of my journey, it is important for me to have her by my side in all of this, so for her to bring me home a gift, really made me happy and feel at peace. I am one step closer to being who I want to be."	"proud of you!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Sounds like you have a good mom. It make take her some time to fully come around to fully accepting it but it sounds like she isn’t putting her fear over her love for you which is a good sign :) congratulations and enjoy your gay Oreos!
That’s awesome. Those Oreos taste like love I’m sure. The first thing my mom bought with her Disney employee discount was a rainbow set of mouse ears and mailed them to me on my birthday last year and this reminded me of that and so I wanted to share.
so so proud of you what a huge accomplishment!! 💞💞
I am soo proud of you, (hugs), your mom sounds loving.
Thats great and way to go!! but just remember that your mom is going to go through a period of mourning over the child she though she had and is now gone. It will take time but it sounds like she has a good heart! All the best ❤️
Congrats
Also
WHAT OREOS?!?!? DM A PIC TO ME PLS NOW I’M CURIOUS
proud of you
That's awesome! That's a huge step.
Well done you! Coming out is the hardest thing to do and I'm so glad she accepted you and most of all, where are my pride oreos?
Wow, good for you! Wish I was as Luckey to get supportive parents. 😁
Im so proud of you, coming out is definitely one of the hardest things to do like every and you got through it. Congrats!
Thank you, it was really hard. I cried a ton but it is worth it!
I agree, it was a shock to her. It kind of freaked her out but I explained to her that it will take time to get use too and that I am willing to do all that I can to help her understand. Thank you!
>:)

:)
That's the big one. This is a huge news drop, so being patient and giving time to adjust is really important. Glad she seems to be supportive!
That is very sweet of your mom! They really did, she also bought me a cool shirt that I was looking at the other day, I put it on as soon as I got it. It made me feel pretty loved ☺️
Thank you so much 💗
Thank you ☺️ she is a good mom
I totally forgot to last night! I'll send you a pic in a bit!
Thank you!!
Thank you so much!
I will totally share them lol, but also thank you!
Thank you, I still have to talk to my dad. I'm not sure that one will go as well. I am proud of you though
Thank you so much ☺️
For sure! It defintelly is a big news drop, I know it will take time, thank you!
pls do lol
People can take some time to process stuff, I don't really have any advice since I only just came out less than a month ago
Oh for sure, I was sure to tell her that. It is going to be a process but I am glad she is going to be by my side during all of it
I'm glad you have the support you need, I'm also out less than a month.
I am proud of you for coming out too!
I have an appointment next week to do like bloodwork and stuff to start HRT. :)

its so frustrating	"my name is Rafaela and I'm a trans girl who lives in Brazil.
hi hello, so unfortunately, I have transphobic parents who don't care if I'm happy with myself or not.  I live with very strong dysphoria for years and I've reached my limit several times.  I don't know what else to do.  I feel sad and alone, and all my relationships have been on the internet.  I've never had a love connection with anyone in person and I think the reason is that I'm trans.

I've been through a lot of hardships in my life, and I'm tired.

I just wanted to wear a skirt or a nice dress in public, without the risk of being beaten.  I wanted to wear extravagant makeup without anyone using bigoted swearing against me.  I wish I had a group of friends who understand me.

I just wanted to live feeling happy and comfortable with myself.

I'm 15 years old.

sorry for my bad english."	"It is very frustrating that not only you've been born in wrong body you also been born in terrible country. Life sucks for everyone, but you got it extra difficult. It will be hard but it will get better.  


The best what you can do now is to move out, that should be your priority. You can't live your life there. Save up or seek opportunity. You already lost your parents, there is nothing to hold you there, you only live once. Some good developed countries even have LGBT refugee programs, maybe you could make a use of them.
Oi rafaela, sou do Brasil, n sei se posso te ajudar, mas pode me chamar no privado se precisar de uma amiga.

I feel sorry for you, imagine the only thing you have to do is comment and hate on people in a sub because there’s unconsciously a part of yourself that you hate so much you feel compelled by a force you don’t even understand to project it everywhere and spread the poison you’ve got seated deep inside you. Please try to love yourself more, and forgive yourself for all the hate you’ve let fester inside - you deserve love - despite what you think."	u3jdln	trans	120	0.97	2022-04-14 14:55:19
I feel so alone.	"I feel like I’m a very forgettable person. Keeping friendships and relationships is hard for me. 

My dating pool was already small, I feel like it’s nonexistent now. I’ve had online long distant relationships but I haven’t had anything real. I had a relationship that lasted 1 year IRL back in high school. After that, the realest relationship I’ve had was a long distant one where we flew to see each other a couple times 3 years ago. 

I had an online friend who moved near the area I was living in about a year ago. We became best friends and she helped me through so many things. We cried in each other’s arms many times and were there for each other during some of our worst times. 

I fell for this girl. Hard. 

We had previously been flirty and even had a sort of FWB thing going on for a little while. After that slowed down months after I confessed to her that I really liked her. She got kinda flirty and started getting kind of suggestive. I was really hesitant at first because I didn’t want to be just FWB anymore but ultimately caved in. 

I had asked her if she’d go on a date with me and she accepted. I planned a whole day out and we both had a really great time. It was one of the best nights of my life. She seemed to be really happy as well… so I asked if we could date/ if she’d be my girlfriend. She said no. I smiled and told her she was my best friend anyway and that I love her regardless, which is 100% true… but I pretended like it wasn’t a big deal. 

I feel like it broke me. Normally I would have brushed something like this off.. but I think I snapped. I’ve had so many people in my life abandon me. My mother abandoned me for drugs and an abusive partner, my dad was there for me my whole life until I came out… then his view towards me changed almost instantly. Most of my friends I’ve ever known have come and gone and I don’t think I’ve ever felt fully safe emotionally around anyone but her. She hugged me tighter than anyone has, she supported me through things that others wouldn’t. I felt safe. 

I’m starting to feel like I will never find someone who understands me. I’ll never find anyone who will love me the same way that I would love them. 

I just want one person. One. Fucking. Person. To be as happy to be around me as I am them. I just want one person to care about me on more than just a surface level. There are 8 billion people in this sad fucking world and I can’t seem to find **one**."	"I’m so sorry, honey. :(

It may feel really shitty right now, but it doesn’t last forever. 

Honestly, you sound like a really sweet, open, and beautiful person. You will eventually cross paths with someone that falls head over heels for your amazingly beautiful qualities. Someone that you really click with. 

My advice is to spend time embracing these feelings. Think then out. Accept them. That’s worked well for me in the past.
I am sorry to hear that 🙁
The only way I know how to make friends is to go out and do group activities. Take an art class, fitness groups ect… Just find someone you vibe with and start inviting them out to stuff until they become your friend.
I’m so sorry that you feel this way, I know that feeling and yeah it’s like one of the worse feelings ever. But hey all that you could do is keep your head up and stay strong, which yeah I’m sure it sounds easier said done which it is but you gotta try. My dm’s are always open too if you’ll like someone to talk to, I’m all ears! (Or eyes too technically). But stay strong tho that one one will show up in your life eventually
I don’t know if it will make you feel better, but while your dating pool is smaller, the people who do take interest in you will be more interested. You’re also being you. Between those two things, I’d say your dating life will be easier in the long run. 

We’re all here for you! I feel for you and support you 100%. 

It also sounds like you still have your friend. There’s 7 or 8 dimensions of attraction and connection, and it’s equally as important that she fills some of those other ones if it’s not meant to be romantic. I’d even bet that she IS just as happy around you as you are with around her. 

The work you put into yourself, your growth, your comfort in your own skin paired with effort will get you results. Keep going, girl. You got this. 💖
What i can say i spent my life with very few friends,and i understand what loneliness mean its fucking awful,with the same questions in my head ,what the hell wrong with the world? I think we can understand each others very well i would like to chat too! If you want of course!
Why ? You are so Beautiful and freaking cute you shouldn't feel like that i would love to have a girlfriend like you !! Just stay positive you are very cute 💐💐💐
I hope so :( I’ve felt depressed because of this for a while.

What exactly do you mean by “embracing the feeling”?
I also really appreciate your compliments towards me. Thank you
I’ve done this in the past. I got really into rock wall climbing for a little and nobody really ever approached me. And any people I ever talked to it was like a one off thing sadly
Honestly I did this for the longest time. I focused on myself, I learned to love myself… but then everything came crashing down on me all at once. And not having anyone close to me doesn’t really help my mental health. I feel like the longer I go the sadder I get. 

I however just started a new job so I’m hoping it keeps my head busy long enough to not think about it as much
IDK. Hard to explain. I just sort of stop fighting it, and let it flow freely. Sometimes that’s enough to get it out of my system.

I'm sad about that ... she doesn't understand. I can't stop thinking about it. it bothers me that I'm a girl to everyone.	"That's just your mom being closed minded,  just do what makes you happy,  and hopefully she will accept it and support you during this time of change.. YOU deserve to be happy too..
Sir, I do believe you are in fact not an girl.
I'm sorry your mother reacted that way.  You don't deserve to be brushed off like that.
Time to get the emotion bottle! I require help also a sledgehammer to break that bottle-
Parents can be ridiculous, all that matters is that you’re happy with who you are so dont listen to her
Why don’t you try writing her a letter, or sending a tong test message about how you feel when people call you something that you’re not, and trying to describe your feelings with dysphoria and how when she invalidates them if only makes them worse, then maybe send her some articles on being trans that are positive, there’s this great one called “the gender dysphoria Bible” that I’d recommend as it’s clean does things in a professional way. Tell her how you want to transition, it sounds like you’re young so maybe ask your doctor about hormone blockers, trying out a new nickname and pronouns, haircut and getting clothes that make you comfortable and confident"	siw1qu	trans	111	0.98	2022-02-02 18:32:43

Feels so good to finally be out and be myself I haven’t been able to sleep. Was a little sad killing my old accounts but wow was it so worth it to feel so liberated		"Congratulations
Congratulations on coming out!! It's such a huge step, and a relief. I'm happy for you to live the rest of your life as the person you truly want to be.
Congrats! Looking fabulous ❤️🙂
omg i absolutely LOVE your makeup, i could never pull of black as a lipstick and eyeshadow. but it totally fits your bonestructure and over all softness, and your eyebrows don't even get me started. They not only fit you but they're just the right shape for your eyes and forehead. and that hair oh lawd, the softness, the colour, the subbtle curls at the end. i couldn't be more jealous than i already am

tldr: you're about as beautiful as aphrodite herself, not entirely (cuz you'know shes a goddess and very jealous) but you're damn close
Lovely 💜
Thank you!
Thank you. I’ve been feeling fabulous as well!
Wow I think this is the nice thing anyone’s ever said to me. It was my first time trying black and I was Terrified to mess it up. I really like it though and it’s kind of gotten me curious about different gothy looks. Thank you 💜 💜
Thank you 💜

It’s sad that trans kids that need this kind of medical treatment can’t get access to it until they are 18 and puberty is already said and done. What I would do to reverse time and start early as a trans girl….		"Its insane, Puberty blockers have very mild side effects and huge benefits for those who want to take them. The long term impacts can mostly be mitigated. The politicians who oppose gender identity support do not believe trans folks deserve to live. They are well aware of what happens to so many trans youth who are unable to get care.
Pretty sure this will be challenged. It's a medical board going against the medical consensus, is very discriminatory as it targets people based on sex/gender, and will cause more harm than good.
I fully expect that this will be challenged in federal court.
Why can't people just leave our rights alone?! They don't affect you they affect the people whose rights you are taking away, just leave us alone. It's so fucking sick to force people to go through the wrong puberty, and it's absolutely horrible to force us to wait 18 years until we can be ourselves. Trans care saves lives, taking it away indirectly destroys the lives of many people. Ugh, why are people so horrible.
People who make these kinds of decisions always seem to be under the guise of “caring for the youth” and protecting them from making a choice they can’t back away from. 

Now imagine if they used that money and energy to protect kids and teens from other things that really hurt them like suicides, motor vehicle accidents, drug abuse and safety. 

If a minor feels they are trans it really is something for them and their parents to go through, it’s not like it’s some contagious disease like measles they need protection from. 

I feel like anti trans people always say “what about the kids who regret transitioning!?” but also seem to ignore the plethora of ones whose transition saved them.
Legit I don't think I'd even transition if I could do this as a kid, I'd just stay on blockers for my life if I could. I don't want estrogen or testosterone in my body at all.
I haven't read the draft, but are puberty blockers for sure included?  Probably, knowing the state but I can see how puberty blockers could be omitted from the definition of gender ""affirming"" care
Exactly what I'm thinking. Blockers, hormones, and top surgeries are all used to treat non-trans related issues in kids too. Especially since gender dysphoria is a legitimate diagnosis, this is essentially discriminating based on gender and/or condition. Absolutely needs to be challenged.

Also obligatory not that anyone's cutting off trans kid's genitals to begin with, but if you wanna get angry at bottom surgery get angry at male circumcision and intersex surgeries that's still happening in the U.S. to this day.
I also did not read this one, but puberty blockers have been part of the previous legislations I have seen and ONLY apply to trans youth, not non trans kids with early onset puberty.."	yme1pn	trans	109	0.95	2022-11-04 23:37:39

In the Transphobes mindset any instance of Anxiety, Depression, lack of fulfilled need, could not possibly have a connection with Transness...because in the Transphobes view, Transness presents a challenge to some Zero-Sum Value(Whether it is distorted from a Non-Zero Sum Value or not.).~Sylar

""Hey, the laws that we make deliberately target lgbtqa+ people.""

🏳️‍⚧️: “Hey we’re depressed as fuck and life is terrible because of this ”
Dis Bitch: “Oh no, how can I help? Please vote for me 🥺”
actually, it's a really hard question indeed. I am a trans girl, but sometimes i wonder if i'm depressed because i am trans or i am trans because i am depressed. You see, maybe we aren't born pre configured and we start to be male or female because our culture was selected by nature this way. If i am not mistake, there is a branch in science who applies Darwin to human behavior. Like: why in all culture women generally stayed home and the male went to hunt. It could be because the males are stronger and it would be better to the community that women stayed home and have more babies.   
But don't get me wrong, I am not telling that our cause is not a valid one. I am just saying that maybe, we are trans because we want to bealive it would bring us happiness. And for most people, it does brings happiness, because it's the chance the person has to reshape their life.   
Society today asks too much of us. We have to me the best at everything we do. But if you choose to rebel, to became trans. You're kinda breaking away from the chain of society. You start to feel happier.

For some reason, I *really* want to wear a sundress.	"For the past week I have had a burning desire to wear a sundress. It's been making me sad because that's basically impossible right now. My parents are not supportive at all, in fact, they seem to have forgotten about me coming out at all. I think I would look cute in a sundress.

I'm a minor, plus I live in Arkansas, so there isn't really anything I can do except wait until I'm an adult. I hope things will go well for me in the future."	"Hi! You could look up local lgbt organizations in arkansas. Contact them and let them know your situation. They'll hopefully advice you and you'll at the very least, have that little bit of support.

Also, I'm sorry you won't be able to wear a sundress. I hope somewhere in the future you'll be thinking back to this moment while wearing one.
Don't give up! You will be in a sundress one of these days!
I wish you the best for the future
Accumulated dresses for 20 years that I could never wear anywhere now when I go out I never have to wear the same thing twice
Money's power hun focus on your future and getting a job and you can wear a bacon swimsuit in Malibu if you want. Also fashion Design is a career and I'd pay well you for a functional bacon swimsuit for my wife. She's weirdly shaped.
U could order one online and send it to a friends house?
Op Forget them you buy that sundress and you wear it like a Boss! I would love to see it! If you need support I'm happy to talk!
I take this back but it's too funny to delete. I'm letting it stand
To be honest, I don't have any friends outside of the internet. Plus I live in the middle of nowhere. Ordering one would be a huge mistake.
Ahh I see I'm sorry then I wish u the best for the future once u move out u can buy all the sundresses u want /pos
Maybe theres an amazon pickup point near you? You could order it to there then pick it up and hide it without having it be delivered to you house"	t73alx	trans	101	0.98	2022-03-05 06:24:01
Hey im came out to my parents as trans and they disowned me and said “Don’t expect a place in this house ever again liberal Garbage” and went on to call me a fag and stuff like that she I be sad for letting me family down?		"Your family should be ashamed of letting you down.
Homophobic and transphobic slurs on top of that?
Sorry that happened to you. Get away as fast as you can.
Don't feel bad, gender dysphoria is not something you choose, you should put yourself first and your family second. The main thing is you did what's best for you. They should feel ashamed for letting you down and not taking time to reflect and educate themselves on what your going through. I hope your safe and doing okay.
Hang in there! It will get better, I promise. My kid is trans. Same kid, same heart, different gender. You look adorable, btw.
I’m so sorry that happened to you. I hope you have a friend or relative who accepts you and can get you away from your parents. Be extremely careful about your parents and depending on where you live conversion therapy and conversion camps are illegal. I hope I can be as strong as you one day and come out to my mom and step dad.
Hopefully I don’t Get sent to some church thing
Don’t feel bad for being urself. I’m proud of you c:
They’re terrible people, you’re just being yourself and they refuse to accept you. You have no obligation to suffer because of them, try not to feel bad about it. Living your life free IS A RIGHT. Not a privilege. ❤️ wishing you the best of luck.
No don't be sad be emboldened to find the drive to rise above it and get to the top to give the finger to anyone who put you down best wishes trans sister.
They called you a liberal?
What family? They may have birthed you but that's not family, therefore you couldn't have let your family down.

I'm also MtF and more or less had the same thing happen, I'm with you girl.
NO; good riddance. While we’d all love to get along and have supportive family, sometimes you just gotta let go. I’m sure you’ve tried your darndest to make it work over the time you knew you were different. They made their decision, and now you build up yourself. You let me know if you ever need anything, girly. We’re all here for you!
You didn't let your family down, they let you down
I'm so sorry they called you a liberal comrade
Dont be sad, enjoy being your true self. Find the joy of being happy as you are meant to be. Your parents may be narrow minded but you will find true friends that believe in you. Maybe someday your parents will understand that they lost the chance to share your joy as you grow into your true and best self. I wish you the best and happiest future you can find.
1. You did not let them down. They're just (excuse me) homophobic assholes.

2. Fuck no! You should not be sad. They should be sad for letting an amazing person like you leave their life because you just like being a girl.

And 3. Fuck them, you're amazing, and don't apologize (EVER) for being yourself.
No, you should be proud to not be a piece of shit. And though I don't condone violence, if you slammed their fingers in the door that would be ok in my book.
1 Timothy 5:8 - But if anyone does not provide for his own, especially those in his own house, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. ... spew that at your parents
Sorry to hear that, as a parent myself I am proud of you for being strong and being youself!
The only reason you should be sad for them is that they don't get to see your transition and never met the real you

Im ugly lol
Conservatives are weird lol

Nope, you aren’t. Don’t say that about your beautiful self, please.
I will counter that by saying this. In old Hebrew they had 6 words for gender identity - Male, female, trans male, trans female, neither (more based on genitalia from the sounds of it than non-binary) and both (intersex basically). 

So one could read that Deuteronomy passage as if you’re a man (cis or trans) don’t go running around wearing dresses, if you are a woman (cis or trans) don’t go running around wearing pants or whatever men wore typically before pants were a thing)."	mav31l	trans	100	0.99	2021-03-22 18:56:48
I wore fem clothes for the first time and I feel very bad	Today I went out with a friend, we had a great time and at the end she gave me her old clothes. I hid them in my bedroom until it was late at night so that I could try them. The clothes are so cute! She gave me some dresses and even a spinny skirt! But when I tried them I just felt the biggest dysphoria ever. I've never noticed how muscular I am, how weird my legs look, how flat my chest is. I feel like wearing them again, just to see, but I know I'll look bad; even so, I'm kinda questioning myself again, I'm not feeling sad, I just feel nothing, empty. Maybe the clothes are not very well suited for me, maybe something else could look cuter in me, I really don't know, I just feel like giving up.	"From my experience as an Amab trans woman I felt something very similar. After a lot of introspection I realized a majority of it was engraned social norms and a great fear of going against them. A feeling of 'I'm not supposed to enjoy this' but after time and lots of encouragement I was able to make progress towards how I wanted to feel and not how I was ""supposed"" to feel. Also there's a chance that those clothes aren't your style. Afab women have decades to work out what they like and what works, trans women come late to that but it's still very important to have that stage and explore different clothing.
Different styles fit different people. When i first tried on fem clothes, they did work for me at all. Keep experimenting with different styles, and eventually you will find something that makes you happy in it.
Its normal. For one putting clothes can make the contrast btwn what we wanna see vs what we see a lot stronger.
Fem clothes cause euphoria for some transfems and depression for others. The causes of making people feel bad is they highlight parts of your body that need to change (causing dysphoria), make you feel bad because you dont fit into social attractiveness norms, and internalized transphobia. Stick with your HRT and be patient!
Trying on feminine clothes for me didn’t work, I was like “nope this is not it.” (Well jeans worked). But I noticed that wearing more fitted masculine clothes worked really well for me and achieves the look I want and they are more fitted as I was born male.
If I put on some fem clothes, I feel great until I look in the mirror. It’s an unfortunate part of the whole thing. As others have said, it takes a while to find what looks good on you.
I found at first that wearing skirts with my old boy shirts worked very well, then I went shopping for dresses that fit me better. It took some time, but it was definitely worth it. Just have some patience and take things slowly.
A similar story of mine is when my friend did my nails for me (fake acrylic nails), I always thought I had to like it cause it's feminine but I absolutely hated it. I love my regular nails painted tho. For me it was an absolutely crucial experience, because it's reassuring that I'm doing it because of how I feel and not what I think I have to look like. (Hope you understand what I mean)
For me although I'm into the cute stuff, I wear more oversized blouse and leggings as those feels nice and doesn't trigger me as much. There's so much I wanna try xD but I don't think I have the confidence to face my dysphoria like that.
Very relatable, have had also trouble finding clothes that actually feel and look good on me. This even probably kept me in closet to myself for many years because some experiments with women's clothes always left me feeling ugly about myself.

But if you have the energy to keep experimenting it is definitely possible to find something that works. Also, loose fit doesnt equal masculine! i've found comfort in feminine clothes that are bit over-sized.

Also, for me at least, it is not only about the looks – wearing tights under jeans for example often has felt pretty good.
When I was first trying to figure out how to present myself I was a total mess.Theres a gazillion different styles sizes fits so daunting.I started going to  thrift stores like goodwill,Savers ect So many styles represented and sizes you can try stuff on and it's a fraction of the cost of retail.Everyonce and a while something would click as I think I can wear this.
I cross dressed in private on and off for years, and really struggled with the “I’m just a guy in a dress” feeling. Woman’s clothing just made me feel more masc, and I even assumed for a long time that since I didn’t get positive feelings from it, I couldn’t be trans. My body shape and the person I saw in the mirror didn’t match up with what I wanted to see. 

Maybe try experimenting with other things? Wearing feminine underwear (sports bras or bralettes are great at the start!) or nail polish or subtle jewelry or experimenting with makeup or learning about other peoples trans experience and seeing how they matched up with mine was helpful. There is plenty of other stuff you can experiment with that isn’t clothing related. 

I also found it helpful to make my clothing changes more subtle — swapping the clothing I had been wearing for more feminine versions of the same thing. I wore a lot of jeans and crew-neck t-shirt’s before, so I swapped that for womens skinny jeans and v-neck tshirts and experimented with more feminine colors and patterns. You don’t have to jump to dresses and skirts immediately if that doesn’t feel good to you. Over time as I’ve gotten more comfortable and as HRT has done good things for me, I’ve experimented more, tried different cuts and styles, and now dresses and skirts feel great. 

Just cuz I wasn’t comfortable in fem clothing at first didn’t make me any less trans! I just had to figure out what worked for me.
I've had similar experiences, in boy clothes things are ""fine"", but in girl clothes I see all of the parts of my body I want to fix to make them work better, and it's tough to look past that.  But I also see it as a good thing, because it feels like the feminine wear is so much more appealing that it makes me want to improve myself rather than settling, and that I might be able to end up better than ""fine"".  Sounds a lot like how cute you feel these new clothes are to you.

Shape wear or a bra and inserts can help make clothes fit nicer, plus mute some of the things that are bugging you.  It's helped me a lot with getting over that initial hurdle, way better than when I just put some clothes on by themselves at first and thought this doesn't look right.
I know the feeling well. After a lot of thought, what I arrived on was this: sometimes I feel more dysphoric when I try to pass because I realize that I really don't pass all that well and that no one will actually see me as I want to be seen. I'm trying and failing. Whereas when I don't try to pass, I can pretend that I COULD pass if i wanted to. It's being forced to confront the reality of your body vs imagining what passing would look like
Is your friend your size? Women's clothing is made in all shapes and sizes. I'm 6'2"" it's hard to find clothes that fit right (sleeves are always too short, and shoes forget it) keep trying! 

They size all this stuff differently for women as well so it's better to go off numbers rather than sizes like L or XL.

If you have not already measure yourself waist, inseam, hip, high hip, bust, arm length, front waist length, back waist length. There is very subtle silence to find clothes that fit right in particular women's clothing.

Find your style everybody's different, try hard enough you'll find something that looks good on you.

Also most of the stuff I wear now looked super odd on me before I started HRT.
This >>>

It's true, I do still struggle with internalized transphobia, I kinda felt like I should not enjoy it. Even so, my body didn't look right, but I felt very cute anyways. Maybe I can find something that works better on me.
Yes, I see what you mean. Her clothes are very bright and fem, in my head I always wanted to use male white T-shirts with a black legging shorts (like, every day as if I was a cartoon). I do have the T-shirts and she did gave me shorts that looked like what I wanted, but the T-shirts turned out to be too big (I like'em baggy >:)). So I may experiment more, I do feel like trying them again, because even tho I didn't like how my body look, I loved how it felt. Maybe I'll find something that fits me.
Totally, I've always liked baggy T-shirts and stuff. Maybe her cute ass clothes were not for me nor my body type. It's never about what PEOPLE think will look good, it's all about US. I just need to find my own style!
Would be so great to find store that actually has feminine clothes that fit my body bit better lol

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Maybe your right, I should try beeing feminine in other ways, but I was really hopping that the clothes would do it for me. Maybe something else, maybe after a few years into HRT (Im pre-everything btw) my body would fit better into women clothing.

My uncles girlfriend send me this after I told her i think i'm trans.	"We have a really close family with my moms side, we were having a christmas party and i was kinda high and a little drunk so i told my uncles girlfriend as shes really sweet and she send me this (I'm AMAB, most likely trans):

**""Hey Noah, just wanted to say if you want to talk about it again, you're always welcome! Because now Egon (my uncle) came in so I couldn't say anything. I will not say anything to him (or the rest) but know that no one in the family would look at you differently, we like you for who you are. But it is good that you can talk to some people about it. Do your mum and mila (sister) know? Yes, I guess. They will support you no matter what, and me too. Sleep well, it was a nice party as always🎄.""**

I thought this was the sweetest text I ever got from someone, we don't have a really close bond because i don't see them that much (once every couple of months) and they're not LGBTQ to my knowledge so this gave me a little euphoria and made me grateful for the people I have around me!

I'm pretty sure my best friend is transphobic - UPDATE - He is :( (tw: transphobia, obviously)	"This is an update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/t1dxpb/im_pretty_sure_my_best_friend_is_transphobic/) post.

Today, I found out, that sadly, he is actually transphobic. I have a group chat with him and some of my other friends, and he posted a transphobic meme (next part has a spoiler on it as it says the transphobic meme) >!saying ""bro s-stop... I'm a boy"" then the next panel says ""I don't care, looks female enough."" !<. This really upset me, as a closeted trans girl. I didn't respond to the meme. I hope by the time I come out as trans (most likely in a few years), I won't be talking to him anymore or he'll no longer be transphobic. I really hope this is just him being an ignorant 13 year old.

Does this mean the rest of the group chat is transphobic? No. One of my friends seems to be fine with trans people and my cousin (who is in this group chat) corrected me when I accidentally misgendered my brother. The other 2 people in the group chat I'm not sure about."	"That’s awful, you guys are pretty young (which isn’t an excuse of course), but it’s possible a lot of hate is being fed to him by parents or other peers. I hope he gets better and becomes more open-minded because I can’t imagine how hard this is for you. You should bring something up with him, maybe ask about how he feels about the LGBTQ+ and from there, see if you’d feel comfortable ever telling him about your identity in the near future
I mean he's only 13. Personally I used to be transphobic myself as a kid. And it was all because of the way I was raised. But I was able to unlearn that at an early age, and he can too.

My suggestion (which you don't have to take) is to just talk to him about it. Say something like, ""hey I don't think this meme you posted was very funny, and it seems a bit transphobic. Are you transphobic or was it one of those things that you just didn't realize is hurtful to others?""

Or, rather, maybe I'm misreading it and he already told you that he's transphobic. In that case, you have two options that I suggest:
1- just leave him as a friend, altogether. He's not worth it
2- ask him something like ""what would you do if someone close to you came out as trans?"" And depending on his answer, you might just have to go back to option one and leave him completely.
You almost certainly won't have the same friends in a few years, it's part of growing up so try not to sweat it. It's also very possible that he may chill out, some people do grow into better versions of themselves. 

Sometimes they just grow older without growing any emotionally though so it's a crap shoot. Anyways sorry you had to deal with that.

If you think it's important to keep this friend you could attempt to get him to thoroughly explain to you why he says the transphobic things he does, and then remind him that he's being unkind when he says those things and if he tries to justify it ask him where he came up with that in order to get him to look at his own reasoning.

You would probably be able to reach him that way.

For example when he says something like ""Hey that person is transgender, his real name is blah"" ask him why he think's it's important to point that out. Then he hits you with the whole ""he was born blah and he's a boy"" and you can say ""she doesn't want to go by blah, why would you continue calling her blah if she wants to leave that name behind? That's kind of immature of you to do that to someone""

Like calling them out but in a kind productive conversational way. It's bound to go poorly but if I realized I was trans when I was in middle/high school I would have rolled with a completely different friend group lol.
I’m really sorry. In middle school when I came out to my ex best friend (from elementary school) she was homophobic so I get what you are going through. I would maybe try to talk to him and say something about trans people, maybe educate him?
Putting aside the transphobia there's also so sexual assault/ignoring consent stuff happening in that meme. He probably needs a talking to on what it's okay to joke about.
Damn, he's a literal kid. Honestly, just distance yourself from him. He might end up changing his mind later on. 

When I was 13, I wasn't really transphobic, but I was definitely an anti-feminist socialism hater.

Now I'm a feminist commie and a satanist so.
holy shit another transphobic comment what is going on today

anyways i have [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMiLG0lvMk) which may change your mind
cant even spell the r slur right, go back to your math hw dumbfuck
Aww what a sad person to go on the trans subreddit purely to spread hate. 

I hope you get some kind of feeling in your heart from this and telling people to kill themselves like your only other comment
ah, i see you're transphobic

i have [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMiLG0lvMk) which may change your mind
Get a load of this miserable piece of shit. Fuck off phobe.
LMAO 😭 THE VIDEO
[removed]
thank u/CreativeNameAlt for that idea
dude leave us alone

go back to your weird facebook groups and that transphobic website which i will not name
And telling people they should kill themselves doesn’t increase their suicide potential? Literally abusing them, going to their spaces to spread your hate with “your hormies” doesn’t increase their suicide potential? The fear of being abandoned by those close to them doesn’t increase their suicide potential. 

Maybe if you fucking scum would shut the fuck up and let trans people live in peace the world would be a better place. 

Opinions are like assholes. Everyone has them and no one wants to see yours

Coming out didn’t go well	"I was debating heavily on posting but I need to vent. I finally got the courage to talk to my wife and tell her I'm not happy being male and was wanting to transition. It didn't go well at all. She was not very supportive at all. 
I feel so defeated right now, upset and sad. She thinks it's just a phase and we will ""work though it"" wtf? I don't know what to do right now. This morning I hardly even said anything to her."	"It sucks, but please try to understand that she's (probably) coming from a place of hurt, confusion and wanting to preserve your relationship. She's in denial, and if you're patient with her while still standing your ground, she will most likely come around. You're both hurting, and it can be so easy to let that hurt get between you.

It sucks, and it shouldn't fall to you to have to deal with it though. I'm sorry.
I, too,am so sorry you two are going through this…I went through this 3 years ago and it was similarly heartbreaking for both of us. Neither of us were at fault… this isn’t that kind of thing.  We got divorced a very short time later, still best friends.  I didn’t think I’d ever be happy again, especially with the guilt. 

Fast forward to now, everything clicked into place this past year (*feel free to read my first ever post from earlier this year*), and I can honestly say that I’ve never been happier in my life than I am now.

I’m still pre-everything but I’m living 100% as myself now, totally free and able to go anywhere and do everything I only dreamed of doing before I came out.
Good luck, Sis! 🙋🏻‍♀️
First I want to congratulate you on taking the first step of self-care. I know you feel like shit right now but things will eventually work themselves out. What you did took guts and you should be proud of yourself.

If you want to remain in your marriage, it is vitally important to give her time to process things. Keep her involved. Be willing to share what you are thinking and forewarn her as you are taking each step in your transition.

She is going through a lot. Try not to judge her. A lot of stuff is going to come out sideways and will hurt if you let it. She will go through the 5 stages of the grieving process. Anger and negotiating are the hardest. The opinion that this is a phase is the later. 

My recommendation is to help educate her.  The book *She’s not there* helped my wife. There is the Reddit group /r/mypartneristrans is great and getting individual and couples therapy would be very beneficial.

I transitioned 20 months ago after nearly 2 years of confronting my gender. I’m still with my wife after 38 years. Love can prevail if you both work at it.
Sorry to hear this. We're all here for you. It's not the same I know but in my experience it helps
I am so sorry that you feel like this but when it comes to coming out there is alot you must consider. First of all, your wife has known you as your AGAB while you have spent a significant amount of time thinking about how you might be trans. It didn’t take you 15 minutes to accept who you so be respectful and give her time to process something that you have most likely been thinking about for a very long time. With change comes a lot of uncertainty and anxiety, so if she doesn’t understand certain things educate her but be patient as this will take time. Not everyone is exposed to the Trans community and thus most people don’t understand how to even react to learning a person they have know for so long isn’t that person truly so yeah. I bet even the super supportive parents, friends or spouses take a lot of time to process things internally. Hopefully y’all can get through this and come to an understanding and I hope it works out for the best. sorry for the ramble.
I’m so sorry to hear that… I feel like I can relate to this so much.. I really hope she comes around and decides to support you living your truth. ❤️
I'm sorry to hear that. But be strong, we don't know what the future holds.

Focus on the good things to come and keep moving.
i know this might sound very hard but if she is like that and isn't willing to change then leave her. You happiness iis more important then a marriage
I am sorry to hear that. I know how you feel in this situation. If I could give some advice.. talk to her, how you feel about being a trans. Especially, that you feel hurt after her reaction. If she won't understand.. then take a break. To think and calm down.
I'm so sorry. :( I just want you to know you are valid.
I understand your situation because  I'm going through something to
Do you have any friends that you can tell?  

What about going to a therapist? They could be supportive, and could help you go through this better.
She's scared of this and doesn't have the benefit you do of knowing how true it is on the inside.  Yet.  Don't lose faith in her before all the chips have fallen and share yourself with her unapologetically, even when it hurts you or her.  And hopefully she will do the same.  Married partners should never seek to intentionally harm one another, but should not be afraid of hurting one another along the way when the hurt is due to authenticity.  Sorry if I'm getting too pedantic or preachy.  What you're going through really sucks and I hope you don't get stuck in that.
Just to preface this, I'm not forcing you to do anything I suggest. Its your choice on what course of action to take. If she continues acting like this, I'd say divorce may be necessary. Like someone else said, she's in a state of denial and needs time to come around. Don't divorce her immediately. Try and talk to her about everything first


Being trans sucks, I dated a person as a ""girl"" for five years and when I came out to her, she also told me it was a phase and broke up with me. Best choice ever. Fast forward a few years of dating and heartbreak, I'm now in the happiest relationship I could possibly be in, with a girl who understands and cares for me.
Thank you so much!
❤️
I have reached out to 2 of my sisters, and two close friends. They are all very supportive and proud that I am coming out of my shell so to speak. It makes me happy that I have them in my life. :)
I am considering seeking out gender affirmation therapy as well.
Amazing! I'm very happy for you. We'll be glad to hear how it goes.
Yes. Any therapist that is supportive would be very positive"	rl7ciq	trans	98	0.99	2021-12-21 05:36:49
When you get misgendered, do you get really sad first and cry and then boil internally with anger or the other way around?		"I dissociate usually
At this point if I get misgendered I just laugh at whoever did it because if you look at me and earnestly go 'ah yes, a woman' then you're clearly so invested in your transphobia that it's made you stupid.
It happened today at my therapy appointment. I start to kind of dissociate, get over it fast, then think about it for the next hour LOL
I kind of just go numb on the outside and wait until I’m alone to get pissed off. I don’t want to give people the satisfaction of knowing they rustled my jimmies.
I dissociate and try to get away from the situation. I get angry later. When the anger fades I'm sad about it.
I dissociate and then feel shameful and uncomfortable  for whatever reason lollllllll
for us it's either a ""huh, who're you referring to?"", an Ugh, or Furious Rage
Usually when I get angry I start crying too so all of the above all at once I guess
If it’s on purpose then I usually get really angry and then secretly cry afterwards. If it’s an accident or they don’t know then I just try and pretend it didn’t happen, it used to really upset me and I’d try to leave or atleast stop the conversation but it’s happens alot so I’m used to it now
Little column A. Little column B. But generally just disassociate.
Anger first, sadness later.
Neither...
If it’s by family? I don’t really care anymore. 

Misgendered by strangers? That’s when I start sulking.
So, idk if this is just a problem with me or something, but I physically flinch when I get deadnamed or misgendered. Obviously I feel super sad, but I have a hard time feeling angry at strangers, or even people I know. Sometimes I will get mad at myself if I’m not feeling to well, but most of the time I just feel sad about it
I just move on because it happens everyday of my life so nothing else to do. I’m stuck in a lease and my family that lives with me, makes it feel like a prison. I’ll cry when someone actually gets it right and the correct name.
""Why did you call me that?"" \*NINJA STARE\*
Depends, depends on who's fronting. Depends on who's close to the front. If my trauma holder is close to the front there is going to be hell to be paid in full. She takes no shits from no one.

If it's one of the littles cry scream throw temper tantrum. 

But I always always, ends with me rapid switching, and having a killer migraine when it's finally finished.
I got misgendered when ordering fast food today. I tend to get a little angry and dissociate and then feel really sad about it after a few minutes
I just feel really gross until I’m alone and then either get really mad or cry
I'm an NB who only knows how to dress masc or fem so I get excited as fuck whenever someone use they/them anything else is business as usual
I feel absolutely nothing and don't even care at all. I just move on immediately.
It doesnt feel correct or normal for me
I just feel uncomfortable, if anyone misgenders me I feel like it’s only out of spite, I don’t pass much but I try hard to dress femininely and look it so it’d be hard to get it wrong, it doesn’t happen much but when it does it sucks. Feel really bad about it for a while after though.
Depends. Most of the time I dissociate and then don’t remember why/understand why I’m feeling upset hours or days later.
I used to get sad. Now i get angry. At this point anyone that misgenders me is doing it on purpose >:(
Eh, they don't get a vote, I am me. It's bothersome, but that's it.
I cry. My depression gets worse until I do an EMDR session. Then I start to feel better after a day or two. 

I mean, it sucks for my dysphoria but it’s also that I know that they’re going to do the same thing to any trans people they knowingly encounter and knowing the mindset that underlies it.
I just shudder for half a second and the rage goes away. I literally shake it off like a dog
I don’t care. Especially if the person did it by accident (this has never happened though). I don’t care because I know myself better than anyone else could. And anyone calling me “she” is legitimately only trying to get a reaction out of me. And they won’t get it. Because I simply don’t care. Sometimes I find it funny, because it feels ridiculously wrong to me if someone thinks I’m a girl.
So in short, I don’t care and when it happens it feels like a joke
i tell people i’m a cis woman with a hormone deficiency
Not misgendered but I remember my parents suggested I watched “what is a woman” and I had those emotions
I tend to just ignore it, I know I don’t pass well at all so I just push past it.
Somewhere between ""What young man you mean?""  and ""B* what"" or on special occasions ""Look at my other eyes and call me a young man again"". All completely depending on hot the hormones hit that day.

The outside reaction usually results in me raising my eyebrows in disnelief and taking a deep breath before answering anyways in my most feminine voice possible.
i get annoyed
Sadness, the only person I generally get angry at is myself. The exception is politics will make me angry, but I think wanting to exist in peace is a pretty low bar.
I say, I don’t know them, so I don’t give a damn what their opinions are
I literally prepare for an incoming wave of bad vibes.

I usually then return to my normal mantras.

If you miss gender me once I may let it slide, if it's multiple times I will correct you.

It all depends how good I'm feeling that day and how affirmed I feel that moment.

Lately I've just been like 
""lol this person. Doesn't know I'm close to getting 1 'ma'am' for every 'sir'."" Wtf ever...other times if you call me sir more than once in an interaction I'll correct you and feel pretty euphoric later.

However telling myself that 'it doesn't bother me' is a sure fire ticket to depression and anxiety land. I mean I'm probably going that way anyway but it's nicer to head that way with myself intact.
I haven't even started HRT yet and look (and especially sound!) more masculine than feminine, so it's understandable when strangers misgender me. I still get a little sad.

To end on a positive note, last week was the first time a stranger gendered me correctly, despite me introducing myself by male pronouns for legal reasons. That was quite a suprise, but a welcome one.
So when I get misgendered I don’t take it personally unless it’s someone I know. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes and I don’t exactly pass or act my gender 100% of the time. Especially on the phone. I sound like a guy because voice training is expensive lol. It’s when they don’t correct themselves that I get upset
I generally look at the person confused and prepare for the worst.

In conversations where people are privileged to my transness, it makes me feel either disheartened or disgruntled based on my mood.  


Tangent, but the last time I felt this way was when I had let my facial hair grow a bit to give my skin time to heal and clear up and I had to go and pick up food due to a mix up.  I went boy mode for the first time in a year and that made me super dysphoric, I was both pissed and ready to break down in tears... it felt soul crushing and disgusting. I went home and packed the few articles of masculine clothes I had in boxes.  

Interestingly, I got more people staring at me weird when I was in boy mode for that run than I do when I dress as myself... so that's an oddly affirming thing.
Feels like a wave of intense heat flaring acrossed my body starting from behind my ears for some reason. How my body lets me know I need to grab my tongue, and temper before they take off.
If it’s a stranger I just keep it moving. If it’s someone I know I correct them and keep it moving. It only really upsets me (usually anger and then sadness) if it was intentional or felt microaggressive.
Dissociate a bit, devalue the person Misgendering me in terms of their worth/meaning to that of the traumatized teenagers I used to work with (anything they have or will say or do is meaningless to me as a person, my engagement is an act to keep them stable/safe and I don’t have to think about them after we part)

Sometimes it makes me sad/lonely/isolated/irritated but I’ve been in this shit long enough that having a reaction more than described above is too much mental emotional energy

Space out, move on, they aren’t my friends
So many varieties of misgendering, so many responses. So many fools, only two disinterested hands to slap them all.

Seriously it does hurt, still. I’m not a quiet one on it. I will deadass stop a conversation between multiple people to address this if I think it’s intentional. I don’t suffer hate crimes silently. I also tend to speak up if it’s for a sib in the tribe. 

If it’s a friend or someone just being super dumb, I am usually gentler. 

I get upset at night, laying in bed. That’s when it hurts me. I’m older though. Been out years. 

I find that telling someone they are a walkin’ talkin’ hate crime usually gets their attention. You de ISR if you want to deliver that with a smile or stone faced
Depends of who is misgendering me, if it's someone who I'm actually out to then it just annoys me for a while, otherwise I just kinda go numb since I'm pretty used to it unfortunately
I personally do not, with either of these options. Lol. I just dissociate and (if i did before) tend to never talk to the person again
I ignore it and move on. Most of the time, its done by strangers or people who I’ll have very minimal contact with over my life. If the contact and interactions become more frequent, I’ll correct them. Most people gender me correctly though, so I have a certain luxery others don’t.
Idk how else to describe it other then bruh moment
At this point, I'm used to it so I don't react or feel anything, but once in a while it becomes too much and I start bawling out of frustration. 

I'm very fem presenting because of my curves but I don't like anything other than he/him even when I wear fem clothes.

But yea like usually I'll just bottle it up and not really mention it until it happens like 50 more times.
It depends because some people make honest mistakes and will see yout you are what you are
It depends on the situation. Here's the way I handled it the last two times:

In the self checkout section of Walmart, I accidentally rang up one item twice, so I needed assistance from the clerk managing the area, a 20 something woman. Usually Cis women that age are supportive, but this one, after I thanked her politely for her help, said ""You're welcome, SIR"" with a sneering mean girl grin. My response was to go home and write a google review for the store, detailing the story and advising caution for Trans shoppers there. The two times I've been back since, I get called Ma'am by the greeters, so I think management reads those reviews and responded, which is to their credit.

The second time I was filling out paperwork with a government bureaucrat. She was making an abstract point about how paperwork is processed when she dropped a ""he"" while talking about my application. She gave no sign of being deliberately cruel about it, so I corrected her, on the spot. She got genuinely embarrassed, and earnestly apologized, and I very explicitly and kindly forgave her,and we both went happily about our days.

Each instance carried with it some internal seething, but nothing which I could not shake of pretty quickly; I am getting much better at managing my emotions since I started transition more seriously (stopped boymoding). 

But whatever your emotional reaction may be, it's valid. That's just my response to being misgendered.
Rage.
I don't care because I see a guy when I look in the mirror so if doesn't bug me as often as it used to
I space out, cry, then convince myself not to hurt or kill myself
disassociate, internalise, try not to jump off a bridge at 1 in the morning
I'm kind of used to it. I use my deadname and he/him pronouns at work so I'm usually not super surprised when it happens outside of work, I usually only get angry when people make no effort to correct themselves and are doing it repeatedly. Especially if it's obvious that they know they messed up and STILL don't correct themselves
1. Act like they aren't talking about or to me, or act confused, ask ""wait who are you talking about?"" 2. Dissociate unless I can't like I'm working or something 3. Get sad and doubt how I look or pass 

I don't get mad unless it's done maliciously by my parents or someone that knows I'm trans and knows they shouldn't be misgendering me.
Internally always internally
I’m still so new to this that getting gendered correctly makes me do a euphoric little double take, while getting mis-gendered is kind of what I expect
i stopped caring two turns ago, i just assume they misgendered bc they are uninformed, prejudiced or malicious, whichever option is it is not about me, and is between them and their therapist.
If it's a direct family member misgendering me: I don't care. They do it all the time and it's not going to change.

If it's one of my cousins or aunt's/uncle's: If I'm not out to the person, I don't care. If I am, they're polite enough to correct themselves, so it turns out okay.

If it's one of my friends: They have never misgendered me (thankfully). But I think I would probably dissociate and then get really sad later.

And, if it's a stranger: I dissociate and get sad later. Not too sad, because I know I don't look my gender. Not mad because, how was this stranger supposed to know? Just, dissociate so I don't make them feel like they did something wrong, and then get sad later that I don't look my gender.
I mostly have a freeze response, then try to evaluate if it was a slip up (especially with non-native speakers, where that's totally understandable). The exception is with students, where it's often technically misgendering, but in a colloquial ""catch-all"" manner (the students in my area refer to their teachers as ""dude"" and ""bro"" when expressing disappointment with decisions). There I don't react beyond giving a quizzical look and saying, ""I'm neither a dude nor your bro.""
i have been trans for most of my life before i even knew what 'trans' meant, and always referred to myself as the gender i identify with. so when it happens most of the time i don't even realize people are referring to me, but when i do i'm just indifferent or i get angry/sad because i feel like they're talking to someone else instead of me.
I had someone try to be mean on a picture I posted. They kept saying the usual ""Youll never be a woman"" etc but then she said. ""Resorting to a wig"" inadvertently she just complimented my natural long blonde hair 😂🤣

Side note: I was pointing out the definition of a woman would include 11-13 AFAB kids as they have the ""biology of a woman"". She didn't want to acknowledge it and decided I was not allowed an opinion as I was ""not biologically experienced"" 🤷‍♀️ Guess I'm not allowed to worry about predators of children.
Im not passing at all so i dont mind too much
disassociate and spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about it :/ then move on
Urgh. I try to shrug it off but these days it’s harder. Mix of dissociation and anger followed by inescapable hopelessness. Really stupid how bad this shit still affects me. Also really stupid how much I get misgendered despite having visible tits under my shirt, that are pretty fucking easy to see but being a trans girl is already a tick against me, the fact that I’m sort of a butch on top of that is another big tick.
Don't be shy correct them
Usually I get sad then dissociate. If it happens multiple times with no one correcting the people misgendering me, then eventually I’ll boil over in anger. Because I dissociate and get quiet usually, my anger seems to come from nowhere and causes more problems than it solves. 

Source: spending winter break with my transphobic family. I eventually started yelling “He! Fuck you!” at them when they misgendered me. Needless to say, they didn’t take too kindly to that.
I’m numb to it. I’m so used to it all that there’s no reaction. It’s just a part of my life I can’t change.
I wince, bottle it up and feel sad later, I'm closeted, it's not their fault.
I just stop, I feel like time has stopped, ppl are still moving around me but I don't talk anymore, when I go to my room I start the process of breaking down
Haha usually it's my own fucking family so I'll just let myself feel the dysphoria and then listen to music or remove myself from the situation to cope.
No I boil in anger first than cry
I get angry and dissociate. 

This usually lasts for about 1 minute. 

And then I spend the rest of the day shit talking them in my head. 

Between this and becoming a full license cosmetologist

My roast game has gotten phenomenal.
joke's on them, i use all pronouns.
It's hard to put energy into that anymore tbh I think most trans folk hit a point where they just can't.

i used to feel very angry and stop talking to the person who misgendered me
I’m agender so I rarely get gendered correctly by people, it doesn’t really bother me at all anymore because they’re strangers and it’s not like their opinion of my gender identity invalidates who I am
I don’t do either cis women get misgendered all the time.  I just ignore it and move on
I don't really mind tbh, obviously I do prefer being called a she, but when its my family, I do understand why they would prefer calling me a he, idk I never really felt anything when being misgendered but thats just me 🤷🏻‍♀️
This, followed by boiling internally and *then* crying 😅
Yeah usually it's an internal sigh/disappointment and then often progresses to locking up mentally where I don't really engage with anything happening around me
Mines, a dull pain followed by this
100% I put my head down and walk away
I just correct them and move and and am sad for the remainder of the day 🙃
LOL yeah that’s exactly how I feel. I’m only 16 so I look young, causing me to be more androgynous, so I can understand why people could think I’m a girl. But the only times I’ve ever been misgendered is because they’re trying to make me mad. And it doesn’t make me mad, I just think it’s funny because of how wrong it feels
I prolly feel worse bc I had to see my transphobic family yesterday haha
Uncomfortable yes, shameful maybe
Furious internal rage, I know they were talking about me
Literally me😭
Same:( I just cry later
Same
I try not to get mad at other people, I more just get a tsunami of insecurity after
Aw I know what that’s like I’m so sorry:(
Lolollll
Basically same, if it’s a kid I let it slide but like an adult I try to correct them
Aw:(
Same girl! I’ve been transitioned for over a year and a half now, I know I pass (normally lol) it now makes me feel like people just want me to have an ugly day
Good one I’ll use that next time lol
If people are on purpose transphobic and misgender me I probably will just ignore them and then cry in my car on the way home and if they’re accidental I’ll get really insecure thinking I don’t pass and not wanting to go into public for the rest of the day. Crying too haha
Me too!🥲
Dang I’m sorry about that. We shouldn’t have to deal with our own family and transphobia but.. we do🙃
Yeh :/ and I never correct people so if I’m not close with them and they don’t know, they keep doing it T_T
Yeah, I get that too. I tend to just sit down and stare off into space feeling awful unless I have something to do or someone that I am talking too.
Thanks I appreciate it. I’m usually not good at associating with others, but this subreddit really is a place of encouragement, inspiration, and like minded individuals. I never knew how common some of the issues I have faced were until I joined.
This gets them on the back foot...stammering.. if they say something about my andro voice I point to my neck scar (tracheal shave). ""Someone cut my throat when I was asleep."" \*NINJA STARE\* :-P
Lol little bit different, I was talking about my body when I was saying fronting. I have a dissociative disorder called OSDD1B.
 
 Movies and media have stigmatized it but before 1996 they used to call it multiple personality disorder.
 
now they call it dissociative identity disorder, or DID for short. I have a sub division of that called other specified dissociative disorder, or OSDD for short.
 
 There's no serial killer hidden in the midst like movies and all that makes it seem. 

It's essentially like having an apartment filled with people, and whoever fronts is the representative of the household at that time.

So when I say a trauma holder I'm talking about a person in my system who constantly relives traumas that I've experienced So when they're triggered they run to the front as the representative and are willing to bite someone's head off normally causing more problems than helping... 

When I say littles, I mean people who are the age of 10 and younger who are my system who front and be the representative and they tend to react drastically differently than someone who is like and they're 20s or in their teens.
 
 I don't know I could go into a whole spiel of what this is but that's a different topic.
 
 The point that I was making was depending on who fronts has a different reaction, that doesn't mean that we instantly go into angry fit mode or crying, we do try to correct them multiple times and then after a while we get frustrated and then shit happens. I don't know if that makes sense?
I know 😔 wish it wouldn't happen to any of us
A good cry never hurt anyone. I don't pass either. I have gotten to the point where I am too uncomfortable boymoding to keep doing it, and my emotional control over things like being misgendered has improved enormously since I stopped.  I honestly try to focus my attention on the people who are not cruel to me, and do my best to ignore the ones who are. That doesn't mean I never wallow in dysphoria, telling  myself  I deserve to be misgendered; only that I get over it faster and more completely than I used to.

The sadness I feel for any of us in Florida right now…	Mr Ron “Bigot” Desantis as won his bid for Governor again, and will unfortunately continue his hateful crusade towards us in his hellhole of an echo chamber. How such an ignorant man can rule one of the most popular tourist states baffles me, it amazes me that people can fall for his disinformation about transgender people, making laws with no backing in science or basic fucking empathy. I urge to get out if and whenever you can, cause it will only get worse…	"Please move to Michigan. We just showed everyone we care about lgbtq and women’s rights!
I'm equally angry and sad right now. I'm terrified Mastriano is going to win PA and try something similar.
I wish I could leave this state right now

Like fuck it feels like I'm trapped in this god forsaken hell hole known as Florida
I'm not in the US, but I can see where you guys come from. Whenever I hear about the situation there it seems like it's getting worse. Unfortunately Trumps election has opened the floodgates for even worse people to get elected and from what I can gather the Democrats don't think talking about trans rights would give them any votes. Hopefully things get better very soon.
One of the reasons that once I can leave, I will leave provided he hasn’t gotten his shitty face out of that position by then.
I watched the news this morning and what I got out of that (i don't live in florida) is that this man won (?) and might be running for the next presidential election? and according to the news station (i don't like the news people or politics) he most likely will be a front runner? is it cool to be scared of that?
The fact that so many children are going to suffer because of these horrible people..they won’t even allow puberty blockers. This world is such a horrible place.
Ron Deathantis is the literal definition of trash. I fear for what comes next for us while he’s in a position of power. If you’re in this god awful state rn, I feel for you and I love you, and I hope you can stay strong ❤️
I think all trans people should come to Canada. As a trans person you’re literally left the fuck alone here
I mourn alongside you. Fucking Greg Abbott.
yeah.... I dont know what to do or where to go. I was in fort myers area and moved more north. it doesnt get better...
I’m in florida and I’m a minor so I can’t go anywhere. I was hoping to start my transition while still in school and hopefully be the girl I’ve always wanted to see in my senior photos. I likely won’t be able to anymore and I’m absolutely wrecked. I just want to leave already
cope harder 60-40 😂
yeah.... I dont know what to do or where to go. I was in fort myers area and moved more north. it doesnt get better...
I don't live in the US, can someone explain this to me?
Yeah its a nightmare. I hate to see my home becoming so hostile. I can't live here anymore, im moving out of state in February
whem scared people get power... Dangerous...
I share your feeling. I want out of Texas so bad. It's like Texas and Florida is competing to see who can eliminate our existence first. Sadly the Supreme Court won't do a thing either. Guess Biden don't think we're important enough either. Sorry for the rant.
......and a great sadness washed over the land
What the hell is wrong with people, voting for facism & how can America stay United..you thought the British were bad
I’m in Florida 😢
yup heard all about it i hate it here florida sucks so much ass 😐
MN welcomes all LGBT ppl ❤️
I’m actually going to Iceland in a couple years. Heard they’re really friendly towards LGBTQ+ people.
He lost 🥳
Is he worse than Oz?

Edit: Oh my god, he’s really that bad.
Dems have very much been the party of women's, LGB, and trans rights. They do of course make more progress in areas that are solidly blue. DC, for instance, has mandated for years that all single-occupancy restrooms be marked as all gender. (Plenty of more recent stuff, that's just the first one in my head.) The Biden administration has also been very active in reaching out to the queer and trans professional communities to find people to place in political appointee positions. (White House roles, agency leadership and their staff, etc., versus the strictly nonpartisan positions that are the vast majority of government employees.)

But yeah, realistically, I think trans rights aren't going to motivate the average person to go vote. Trans rights just aren't a priority for most people.

I think in part trans stuff is becoming more *visible* in this country. Which paints a bigger target on it. It's obviously getting worse in areas, but it's getting better in others, too. That visibility doesn't just mean more enemies, it also means more allies. Better trans representation on TV, solidly blue states/cities putting better policies in place, etc. So the quick summary is... it's complicated.
Can confirm
Wow, the fucking piss baby won?
Basically DeSantis has been actively targetting and blaming the trans community, stripping us of legal protections and medical access. He's been leading the charge on villifying trans people as groomers and now he's retained his position as govenor
The fascists actually had a pretty bad election outside of Florida (and maybe Arizona & Nevada)
I screamed with happiness when I saw that this morning. I'm now safe in this state a little longer! ❤️
He literally ran a commercial saying he has the right to decertify any voting machine in the state (if he doesn't like an election result of course). I don't even want to know what he thinks about trans people, that alone was enough to be scared of him. If he becomes governor, I'm absolutely terrified of what could happen!
Oh yes. I mean Oz is a moron but Mastriano is something straight out of the Handmaid's Tale
Yeah, obviously the situation is complicated especially in such a big and divided country as the US. Of course when you come to this sub you see many cries for help from one of those red states so when you've never been to the country you could think everything is going through the gutter. And yes, things seem to be getting better in blue states but you're still lagging behind. In the Netherlands for example there is a huge chance of LGBTQ rights in general getting included in the constitution, there's gonna be a lot of work to do before that will happen in the US.
Oh wow that's horrible
Great, another GOP sore loser. Oz looking pretty tame compared to Mastriano. Still hoping for Fetterman to win though, hope his stroke wasn’t too debilitating.
Yeah me too. One of my Facebook friends was making fun of him for it, instant block. It's sickening how cruel people are getting."	yq6a4v	trans	96	0.95	2022-11-09 02:38:26

Tried out what would I look like with long hair, now I'm sad because it will take so long to grow		"Hey, do not be sad. You look absolutely amazing!❤️❤️
Girlfriend that is why we call them goals- sigh- I’ve been growing mine out for a year and a half and it’s still not the longest I have ever had. 
Focus on the positive, You look fantastic!
It is well worth the wait, even through the awkward phase. Been growing 17 months and it is down to my collar bone. Feeling it grace my shoulders is so euphoric. I no longer get triggered watching cis women play with their hair.
The best time to start growing out your hair is today. With the circumstances we're in these days, I wouldn't be suprised if you're able to get past the awkward stage by the end of the quarantine.
So what do u look like wuth short hair
I feel the same way but the only way to get there is to just grow it. Will give you something to strive for. Take a pic every month so you can see progress. A little bit of progress is some progress so it give you a boost. Before we know it we will have long flowing beautiful hair. Time flies.
You could try a really. I’ve wig or extensions in the meantime. Not necessarily for everyday use but to change it up.
Thank you!♥️
Exactly my thoughts here. I did the same and realized what better time than now. By the time I'm able to go back to work I be past the awkward have to wear a hat stage.
Yea but wigs are expensive :c
True. Nice ones will at you back. It might be worth it though if you ever have a chance to save. Anyway, no big deal. You’re beautiful with or without it!"	ghbrna	trans	90	0.99	2020-05-10 23:08:38
Was a transphobe, but now I think I’m trans -_- (16, mtf, venting)	"As the title says, I’ve been transphobic/homophobic for as long as I remember, but over the past month, I’ve started to realise that I’m probably trans. I’ve also realised that I’ve felt like this since I was much younger, I remember wanting to try girls clothes, or having long hair and just generally being born a girl, but I’ve just ignored the feelings until now. Wow I feel stupid. 
Looking back I’ve realised how much of a shitty person I was too. When I look back I realised that I was genuinely proud to be a “normal human being”. (Which is pretty sad when I think about it) My idea of normal was obviously cis, straight, white, male. Because of this I now I feel like I’m inhuman myself for feeling trans, which is how I genuinely viewed other people - as inhuman. That’s stupidly crazy! 

Generally I’ve just done pretty bad, I’ve made waaay too many offensive “jokes”, and I’ve also badly harassed some people. What makes this worse is that most of my friends and my family are also transphobic/homophobic, but if I were to ask any of my friends or family who the most offensive person they know is, they’d say it’s me. I’m seen as the worst person when it comes to doing all this stuff. Because of this, I’m expected by basically everyone to continue being a dickhead to every minority we see, so I’ve just got to hold up this facade as if nothings wrong and I hate it. I kind of hate myself too, I feel stupid for doing this in the first place, I hate that I’m a bully and I hate myself for thinking I’m trans too because I think I’m still kinda accustomed to being transphobic but now my aggression is just towards myself.

So where do I go from here I really don’t know, I’m stuck. There’s no point in thinking about coming out ever because it’s just not gonna happen, I don’t even know what I am and what I want at the moment so I don’t know. I’m just stuck in a cycle of being a shit person and hating myself now. I wish I could restart my life, or even just rewind a few years, this was not worth it at all. Morale of the story to anyone who read this, don’t spread hate for no reason this has kind of ruined my life and I don’t what to do with myself anymore. Whatever that’s basically it, I really needed to get some of this off my chest and vent, so do what you like with this post, doesn’t matter to me I’m on a throwaway account here."	"I don't really know how to express the amount of compassion and sympathy I have for you right now. I KNOW what it's like to be raised in the sort of environment that teaches you to look down on those people. It sounds like you were a product of how you were raised combined with a hefty dose of denial. If it makes you feel any better I was raised in a less hateful, but still decidedly homo/trans-phobic, and I didn't realize I was bi until I wasn't under their roof anymore, and trans until I was 26, so congrats on being able to actually question yourself and do some deep self-examination. 
I doubt, given the circumstances, you're going to be able to start expressing yourself until you move out, but you can start healing yourself by seeking out and apologizing to as many of those you were cruel to as possible. Ask for their forgiveness and empathy, odds are the people you spurned before will become your closest friends and strongest support network.
> Because of this, I'm expected by basically everybody to keep being a bigot to every minority I see, so I have to keep up this facade as if nothing's wrong and I hate it.

Please, don't keep up the facade. You recognize now how hateful you've been; don't throw away this chance to change. If you don't laugh as hard when your friends make jokes, if you stop harassing others, or even if you softly step in the way of your friends when they try, it will be a change for the better. If your friends ask why, you can just say you experienced something that changed your perspective--- because you have. You have a chance, girl. From the bottom of my heart, I hope that you use it.
16 is so young. You're expected to have literally zero self awareness or self reflection before that. That's not a dig, it's just how humans develop.

From here you focus on being a slightly better person every day.
First off, I'd like to say that I've done my fair share of stupid and regretful things when I was younger. That doesn't define who you are now, only who you were. As long as you're trying to do better, that's what matters.

If you hang in there a few more years all the college and/or adult independence stuff will give you a chance to redefine yourself and start over.
You dont have to be hateful now. Maybe your not in a safe place to come out and be who you are and transition but you don't have to be hateful. Just tone it back. Don't talk about it and just ignore situations like that. I don't want you to hate yourself and im glad you've changed. I dont want you to go through then next few years or something hating and bullying other and to an extent yourself.
> this has kind of ruined my life and I don’t what to do with myself anymore.

Embrace being trans, and start supporting LGBT people.

You're very young. It's normal that you will go through changes.
I was raised in a church environment where gays were literally ""abominations,"" and the trans...well we didn't even talk about the trans. If we did, it was to ""humbly"" proclaim that they just need to be helped to see the error of their ways and to become a ""functional"" person. 

So needless to say, I've done my fair share of gay bashing and derogatory comments about trans folk. 

But I didn't know what I didn't know. Hearing you say this only proves to me that you are a good person. Our beliefs/morality as children are 100% NOT our fault. However, only good human beings will notice their past failings and want to do better. 

So chin up, girlie! There's no wreckage of the past that cannot be turned to something useful. Use these feelings of disgust for your former self to remind you to be kind and accepting, always, and maybe to help someone else out in the future.

I love you, and I know you can do great things ✨❤️✨
I can relate somewhat to this, although I am not trans, most of my friends at similar age to you, were homophobic and full of hatred. 

What helped me was that whenever they would go on rants about anything, I would talk about something else with this other person, who I could see was made uncomfortable by them doing this.

Is there anyone in your group of friends who you think may not be so hateful? If there is, you could try to speak with them.


You could also try to find other people who you can be friends with who will be more accepting. You could try and distance yourself from the group. Maybe start spending more time with other groups of people and starting getting people to see other sides of yourself.

This could allow people to reevaluate how they see you and you could become friends with people who are kinder and more accepting.

However, family problems are something they I cannot really help you with (sorry I do not have any good advice)
Alright, so here's the thing. It's okay. All of it. Yeah, you probably said and did some fucked up shit. But that's just being human. What's important is now that you recognize that you were in the wrong, what do you do about it?

You're 16. There is 100% a reason all of society tells you that high school is when people build their identities and learn who they are etc. Your brain simply develops a certain way, and as it happens, it doesn't fully finish developing until your mid 20s, with the most significant changes coming in your teens. Nobody is immune to that fact, but I remember feeling the entire time that I was the exception.

I'm 29, found out I was trans when I was ~26. When I was going through school we didn't really know about trans people. Being ""gay"" was (and still is some places) the go to insult. For all intents and purposes I grew up as a cis white dude, so I understand the kinds of environments you're living in right now. I've been on both the receiving end of harassment and the giving end, and you know what I noticed? I pity the people who do the harassment. They have such a narrow and hateful worldview, concerned primarily about being comfortable.

This is not a condemnation of you. You seem to be starting to see it now. So I ask you, who do you want to be?

I'd challenge you to really think about this: if your friends only like you because you're a dick, wouldn't you rather find friends who like you because you're not a dick? School feels like the world to you, but it's not. At least, it won't be one day. Do you remember when you were 14? The time between you being 14, and you today is about the time left that any of the friends you have now will have an impact in your life (unless you choose to stay friends with them after high school). I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think you'd want to know before you make that decision whether they're genuine friends or not. Maybe they stop being friends. Make more. Maybe they grow with you. In either case you have the potential to give them that opportunity to grow and be the change in their life.

I'm not saying come out to them. But consider challenging them on their own bs while admitting your own past faults. Show them it's okay to admit you were being a dickhead. Show them they can admit fault - because remember, they might be going through exactly what you are (in terms of not wanting to be a dick but feeling socially compelled to) but are too afraid that they have to go along with the bs to maintain THEIR friends.

I'd also challenge you to think of the part where you said you'd never come out. It's fine if you never want to. But remember the difference between how you saw things 2 years ago and how you see them as you wrote this post.

In 2 years, maybe you feel you can. Maybe you want to. I dropped out of school at 16. By the time I was 20 and going to college I didn't give a shit what any of my high school friends thought or did.

I wish I had of known sooner. Looking back I had tons of reasons to know I was trans but simply wasn't given the information about what being trans meant. Comfort for me was being a cis white dude. Going to college, getting my job and just doing my day to day routine.

Ultimately you'll eventually have to choose between doing what's right and doing what's comfortable. That's a choice only you can make, young sis. Whatever you decide to do, know that people can understand and relate to what you're going through.
You have no idea how much reading your post has relieved me. It really takes guts to be this honest and vulnerable with yourself and others, I admire you for that. When I was younger (15-16) I remember thinking that trans people were a joke, as well as the issues they faced. I remember hearing transphobic comments from my family and repeating them, without thinking, it literally happened once or twice tops, but it still haunts me, everyday. I cannot believe I used to think like that. I am almost 22 now and I realized I am non binary, I am terrified to come out, I am so ashamed, I know that people would talk behind my back and I’d be rejected by the community, which is the most painful thing that could ever happen to me. So I’m stuck. I am transitioning alone, I will go get my surgeries alone, I’m scared of even trying to make connections with other trans people because I feel like I don’t deserve to be in their spaces. So I don’t really have a solution for you but I just wanted you to know that I feel you and you’re not alone

As a fellow in the closet, mtf, 16, and former bigot I feel your pain 100%. The things that you used to identify with always eating away at you. For me the thing that has helped me is to let people know that I’ve had a change in how I see the world and finding community with people at school who align more with my new beliefs. It sucks but I assure you, wallowing in your own past failures does not make things better. I believe in you <3
Hey, girl. I'm proud of you for starting your path toward what I can only assume will be tremendous personal growth. And at 16! That's fantastic. I truly believe you'll be a completely different person in no time.

A lot of trans people had what someone else referred to as a ""transphobic arc"". It's not okay, but it's generally not our fault either. When we're younger and/or in the middle of an emotionally abusive situation where we know that we can't stray from what our family says without facing severe consequences, we - almost innately - do what we feel is necessary to survive, and sometimes it's not pretty. That doesn't make it right in the grand scheme of things, but it also doesn't have to ruin us for life. We can *always* change. We can *always* grow. And it's okay to do so. It's *admirable*, even.

(And, just as a quick aside, you may see some people say something along the lines of ""you were hateful so you'll *always* be hateful in my eyes"" from time to time. I'll let you in on a little secret right here and now: most of the people who say things like that are probably covering for their own less-than-stellar past. Either that or they had the privilege of growing up in a much better environment and are looking down on people who didn't. Either way, you very likely haven't done anything truly unforgivable and those people can stuff it if they ever say that to you.)

Now, forgiving yourself may be hard. It might even be the greatest struggle of your entire life. But it *can* be done. And it's always worth it. Even if it take years upon years. The feeling that comes with finally and truly letting go is indescribable. And you'll experience several amazing little breakthroughs along the way.

The bottom line of all of this is that *you will be okay*. It may not feel like it on some days, but trust me, you *will* get through it. And you will come out on the other side as the beautiful and loving person you were always meant to be. I promise!

I'm rooting for you, sister!
You can’t blame yourself for your brainwashing, you grew up in environment where this was practiced, you felt there was something wrong with you at an early age, so you mimicked the environment to feel normal and you took it to an extreme to prove that you were in extra normal. But this prison is something you claim to have built, so it’s also yours to change. You are not a prisoner of your own character. Start by apologizing to those you wronged, and remind them your all 16, if anyone is worthy of forgiveness, it’s someone who is still majority their parents and only partially themselves. And then stop doing this behavior, no one expects it, that’s just your programming telling you that.
this is a totally understandable experience, practically every transfemme i know had their transphobic arc lol
but in all seriousness i feel you, i was also kinda transphobic and very much in the closet. it’s never too late to come out, even if you’ve done bad in the past. just be better now, things will be better for you too.
Character development
if you’re certain that your trans you should definitely transition in order to feel like yourself, it’ll probably help you become a better person and attract better friends. idk if this is helpful tbh but i just wish you the best!
I've been there when I was young too.  Take it as a lesson to be more tolerant and forgiving of people in general.  It takes time and effort to be a better person but it's worth it.
Sending hugs and love from a fellow transwoman. You're valid no matter who you are. Honestly 16 isn't that bad compared to some... Not that is very helpful, because at 16, a couple years still feels like an eternity. It's never too late to get your life figured out. Be glad that you're working on your journey of self discovery and are already starting to think for yourself. No matter what I support that.

Proud of you for breaking out of the hateful cycle. It's hard to do and I don't blame you for being in there. There are a lot of people stuck there themselves and don't know why they believe what they do.
What's been done and said can't be changed but, that doesn't mean you that YOU can't change. If you don't want be be a certain way, then don't. Damned with the expectations of others; what do YOU expect of YOURSELF? Do what's right by you, and you will do what's right by others. You're obviously a good kid by the fact that you feel so bad about your actions. Remember that new friends can be made, and family can be chosen. You got this 💜
Welcome to the trans family sister. We welcome you with open hands
I think a lot of them would just tell me to go away to be honest but I could try apologising to some of them, I’m not the greatest at apologies though. Thanks a lot for your response by the way
Tysm for commenting this actually, I really want to use this as an opportunity and when you put it like that I’ve found this quite helpful. I hope I can try to do this, even if only small steps at a time to improving myself. Ty again
Yeah but then I’m a little bit scared of losing my friends when they expect me to be hateful to everyone. I don’t want to continue with hating myself or others though so I don’t really know what to do going forward. I want to move forward from what I’ve done in the past but I’m kinda restricted because of everyone else, I guess some of it’s my fault aswell though
I wish I saw this sooner but it only just appeared for me for some reason. Thank you so much for this I feel like I’m really starting to understand everything and myself better. Still haven’t entirely decided on some of the choices I have moving forward, but I can at least understand the outcomes a lot better too so thanks again!
This is so well put! Ty for having this understanding too, I appreciate your help
Thanks so much, the support on this sub has been really great and I feel motivated to do something about this. Also these comments are relieving to come back to straight after an exam so thanks again I appreciate it lol
Time for new friends
I'm gonna be a bit harsh, but if your current friends only hang out woth you because of that one facade of yourself and wouldn't if you changed it, they probably don't care for who you are, but for who they view you as instead. Put in other words: Not genuine friends
Do they expect you to be? Or are you putting that on yourself? Next time you think they expect it just.. don't.. see what happens. There's always going to be someone else to fill the void, is my guess.
Of course, no worries at all.  


It's easy to be overwhelmed when you first start considering stuff like ""am I trans"", especially if it also makes you take a step back and realize you did or said some shitty things and that questioning causes you to empathize with the people you directed those things towards.  


Just remember that at the end of the day, life is not a race. It's not something you need to figure out now or in a week or a year. Even if you do some more thinking and realize you aren't trans, you can still take this experience as a lesson to help you develop personally. If you do decide you're trans, then you make the decisions that are right for you on how to action that. Some people don't ever take hormone therapy, some do. Some change how they dress, some don't. Some spend time and effort working on their voice, some don't. Remember as well that it's okay to experiment (btw if you want to experiment with voice training you could frame it as an interest in voice acting/singing to your family, there's a lot of overlap in skills/techniques used for voice feminization).   


Especially with how... ""in the news"" trans people and issues are right now, you're going to feel a lot of social pressure if you decide to take some steps and be public about it. I can't speak for how things will go for you, but I know that for myself as time went on it became harder for me to tolerate hiding who I was, and those social pressures started to not matter to me. I don't think saying ""They don't matter"" is helpful - those pressures do matter. But how much they matter is something that will change as you do. Maybe the pressure grows smaller as you make more tolerant friends, or you grow more resilient as you gain independence as a young adult. Or, you decide on a school in a more inclusive area and have less community pressure.  


Even if you get to a similar point I did, though, just keep in mind that you should do what's right/needed for you. But also that you should do those things on a timescale that works for you. Maybe that means you don't tell your parents until you're out of school and have a job/apartment of your own in case they react negatively. Maybe you're okay with just presenting feminine with some online friends that get it. Or... maybe in a year you're ready to have those tough conversations. It's all good. You've got a lot of options and no matter what you choose, life goes on.  


It's challenging, but exciting. It's socially terrifying, but there are also countless people with positive overall experiences who have made friendships that they never would have made otherwise. Keep your chin up and I hope that whatever answers you come to, you find happiness. Good luck!
Oh god
I mean yeah it seems like if your current friends won't support you you can look for new friends and be more open and honest with. That way you can be happier"	v74d61	trans	90	0.99	2022-06-07 18:51:21

My mom thinks detrans people and conversion therapy research means she has “been learning”	"Basically what the title says. I’m a 34 year old trans woman. Iv been out for…about 7 months now. Theres been an ongoing argument with my mom/entire family about how they will never accept me and they think I’m doing something evil and bound for hell as an abomination. I really don’t give a darn if they think that, but I won’t be around people that blatantly refuse to use my name or pronouns and my mom has stated that she “will NEVER use “that name”” 
Part of our last argument I said I would love to teach her about us since she still holds such ignorant views. Apparently she has been binge watching detrans people and their story. Told me that I am a fool for trying to make the outside match the inside. That I need to change the inside to match the outside instead. I told her that’s called conversation therapy and responsible for thousands of deaths and is illegal in many places. She says it’s illegal because “lgbt groups have a loud voice and want to control everyone’s lives!!!” She seems certain that after 10 years of transition I will face regret and kill myself or detransion . What else is a closed minded redneck like her going to think if all she consumes is detrans content? 
I’m sorry this rant became so long, I am just disgusted, sad, betrayed constantly. I started this transition from a point of suicide. I love myself more every day, but now I want the people around me to just die. What is wrong with people!!!?"	":(

I hope you can get out of there sometime soon.

You don't deserve to be exposed to crap like this.
Your family sounds awful, you have my sympathy. Always remember you are valid and loved.
The main reason that people detrans or commit suicide is due to people treating us so badly. If people would be supportive instead of being judge mental shits, fewer trans people would have these terrible outcomes. It’s a shame Christians can’t show the love that their fictional savior called them to show others. Religion poisons everything it touches.
Religion. Religion is what's wrong lol. Not all Christians are like this, but sooooooo many are 😭 im sorry about your family, having to cut people out is never fun...
Sounds like she needs to learn there are reasons conversion therapy is banned in a lot of states.
We want to control other people’s lives while we fight to control our own lives.  100% serious, who is the original troll that is thinking this stuff up?  Like the “lucrative trans industry”.  Care costs about the same as being a stressed out cis person with high blood pressure and cholesterol…  

Like it’s almost more frustrating because there isn’t actually any substance to debate.

Like bathrooms I can talk about. How do lesbians keep from checking each other out. I don’t know, we can discuss and investigate and what not before we call the whole deal stupid…. 

Maybe I’m just too new.  How do we get on the list for secret trans agenda planning meetings?  Hit me in dm with clues if it’s a scavenger hunt or something.
The insane cognitive dissonance in her head is astounding. LGBTQ groups want to control everyone’s lives? Yet she is trying to control yours and others? I will never understand. I’m sorry that your family is terrible. I hope you find a new family that loves you for who you are.
“LGBT groups have a loud voice and want to control peoples lives” certainly not the conservatives controlling their childrens lives. Forcing your child into an extremely homophobic space and making them feel invalidated is just a parental right, it’s not controlling at all! (Sarcasm in case it wasn’t clear)
>Theres been an ongoing argument with my mom/entire family about how they will never accept me and they think I’m doing something evil and bound for hell as an abomination.

What's stopping you just saying ""OK then. Bye!""

It sounds toxic and although we don't have enough info to advise I do think you should consider getting out of the situation.
Tell turn you no longer associate with  people who eat bacon, and call your mom a Godless pig eater.
The best part is you don't need them or their acceptance. 😊
I feel you. My mom is the same way, and although my dad used to be supportive, I guess my mom convinced him that I was hurting myself, so how both my parents misgender me!! Woo hoo.
I am so sorry. So many people just can't stand to be shown the truth.  It's like if one little thing changes in there little world it makes them paranoid about everything in that little world and the realize there whole belief system is is just a house of cards ready to collapse.
She has been learning.

How to echo propaganda and bullshit. Sounds like ""Cut out of life asap"" material.

Good luck.
By the sound of it, the thing that's wrong with these people is the fact they let a thousands year old, misogynistic fantasy novel steer their lives.
Uuugh! That is so horrible I'm sorry.

Would personal stories of transitioning saving lives help? Or would she just keep a closed mind because it goes against the stories she's heard that support her narrow views?
Thank you. I want to leave so bad. Block my family in every way shape or form and just go see what happens. I will be a homeless street girl before I come back to this bullshit
Thank you. It is terrible. My mom literally feels like she’s a victim of me being trans. It’s all about her ideals and convictions. It just goes in one ear and out the other when I say things to her like “self centered or selfish”. It’s all about her embarrassment, and the fact she is “revolted by a man playing dress up like a woman” her words not mine. I do want to leave, but i own a house that my parents helped me get the loan for…so their name is on it. I have to go through them to sell my house before I can think about leaving and that just seems like….so fucking much
Also, any idea why it says there’s 4 comments on my post…but I can only see 2? Well 6 total now that iv added 2 lol
I’m not sure lol. I feel like she needs to talk with a professional. She may discount them as well. But anyone that’s trans that speaks to her I’m sure will automatically be written off as an agent of satan before they even open their mouth.
Whatever you do, prioritise your safety.

You get to decide who is in your life and who counts as family.

But it's a delicate balance between preserving your mental and emotional health and ending up in a physically vulnerable position.

I wish you the best of luck. It sucks that they're putting you in this position. :(
She belongs on r/raisedbynarcissists
There were at least 3 that were [removed almost instantly](https://i.imgur.com/Vjx4L9p.jpg)

Probably hate speech for reddit/ mods to catch that quickly
Well I'm definitely not a Satanist but she can think what she wants :(

Why is religion so often a tool for hate and intolerance :(
I wonder why they were removed? I saw the notification pop up on my phone and could read the first couple sentences of the comments and they didn’t seem to be hate speech. Then I open the app to see what all they said and nothings there…but it still says there’s a new comment in the counter 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️"	wzvvd6	trans	88	0.95	2022-08-28 13:44:58
No chasers after surgery	As soon as I’ve had the GRS op all my “chasers” have disappeared, it’s so sad how I thought some of these guys cared for me? Yet they only were interested in me for a fetish. Since I’ve had the op these “chasers” stopped contacting me. Luckily my surgery has opened up more doors for other men :) has anyone who has had the op noticed this?	"Deff sucks and based on all the conversations I've had with men, it is most likely a fetish. I hate how much trans people attract the wrong mindset.
I hope to find out soon enough, currently still waiting for GRS. Have however been rejected because of it, and a bunch of guys have been trying to get more out of it because of their fetish view on it. It's really a shame people go that way.
I've expiernced this some, it's why my brothers are usally cautious on the men I bring around too. What's shocking to me is the fact these men sometimes don't even hide the fact that we're some kind of fetish to them 🙄!! 
-Peace and love ✌💕
same here
I’m gonna be loudly faking like ive had it already if I ever feel the presence of a chaser
Yep it's a thing. But I still find there are guys out there that still want to 'chase' us for different reasons. 

\- Older guys who can't get 'natal' women anymore.

\- Guys who want their girl to wear makeup all the time, etc

\- Guys who enjoy masculine facial features on women

Mind you, the last two aren't as abhorrent IMHO
Chasers want the organ. The female package is useful to them only so far as they can tell themselves they are not gay.

Once the organ is gone, chasers move on.
trans man but i have absolutely had men try to talk me out of bottom surgery 'for my own good' when I could absolutely tell it's that they wouldn't fuck me after.
It's horrific how men get off sexually on our extreme, horrific body dysphoria.

You know the three words I want to say: m## a## t##sh
I was waiting to see this happen but to be honest anyone who was into me for a fetish was pretty obvious before hand and I blocked them out of my life. The guys that were hollering before are still hollering now, the straight guys I was romantic with before are still as interested now. 🤷‍♀️
Well that’s fine as I can just date normal straight guys
Wow, as if them getting off is so much more important than your identity. That's so shitty
Nonbinary and same or start ridiculing me for mainly wanting to use a prosthetic
They usually try to frame it as ""ohhh... but it can go so baaad...and you might not enjoy seeex...""

But also they bring it up like. First or second conversation so you know its that they wanna know how long they have with your original plumbing. Even if its a hookup convo- or especially then I guess, lol, I don't know you like that anyway. 

jokes on you fuckers I haven't decided yet but I am damn sure gonna get real weird with it.
Lol, that'll teach them not to mess with you. Selfish assholes."	nlarar	trans	90	0.99	2021-05-26 07:11:16
Enby people who identify as trans! Are you feeling dysphoric? Please let me draw you!	"*It's free!*

Hello! I hope it's okay to post it here!

I'm a Brazilian transmasc artist who loves doing art projects from time to time ( LGBTQIA+ ones mostly!) 

Last year I did enby people portraits ( It's still up at my previous account) and now I want to do a new one involving trans people, not matter how you identify as! 

I've been searching for people who openly have been feeling dysphoric or sad about their looks lately so I can try reassuring them and make them feel valid with a portrait of themselves!!

Usually most people I see ( I randomly pick selfie posts or folks who have posted at least one to work on ) are trans binary ones. As an transmasc  enby, I like to put nonbinary representation into my works, no matter the gender identity. ( agender, genderfluid, demigenders etc)

I know essentially nonbinary people aren't exactly cisgender but it's up to us if we view ourselves as trans or not. ( It's a gray area, really)

If you feel comfortable or have already posted a photo of your face, please fell free to say "" hey I wanna be drawn"" and I will do so!


*( IMPORTANT INFO: If a lot of people are interested, I probably won't be able to draw everyone. It's a free art project and I put a lot of work in each artwork I do;

I probably will post some or all artworks in the last day of December/ first day of January here;

Please be patient, it can take hours or even days to finish a portrait!)*"	"May you please draw me?

( BTW I saw your post on r/Autism! Is everything okay? Do you need someone to talk to?? I was diagnosed 2 years ago and it was really difficult to find proper professional help. Familiar support was hard as well but now things are better, I think!)
Hey! I think I got too many requests for detailed realistic portraits, but I can surely do a sketch of you at least, if it's okay?
I'm glad you think so!! 

I love representing the community I'm in! We may not know each other but we are a minority and should stay together, celebrate our identity and respect everyone.

It's the sad truth about our society..		"""But what about the one NOOOORMAL person, that would regret it??? I mean who cares about those UNNORMAAAAAL people anyways, as long as we can save that one NOOOORMAL person."" - good ol' transphobes

The good ol' let's save one person and sacrifice 99 others... wait... ah yeah it's trans people, so...
Nah fuck that guy. Should be watching where he's walking.
In my lived experience, I think the equation is false.
Who would that one person be? Who the f is in mortal danger by me being just me? 
Exactly. 

There's no ""one"" person who could potentially go on the tracks and need rescuing. Absolutely not, imo.


There's just trans people on the side tracks, bothering no one, while being strapped by society (emotionally, medically,...). 

And there's a free running trolley going nowhere.

Still there's a part of society that lingers around, pondering about the question if the trolley should go down ""unused"", when it potentially could run over trans people.

Because trans people are different and enmity and fascist character don't allow that."	pz376n	trans	85	0.97	2021-10-01 07:47:30
I CAME OUT!	"Look, I get that it's the 1,573,692nd post about coming out on this Subreddit. But I just have to tell someone!

I am a 15 year old transfem... AND I CAME OUT! 

My parents are actually supportive. I am on a vacation, my grandma's there (Aka. The cutest roll of a lady you'll find), and I just thought she would be a massive support system! I was right!

I'm finally going to be able to have gender-affirming care, AT 15! I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS EVEN POSSIBLE! _Trans squeal_

_Insert rant about how I'll never get a quince and that still makes me sad beyond explanation._"	"Congrats! Be very thankful for your family, you got one of the good ones
This might be the 1,573,592nd post but ill never get tired of seeing them! 

CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
How does one achieve this level of confidence? I'm 22 and the thought of coming out to my parents terrifies me
There’s been so much negativity in my world lately and reading about your success has made me happy tonight. Just wanted to say that, I am genuinely celebrating you right now - I’m glad you have a supportive family, and I’m excited for you to experience life in the way you were meant to :)
Im slowly building up the courage, formulating in my mind what I can say to show the suffering ive had all my life
that’s so awesome and exciting ! congrats !!!!! have fun on your vacation !!!
Even if it would be the billionst post like this I'm still cheering for u 🥳🥳🥳 u can be very proud of yourself
Congrats!  I am very proud of you :)

I love that you could find a save enviornment to express yourself in.  At 14, I know that I could never come out to my parents because of their homophobia and transphobia which gets worse with other family members.  Most recently, my cousin came out as gay and everyone is bashing him for simply being gay!  My parents also speak on their transphobic beliefs at my face so it is clear I would not get support.

I hope I come out to them someday.. but only as nonbinary because xenogenders may never be understood fully.
I'm so so so happy for you

I didn't figure it out until 25 - but it's still a journey I'm incredibly excited to be embarking on

Stay safe - I hope school isn't too rough for you
I am! Now I don't have to develop a manly jaw, now I don't have to have a massive brow bone, etc. 

I think I'm a late bloomer, as I am also shorter than most people my grade, and look very close to androgynous.... 

My life went from awful to good in the span of an hour. EEEEE!
Confidence? No, tired is a better way to put it. I can rest now... I can finally stop suffering. I am finally free.
Aw, thank you. I hope that all that negativity will someday turn into positivity for you. Be safe out there.
Enjoy it girl, and always stay with your family if you can
That's an amazing way to think about it, thank you
I definitely will now, I'm so happy they are what a family is supposed to be.
No problem, and take care, I hope it goes well for you with your parents. :)"	tq1dhp	trans	83	0.97	2022-03-28 04:39:28
How Do I Cope with the Childhood I Never Had? (23 MtF)	"I'm grateful to have finally realized that I'm a trans woman, but as is the case with a lot of us, dysphoria and self-doubt have been creeping in. Maybe one day in the distant future my family will be accepting, but that seems like a long ways away, and for now I'm clinging onto the ways I can experience euphoria.

One of the biggest sources of pain came from seeing my family members recently attend a quinceañera (a Mexican coming of age party for 15 year old girls) and I got sad knowing that I would never get to have one. There aren't many women in my family, but everyone has had one, and instead of getting a coming of age celebration where everyone gets to see me become a woman, I instead have to fight for a handful of specific family members to accept me as a woman while the rest misgender and disown me.

It got me sad about all the other events and milestones I could have experienced if I had realized sooner in my life, but because of the transphobic and homophobia in my household, I couldn't realize until 23, now that I'm done with high school and college. I wish I could have gone to homecoming and prom in a dress. I wish I would have befriended my LGBTQ+ peers in High School instead of thinking I didn't belong. I wish I could have joined my cousins and friends for girls nights. I wish I could have played with easy bake ovens and painted my hair instead of being forced to play sports and be told I was a wimp. And I wish I could have pictures of a younger smaller me but as a girl.

All of those chances are behind me, and right now I'm pretty lonely as I search for jobs with a film degree that hasn't done much to help right now. I'm living in a small town with my partner who does love and support me, but I have no friends aside from a small handful of online friends, and I barely talk to my family (aside from a couple of supportive cousins I've come out to). Trying to embrace being a girl for the first time in my 20s feels weird. It's hard when cis women have had such a head start. It infuriates me knowing that there will always be records of me as a cis male, and that my mom will always cling to those records/pictures and see that as the true me.

I never would have been supported if I came out while younger, but I want those experiences I missed out on, not things that trans women can't experience, but certain milestones and events that I could have had. I feel like my only real hope for being involved with these experiences is to have a daughter when I become a parent, but even then, it's impossible to determine what gender child you get, and maybe they will identify as more masculine, and I don't want to be the parent that forces their child to have the things I never had even if they don't want it. Even then, it wouldn't be the same as experiencing those things firsthand.

I guess I'm trying to figure out where to go from here. I could throw myself an adult quince but for an older me to symbolize my transformation into being a trans woman haha, but I don't have enough close people in my life to go and right now I'm so self-conscious that it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to go there to validate me. I'm also getting married to a cis woman next year and that's already a nightmare to plan and we don't really have friends to invite, plus it would be awkward for a married adult woman to throw herself a quince. Honestly I'm also just in desparate need of friends, whether it be online or in person. I mostly just want to feel validated and special, and I wish I could justify having that as a trans woman. If anyone can help me feel better that would be appreciated. I'm also looking for possible friends, especially trans people in their 20s also living in the US. Thanks for making it this far and creating a safe and supportive environment."	"If it makes you feel better, a lot of us feel this way.

And this is why finding a queer community is a good idea. I think they'd understand that you missed some stuff, and maybe help you make up for lost time.

I realized when I started HRT that I am in 2nd puberty, and am calling it a redo :p
23 is still young, btw. You have a lot of time for beautiful first times.
I would recommend getting involved in queer community, and specifically, putting yourself out there in terms of finding a sense of sisterhood with people? That’s something that has helped me make peace with my lost teenage years
Have a Ventiquinceañera? 

It being a misuse of the spanish language aside, invite your found family after you make it, and the friendly people in your family, and do those things now. It's not too late. Make new friends, do the things.
I'm also struggling with this. But I've talked to people about it and I think almost everyone feels that way, regardless of age - even teens mourn their lost years.

I'm not over it, but I feel like once I've gotten a taste of what the future could be like and actually have some hope for myself, dealing with my lost past will be easier.

I'm also not a psychologist, but your post kinda screams ""depression"" to me. I'd suggest seeking out treatment for that, if you have the option.
I think we all face this at some point. But what I realized is that while we may not have the TYPICAL childhood, we all have A childhood. And not everything has to be typical. I don't share a lot of what most girls experienced, but I still did things. I had friends. The experiences were real, and they shaped me. And my grappling with my identity was real and that shaped me too. So my recommendation is to avoid comparing your story to other people, and just accept that it's YOUR STORY.
Sad story :(
I'm just having a hard time finding that community. My town is small and I'm awkward when it comes to being outwardly social, but at the same time I love having good friends. I'm job hunting too and I don't know if I'll stay here too long, and I've already made and lost so many friends over the years because we never keep in touch.
This. Also a while ago i watched a video about this kind of stuff done by a transwoman, her suggestions was to, getting some of the toys you wanted as a kid and gathering and having slumber parties etc... silly or not, doing so probably would lif a lot of this mental weight on OP’s shoulders

misgendered	"I'm so tired of being misgendered. I didn't start T, I'm not out to my family yet but I thought that I looked masculine. I'm misgendered everyday by random people in stores or coffee shops or wtv. I'm binding, I have really short hair, I dress masculine and people are like ""lady"" this, ""lady"" that and I'm so so tired. 
I'm thinking to stop going out and stay home everyday because it makes me so fucking sad.

What can I do to look like a fucking boy?"	"Hi! I’m AMAB. But, when I was a preteen in theater, we used stipple sponges and makeup to give us a 5 o’clock shadow. You have to play with it a lot to get it the way you want. But, stipples are stupid cheap and could help! Good luck, brother!
[Afab here] I'm having the same problem. I'm sure it's because of my voice. For the most part I move and look like a clean-shaven short fat man, but the second I open my mouth everyone knows. 

I have a pleasant voice - my nieces have always said that I sound like a disney princess.... But although that was fine when I was pretending to be a girl, it's just weird now. 

Go on, envision Danny Divito with Princess Ariel's voice.
Hang in there bro.

Society likes to gatekeep masculinity and I think this sadly means that people who are clocked as AFAB are often presumed to be women — like, it won’t cross their mind that they’re trans in the same way it might for a woman who’s clocked as AMAB. I am speculating here ofc. Is just my personal reading of things.

All I can say is this will pass. I relate to how tough this is and it was the worst part of my social transition. I did get through it and I’m sure you will too — you’ve come this far already, and you’re doing really well even just realising that you’re trans and coping everyday while closeted. The community is proud of you and is supporting you<3
If you want pointers, you can try posting to r/transpassing and people there might be able to give you some tips
Most people can't pass without hrt.
Shoulder pads!!!!!! Wearing jackets with shoulder pads it will make your silhouette a lot more masculine. Also it depends on your face shape but hats could help your face look more masculine along with fact that most people who wear like basbeball or flat bill hats are guys. This also depends on your style but you could wear doc martens, combat boots, chunky sneakers, etc that will make you taller. I hope these help!! 
EDIT
Also look up body shapes on google and find out what body shape you have and then look up fashion tips for guys with that body shape. Shorter guys who may have a rounder body shape might wear a suit with vertical stripes and black dress pants and black dress shirt to appear thinner and taller because black will make your body look smaller and vertical stripes will help people read you as taller as well and mens suits are made to make guys appear more tall having one block of color that goes from top to bottom will make you look taller.for another example you could have red pants and a red shirt that go good together, then you could wear a jacket with shoulder pads and vertical stripes or just anything that looks good the the red outfit. the red block of color will make you look taller on its own the vertical stripes would just add to the effect. Shorter necklaces like chains will make your shoulders look broader while longer necklaces will make them appear thinner. Same thing for necklines a deep v neck will make your shoulders appear thinner while a crewneck shirt would make them appear broader. Okay I think that’s all the tips I have. Actually one more thing horizontal stripes will also make your shoulders appear broader but they’ll also make you appear shorter.
All about a mind shift, gotta learn to not care about strangers perception of you. I look like a dude in every way but I'm always misgendered cause I have a big chest. Sucks but gotta stay strong
Hi! I just wanted to start this off with it definitely will get better and easier to pass in public. You won't be forever stuck in it. I know it's frustrating hearing that now but I was surprised that it did get easier myself. 
One thing that really has helped recently was getting pants that are lower waisted. You have no idea how much of a difference it makes!! It feels a little uncomfortable at first to wear pants lower on your hips but it definitely gives the appearance of a longer torso. :) 
And at the end of the day, the general public is stupid anyway and other trans people will see you for who you are in your heart. Soon the general public will catch up too but for now, do what makes you the most happy because the opinions of strangers really don't matter when you are looking like a fly guy. 
Stay cool and be safe!! B)
hey, I'm going through the same, it sucks I'm sorry that happened to you. i don't know any advice for you, people are just blind, i don't understand them. but you're not alone buddy :) good luck
Unfortunately the more you obsess over passing the more you'll get frustrated when you don't.  


Voice training, mascara beard and contour can help with passing tho, if you still wanna keep trying. People are super oblivious tho, even the well-meaning ones, so even that may not be enough.
I will try to find things like that! Thank you so much
I truly understand, I look like a clean shaved short fashionable man but when I talk people call me lady and stuff like that.
We will get through this bro! We are together fighting this, good luck on your journey
In terms of advice: I found shoulder exercises at the gym really helpful, and also painting on stubble + contouring your face can help.

I did occasionally pass pre-T but it is very difficult. I think something that helped me was looking like a fashionable man and not just a man if that makes sense. Basketball top, durag, nice tractors (I’m mixed so you might need to shake it up a bit). Looking like a certain kind of man on top of just looking like a man if ygm. But it’s still pretty difficult without hormones.
I'm almost crying, thank you so much, that means a lot to me <3
Thank you so much!
My friends tell me that I look masc but maybe I don't
Thank you so so much, this is so helpful.
I love to wear men suits because of that! I'll try those things, once again thank you
You right, we can get through this bro!
Thank you so much for those words, thank you so much for the validation! Stay cool!!
I'm sorry that happened to you too, we are together in this! Good luck
Maybe you right, thank you so much!
No problem! Just ask if you have any other questions. 💜
I try everyday to look like a fashionable man, I like fashion a lot. Thank you for your advice!
I'll try to exercise my shoulders too!
Maybe you do, maybe they're just trying to be supportive, maybe both. But looking masculine and looking like a man are different things. I'm sure you'll get there eventually. It may take a while and some effort but you'll likely get there.
Without t you most likely don’t
You right. I guess I need to wait and try new things to pass
Thank you anyway"	wq3e1e	trans	84	0.95	2022-08-16 19:35:57
I picked a name!!	I don’t know but I feel like I have to gush about myself somewhere, so, Juliette, I’m still thinking about nicknames and stuff, but it had to stay with the letter J and be Jewish in origin. Julie is my current go to. I dunno I’m just so happy right now! I feel like I can actually take the next step and start doing stuff, like I couldn’t until I started leaving my previous self behind. It’s very liberating if not a little scary and sad. I hope that this is the right one as I’ve picked names before that didn’t pan out, but this one feels the most right so far.	"Love it Julie! 😘
Congrats, Julie!!! I'm so happy for you. I know that when I picked mine, I was so excited to start using it the same same day
Congratulations Juliette! Beautiful name.
Juliette... a truly lovely name! Congrats :)
Congratulations Julie! And can I just say that this is probably one of the most wholesome subs on Reddit as everyone is so supportive to each other. But again I am happy for you and I hope you do well and find life better/more enjoyable now.
That's a pretty name! Glad you love it :)
Hi Julie, I'm Emily 😊
Juliette is a beautiful name! Congrats girl!
Congrats Julie!
I love the name. I picked what I want mine to be a few months back, but havent started my transition yet...

But I think Grace has a better ring than my current name...
I'm glad someone else it taking this name, cuz I won't be using it for much longer. May it bring you all the euphoria :)
Team -ette! My name is Lynnette :3
Yes! I love the name!! Good luck on your journey:D
SCREEEEE idk if i wanna change my name or not likei have done options but congrats! Julie is a pretty cute name!
Don't be afraid to change. Don't be a static character, the reader doesn't care for static characters. What I'm trying to say is that you should change if it feels right. I'm not very good with words so hopefully, this made sense.
Hello Julie! I’m Kristen. Congratulations!
Thank you! I just can’t even describe how happy I am right now.
Hey Emily!
In my opinion, if you like Grace more than the other name you chose, just take it, you haven’t started transitioning yet, your current name isn’t on and legal documents, like I said I went through muiltiple names before finding one that resonated the most. Best of luck!
May whatever name you choose bring you just as much, if not more
I believe it’s a French suffix for “little”
Great name btw
Heres a fun one: State of Tennessee wont allow you to change your legal name... Or gender on your birth cert.
Thank you! Your names really pretty as well
That sucks. Hopefully it will get better soon, but remember, that flimsily document that the government gave you when you were born doesn’t define you. Your name is personal to you, and nobody can force you to take one that doesn’t fit. Like how people call small medical bandages Band-Aids, the name you choose for yourself matters equally, if not way more than the name you were given."	k6fxk8	trans	81	0.98	2020-12-04 07:00:00
The Death Of The Woman That Never Existed	"The label of man is too heavy to bear, but to strip myself of it and lay myself bare even heavier. I'll surely be crushed, if I'm not first shushed. 

Masculinity lingers like a grey depressed rain cloud over my head, sticks to me like sour honey and trails my dragging footsteps like a starving couger. 

Some shake their shackels and slumber, awakening anew, a beautiful blossoming of daintiness. A rebirth, the very form of creation and reimagining of oneself. 

My sleep will forever be restless and every morning the same. My eyes open to stubble and muscles and throbbing. Trucks and hunting and baggy cloths. 

I began thinking of this version of myself as old and I thought I was ready to start mourning him but the world wasn't and now I weep for the woman that never even got the chance to be born.

I was so close I could taste it but now that's all her memory will be, a sad aftertaste impossible to rinse out that I cover up with chain smoking.

Followers; No, Not the Transphobes, Some Other Ones	"This was a comment I made in reply to another post, but I figured it deserved its own post.

The transphobic user name followers, I just delete, they don't bother me at all. In fact, I giggle a little bit at the sad life all of them have, thinking that they are actually accomplishing anything at all by their efforts. It's actually kind of pitiful.

What does bother me, as a transgender woman (with some SFW pics posted on reddit) is when someone with an obvious sissy fetish follows me. Not trying to kink shame, at all, it's perfectly fine to have a sissy fetish, if that's your thing.  What's not fine, and what squicks me out, is when someone with a sissy fetish follows a transgender woman (with no indications that said woman is at all interested in the sissy culture or fetish) because they think that transgender = sissy.

That's flat out just not right."	"Yeah that feels incredibly icky.
100%
Seriously, just…ew.
Absolutely 100% feel the same way. Have had a few of these types of accounts follow me on Reddit and Instagram too and those ones always make me feel a little iffy.
I got the same follower I think. That was my limit and I turned off the notification type. The transphobes didn't bother me as much as the ""sissy ownership"" bs
I’ve had this happen to me. Someone with a sissy fetish on an obviously brand new account followed me and messaged me saying that I needed “a daddy and a man to support me through my transition” as well as some sexual advances about being validated as a sissy. Needless to say I was pretty disgusted.
This is nasty, and I really don’t mean to kink shame or anything but why do chasers/sissy even exist? Is it like a power fantasy? Is it just thinking that having female and male sex characteristics are hot? Also, why do they have to be creepy!? Just say “Hi! I’m Tomothy, I think you’re cute. Do you want to go on a date and maybe do the s3x thing?” I feel like people are being creepy on purpose and throwing away their chances with the person they want to do the s3x thing with. 😤
The thing with fetishes is that they should still involve some degree of consent. It’s gross as fuck if you’re randomly searching the net to find folks to fetishize that aren’t consenting to being fetishized. Stating that or calling out that type of behavior is not shaming at all..
Agreed, 100%
pretty gross!!!
Ugh. Gross.
Agreed, 110%!
What’s worse is when they message you with that mindset thinking that for some reason you’re going to reciprocate and be interested. Yeah.. nope. Instant goodbye.
Do you mean instant report and block?"	onitf9	trans	84	1.0	2021-07-19 17:28:55
do you get offended/sad if someone asks your pronouns?	just a question, i would like to hear from other transgender people because me and my friend sometimes talk about it and it's very interesting to hear everyone's opinion	"i can see why some people would, it could make them feel that maybe they don’t pass or if that person isn’t out they then have to lie about it which can be upsetting. but overall i think it’s more respectful to ask than to just guess
Not at all. I think it’s pretty common now to ask anyone their pronouns, as the way someone’s presenting at any one moment doesn’t dictate their gender identity. 

One of the biggest things I try to spread in the trans community is “as long as people are GENUINELY trying, take that as a positive.”
No, not really. It's usually a good sign that they care enough to try and not offend you.
If I'm in a group of people, and am the only one asked, then it can feel a bit shitty. Still, being asked is nowhere near as bad as people assuming wrong. So I'd rather people ask or go gender neutral until corrected for everyone, followed by asking/gender neutral for people who you might be the slightest bit unsure about. Because that is still far better than being called 'ma'am' when my voice is now literally deeper than my cis father.
I’d rather somebody ask and use my correct pronouns than have them not ask and misgender me
Yes. Because I always think to myself it should be obvious and I don’t know why someone would question that. It just makes me feel like I don’t really pass that well or like that I look like I’m in between male and female. Idk. I get really stuck in my head on this shit when it happens :-/
I mean if it was JUST me and no-one else, then I guess? But if they’re asking everyone that (or I don’t have any proof they’re not) then I think that’s quite nice. I’m a little sick of people just assuming shit about me. Also it has the added bonus of greatly decreasing the likelihood that the person I’m talking to is horribly transphobic.
I've personally found it better when people ask. It feels much more respectful than just assuming no matter what pronouns they assume I use. At my college (I live in the UK and I've graduated now) asking for pronouns was common practice. Generally, people used they/them for everyone until they had been told which pronouns were preferred. It felt so much more inclusive and it wasn't offensive in any way because everyone was asked, regardless of gender expression.
I get extremely happy, because it means they're taking the time. 

Beats being misgendered until I correct them.
Makes me feel bad as not passing perfectly, but i know i don't currently anyways.
But I'm not offended in fact it's appreciated for what it means-wanting to be respectful
No, it’s usually people wanting to make sure they don’t misgender you. I usually ask anyone for their pronouns. As long as it’s not like maliciously asking them ig…
i do but not in the offended kind of way just i wished people would just look at me and automatically think i am he him, I'm glad they don't assume.
Sometimes yeah. It depends on who is asking me and if they are asking other people or just me.
Depends on the situation. If they ask everyone, it's fine. If they just ask me, it feels like they clocked me.
Nah, i think it should be common practice for meeting people.
It really depends. I have been in group settings, where someone asked for pronouns in the beginning and we all just said our pronouns and that was that, I'm completely fine with that and even think it's a great idea. 

Sometimes when I'm out with friends and I meet someone new they'll ask me about my pronouns (not on hrt yet, so I get the confusion about it) and honestly I then prefer it if they just take me aside and ask my privately. It hurts a bit that I don't pass but I know that they just genuinely don't know. 

I absolutely hate it though when people ask me in front of everyone (only me, nobody else). It makes me feel like an outsider and it happend even in situations where it should have been clear, cause I've been gendered correctly by my friends the whole time. In this moment it just feels pretentious.
I don't care about it. I know I pass pretty well, and usually people just are asking out of politeness.
It's nice if people get it right...
I try not to, but I do. To me, it means that I’m not passing the way I want to. If everyone asked each other what their pronouns were and this was a common practice I’d feel differently, but this is not a question that cis people and binary passing trans people typically get asked. That being said, I’d much rather someone ask me then guess and get it wrong.
Depends who's asking, most of the time it's chill but sometimes I get real anxious about how they'll react
I get very excited because it means that it won't be rude if I have to correct them later :3

(I mean, it's not really rude either way but I still feel like it is)
i only get a little sad when people i came out to along time ago do
I don't personally get offended, but it does sting a little. Because, I want people to know without asking if I am being honest.
Personally I feel uncomfortable especially if there are other people there so I think as long as it’s one on one either alone or just pulled aside from the rest of the group it’s okay but if your going to say it in front of everyone i think it’s better to just use gender neutral terms or avoid pronouns and just use their name.
a little cause i wish i could pass well
I appreciate  the effort on their end though it’s a lil sad I don’t quite pass
Nope. I’m a pre everything trans guy and i’ve realised that masculine androgynous is the farthest i’ll get without medical transition. People asking my pronouns (esp when they only ask me and know my given name) feels like they see me as Not a girl and it’s mild euphoria
**I hate it**. I've worked very hard to pass and have my gender assumed correctly, which by and large it is. I dislike it so much that I generally avoid any spaces where it is expected. To me, it can't be asked without implying that I don't pass.
I meam yeah but its whatever i can also appreciate it
Yes and no. Yes because it’s always better to ask and it’s very respectful. Bad because I’m not fully passing.
makes me insecure like i don’t pass . wouldn’t ask a grown cis man his pronouns yk? 
but , i guess it’s also like ok well at the very least they can tell i’m probably not cis ? so it’s a foot towards passing
Yes. For fuck's sake, *assume* my gender. lol.
I don’t get asked a lot, so it’s a nice surprise when people care to ask.
The last time Someone asked what our (me and 2 others) pronouns were…the super cute domme then turned to me and asked “so do you like being called a good girl?”

I blushed. 

When done right it’s not offensive.
No I love it, to me it means they're probably an ally or queer themselves. Also I used to want to pass when I was newer to transitioning but now I pass and I miss being visibly trans. My people are the queers and I miss being recognized. So I like when I feel like I'm seen
Im not out so ida Have to say the wrong pronouns:(
no, I am glad people ask, it makes me feel loads better when I know they know
for this particular reason, i’ve started asking everyone i meet for their pronouns

i’m not out enough to take advantage of other people doing the same, but even so it’s the least i can do to not alienate people who are yknow

at the very least, i get good vibes since i know that they at least care and have it on their mind

i would be annoyed if someone singled me out in particular and didn’t ask anyone else in a group (not that i’ve had that happen because again. not out.), but if they do ask other people, or it’s a one on one setting, it would be good to give the benefit of the doubt yknow
No, I’m pleased that the person asking has recognised the need to do so
nah, I view it as a positive thing
There’s no reason to be if it’s out of curiosity.
We don't find that offensive. And we don't take it as a sign of not passing (one of us is enby-ish anyway, so we don't have to *always* pass per se). But of someone starts calling us male words, we presume it's time to educate or beat down said someone 🤣
Yeah bc then I'd know they don't know wtf i am!
I love it. It’s a lot better than being misgendered.
Personally no. The opposite. It shows some genuine sensitivity towards that topic and the will to treat me the correct way...
If you are introducing yourself you can give your name and pronouns, and then they will give their name and if they would like to give you pronouns they have the chance to give them to you at that point.
No not really, but I'm also at the stage where just not getting misgendered is great, so I'm probably not the best one to speak here

I would say that asking pronouns should be standard though, not just done on rare occasion
I would be happy because I appear very feminine because I'm not out to my family yet, but I go by he/him.
I feel amazing when they ask - it means they actually care about not being rude and want to be respectful
Nah. Once I got to the point where I liked my reflection in the mirror I stopped caring about passing or being gendered correctly all the time. If someone asks me my pronouns I answer and thank them for asking. It also leaves me with a higher opinion of that person cause they specifically tried to avoid offending me
No. Being asked means they're trying to be respectful of your wishes and not make assumptions based on their previous experiences.
Why would I get offended, sounds like they would be trying to be nice and respectful.
In English? Nah, no problem.
In Polish it feels weird and a bit wrong, because most of the gendering is done in other ways, but due to the cultural hegemony of the us we're talking about pronouns here as well.
I'd rather be asked my pronouns than be misgendered to be honest.
No makes me happy that someone is taking interest in who I am as a person, and not as a sex identity
no, they are trying to be nice and inclusive.
I'm pretty conflicted. On the one hand, if someone is asking me my pronouns, they definitely just do it to everyone (I still present 100% male) which is a good thing. 

On the other hand it kills me a little bit to have to answer he/him since I'm not out to anybody yet, but that's obviously not the fault of the person asking.
Personally no, but I don't yet pass very well so it might change
Nope, I ask everyones pronouns when talking to them regardless of their appearance or whatever, i think other people do the same as well.
No, I wish everybody would ask!
No. Even though I try to put them in as most places as I can, if I get asked I'll gladly give them.
I personally don’t since I go by all formal pronouns except it but I can see why someone would find it offensive.
yeah, i agree with you...
I know it's not to make me feel bad and i don't scream at them for asking me but i just keep thinking about all the time people had asked me which pronouns i use.
I just wanna blend in with everyone (i don't take it as an offense and i won't hate you for asking, plenty of my friends asked me this question and never got mad at them for doing so) and if someone asks that question every insecurity i have that's related to gender dysphoria pops up
yeah i get it, in trans safe spaces is common practice... but in real life? It sounds kinda fake and almost like a mockery to trans people if some random and ""obviously"" cis person came up to me to introduce themselves by saing their name and their pronouns. (i'm not trying to be rude i just like to ask questions lol)
Also i should specify that i'm not non-binary and i acknowledge that it's a little different for them
oh, i forgot to add that maybe for people who recently discovered being trans this may not be an ""upsetting"" question because they think ""oh, people notice and i can be myself now!"" and i used to be like that too.
But now a lot of time has passed for me since i discovered being trans and i feel like ""oh no, i'm not passing enough, why are people thinking i may be trans?"".
Idk, this question makes me a little sad and kinda tired,  like after all the effort i put to pass has gone wasted
I’m cis and have trans and non-binary friends and family.

I don’t think there is such a thing as an “obviously cis person” (well unless you mean someone who is loudly TERFY). There are lots of people who are trans and pass amazingly well (so could they also be “obviously” cis?), and there are cis people who don’t conform to gender stereotypes and get wrongly clocked. 

Isn’t asking and offering pronouns normalising non-cis het experiences and viewpoints? I don’t get the “in real life” bit. Aren’t trans safe spaces real life? 

I can understand feeling singled out if someone is asking pointedly and doesn’t ask anyone else. But generally isn’t it a good thing if people don’t assume & just offer their & ask others regardless of whether they are cis/trans/NB/fluid?
yeah maybe i worded the ""obviously cis guy"" thing  badly... idk if this happens a lot with other trans people but for example, some days ago i was hanging around with my friends (who are cis and my same gender, so i was the only trans guy) and they stumbled upon another group of friends who clearly don't like the whole ""asking pronouns"" thing, and i think they knew i was trans so they introduced ONLY to me with ""hello i'm *guy name* and i use he him pronouns!"" to mock me and it was very awkward, maybe because I don't wanna be viewed as a trans person...
this is an example of a ""real life"" thing (which i also worded badly sorry lol), i am not openly trans because i pass well enough to stranger and i don't wanna tell people i'm trans cause it's a private thing, and if the people around you are not well aware of the pronouns thing it souns... fake almost when you introduce yourself like the guy did (but also he wasn't a good example cause he was a fucking asshole), you know?
When i was in some openly trans groups i didn't have any issues with this kind of introduction but when it happens like in this occasion i feel like people are moking me
with this said i wasnt trying to be rude, also i can't express myself very well since english is not my first language, so if i offend someone i'm sorry :(
i think it's important to add that i don't live in america or uk and where i live there are no neutral pronouns and if you are not part of the lgbtq comunity no one is gonna introduce themselves like this guy did, so it would be great to hear that in america is different and it's really a usual thing to do👍"	vf2a7j	trans	77	0.94	2022-06-18 09:07:24
Sad week but figuring it out and fighting 💖 ✨The Climb✨		Fat ass booty, I’ll smack that ass 🍑💦	f0eh0n	trans	81	0.97	2020-02-07 18:19:55
I told my wife about my dysphoria and now everything is in the sh!tter.	"I just want to scream and cry. 

I started to see a therapist about my dysphoria at the behest of you fine folks here on Reddit. I'm trying to figure out if these feelings are truly my own or if they're from somewhere else (long story, but my mom wanted a girl but never got one so I want to make sure this isn't the result of her projecting on to me). I told her the reason for me going to therapy because things in our marriage are a little rough and my dysphoria is causing a huge rift. So I finally told her about my dysphoria and what it means.

Big freaking mistake.

I just wanted to be honest with her about what was going on in my head and that things she was blaming herself for were my own problems. Now she can't look at me without a glare of judgement. I've been fighting these feelings for over 20 years. I know that it'll take time for her to come to terms with what I told her but now I'm afraid that she's going to leave me. 

I feel the lowest I've ever felt. I bore my heart to the woman I love and I got met with vitriol. I'm so sad, angry, hurt, and exposed. I don't know what to do."	"I’m so sorry sweetie. Honesty is definitely the right thing to do, and it’s terrible that your partner can’t support you on your journey. It’s never a mistake to talk to your partner about troubles. You deserve to be you. If your partner can’t be there for you, then she’s not a partner. I’m sure this doesn’t really ease the pain, but please don’t give up on yourself. Continue your therapy. Continue your journey.
What I have to say isn't rosy, but it's honest, because I'm dealing with this too. You made the right call telling her, you did your duty as her partner to let her know, you did your duty to yourself by putting your needs on the table for her to pick up or leave. You've hurt her, you feel like it, and she thinks it. It can feel like you've been lying to her for years about who you are, and yeah, kinda. She's fallen in love with the masculine person you pretended to be, either because you didn't know or weren't ready to confront it, and that's going to feel like a huge betrayal. But you know what? You were right to do this. It wasn't wrong to seek love, to fall in love, before you knew yourself 100%, or had confronted everything within you. You did what any human would do, and you're going above and beyond to keep her in your life now. You're doing everything you can, but the ball isn't in your court. She can leave your needs on the table, and it would still be for the better, as much as it kills you. She'd be freeing you, to be who you are and find someone else who will love you for you. Even worst case scenario, you've done the right thing. If she turns vicious and hateful, you need to know this is who she's always been, you've only been fortunate enough to not be on the receiving end until now. It sucks so much, and it feels like the end of everything, but I encourage you to hold on to what's been keeping me going. This is really the beginning, births are painful. You've grasped the key to your own happiness, a happiness that doesn't come from others. You can get there, the journey is worth it.
Well, you had the courage explaining to your wife who you are now. That is,  different than the man you were and she has met in your early relationship. So, big shock also for her. Her reaction is at the level of her fears linked to the discovery of the new situation. You have changed, and were ready to tell her. That is an important step, you did it. It will probably take time for her, also it will take time for you and your relationship. 

I fully understand you want to scream and cry. Go to your therapist, and let all these feelings and emotions go. Finding help and support from other people is also important - and that is what you’re doing sharing with this community.

You mention your wife is judging you, and it hurts. How is she doing that ? My guess is, this is the way to behave she had learned from her parents to deal with a difficult situation, without the ability to put words on it. You might try to encourage her to express how does she feels when she is judging you. And listen to her, without reply, let her some space for expressing her feelings. An then your turn, tell her how you feel, without judgement, asking her not to interrupt you until you’re finished. Avoid replying to her speech, rather express what you feel. That creates kind of space where each of you can express what needs to be, and being listen to without judgment.
Find the right time to do so, when you have some time in front of you.

Whatever the path your relationship will follow, such an approach can help to peace it.
Remember it’s not her fault if she doesn’t want to be with you anymore, but it’s also not your fault you’re trans. Don’t let her mistreat you or stop you. This is your body, your life, and untreated dysphoria is a deadly serious condition she needs to respect.
Ah I feel the “mom wanted a —— but got your instead” my mom wanted a boy first that was a few years older than her second child which she wanted to be a girl (she got 2 AFAB kids) except I’m ftm and I always make jokes about how I’m giving my mom what she wants but it’s hard to tell yourself that’s not what you are actually doing
I've just been through the same with my ex-fiancé. Well done for telling her, it isn't easy, and it isn't easy having the person you trust most in the world with this information throw it back in your face. The decision to come out is going to be forever associated with losing her, one of the worst things that's ever happened to me, but I still know it was the right thing to do. We are still on good terms and I can't see my life without her there at least as a friend, but it feels like I killed half of myself. Hopefully it's to make me more of myself in the long term, but it hurts. So much. Sending hugs, OP, take care out there
I can very much relate as I’m going through the same thing.  Without knowing your wife, all I can say is give it time and continue to be honest.  She’s likely processing everything and this takes time. My wife felt similar, asking if she wasn’t enough for me and even questioning her sexuality for being attracted to me.  At the beginning, I never thought she would accept me, but I’m starting HRT microdosing next week and she fully supports it knowing that it will help me feel better about me, and be good for both of us. 

There will definitely be ups and downs along the way, but continue to show your love and appreciation for her, and she might end up being supportive.
Ask her to go to couples counseling with you.

Thank you, that’s very kind of you to say. I’m pretty sure I am only one of many who’d say the same thing :)"	taohrf	trans	77	0.99	2022-03-10 02:41:13
3 years HRT, from a 36 yo 300lbs sad man to a 40yo slim goth goddess. AMA.	"Hi everyone!

Like a LOT of trans girls, I've become a LOT less active in this sub after my first few years. For me, it was true what they said - Being transgender becomes less of a 'thing' the longer you are in transition. Of course, your mileage may vary (ymmv). 

When I was first transitioning, it was super helpful to be able to ask other trans girls about their process. I'll tell you a little about my story and then list the surgeries and meds I've been on. 

My egg didn't crack until I was 36. It took me about a year of therapy to really come to terms with being transgender. I've always been queer (pansexual), but never really figured out that my sexuality was not actually the root of my 'queerness' but my gender was. I never identified with the whole 'I feel like a woman on the inside' thing. I just felt wrong, constantly. Like a lot of trans girls, my egg cracked because I dressed 'in drag' for a party once and it threw my life into a tailspin. My relationship almost didn't survive, I went through extreme bouts of gender euphoria and dysphoria, depression, anxiety, closing myself off to the world, and so on. If you look in the pictures below, the picture in the top right was me the night before I decided to start HRT. I tried sending a selfie to my partner and couldn't even smile anymore. I felt and looked old and tired. The very next day I contacted a local doctor and made an appointment. I've been on HRT now for 3 years and 1 month. 

While I lost some weight before then, I always struggled to keep it off. I had weird invasive thoughts my whole life like, 'If I were a woman, I would DEFINITELy want to be hot and care about shit like exercise'. At my biggest, I was 300 lbs, pre-diabetic and had high blood pressure. I lost a lot of it by going vegan but I still bottomed out around 220. It wasn't until I transitioned that I hit my goal weight of under 170 (fluctuates by about 3lbs a week from 167 - 170). 

Transitioning socially was a VERY hard process. I came out to my hyper-religious southern family (Jehova's Witness), my partner (now fiancee), her family, my coworkers, etc. I live in a red state that is VERY religious and worked in a predominantly Mormon company and city. I stood out like a sore thumb throughout the entire process. Literally, anywhere I went, people knew who I was. Still, I felt better in my brain than I ever had, which motivated me to get my body right. 

I'm now thin, attractive (by my standards of myself), happy AF, a raging lesbian homo, and not a day goes by that I don't love myself and my life. Sure, I still struggle sometimes, but instead of fighting a tidal wave of misery, I'm just fighting run-of-the-mill 2020 crap (now 2021). Being trans is no longer 'a thing' in my life. I give talks to large tech communities about my experience to educate others. I quit my job and am going to school full-time for something I love vs something I had to do. My struggles are now more 'woman' related than 'trans' related. My family has accepted me with time and while my partner and I broke up twice during my transition, we are now engaged. If there's hope for a 300 lbs Jehova's Witness son of an immigrant raised in poverty, there's hope for you!

Now for some quick facts. 

**Stuff they don't teach you at Trans School**

* Being pretty is awesome, but comes with it's own dangers. Like guys following me in their cars aggressively hitting on me. 
* Gender discrimination is a real thing. My peers started interrupting me more, not taking my word at face value, etc. 
* Dysphoria lessens tremendously, but I still have bad days sometimes. They just aren't 'as bad'. 
* For me, when I fell in love with my body, I became obsessed with self-expression. I have 6 new tattoos and 3 new piercings since beginning my transition. No more geeky t-shirts and jeans for me!
* The confidence, holy cow! I was never a 'confident' person until now. Going through something SO HARD tempers you. 
* Sex is way better....but also more difficult. 
* It's worth it. It's so so so worth it. 
* I didn't really start 'passing' completely until my voice surgery and my hair was out to my shoulders.

**My timeline**

1. 1 year of talk therapy before starting HRT (age 36). 
2. 3 years of HRT (started at age 37). 
3.  5 Surgeries so far that insurance didn't cover (Will be 8 by the time I'm done):
   1. Tummy tuck at age 36 to try and get right with my body in order to NOT transition. Didn't work. About $14,000
   2. Breast augmentation - $7,000
   3. Brazillian Butt Lift #1 - $6,000
   4. Facial Feminization Surgery (FFS) - $38,000
      1. Brow Contour
      2. Chin Implant
      3. Rhinoplasty
      4. Lip lift
      5. Chin Lipo
   5. Vocal Feminization Surgery (VFS) - $7,000-ish

ASK ME LITERALLY ANYTHING. I'll leave this up for a week or so :)

Can i say this gives me hope! im 278ish pounds pre hrt. im out socially. but i was worried id look like a linebacker. im built similar to what you used to look like. thank you so much for posting this!
#Goals

Thank you for posting this. It gives me hope! I had the same look & style as the ‘old you’ 😬 My egg cracked last year (3yrs later than yours!) & I don’t have a spare £50k, but I hope I can still see a fraction of your results.
Thanks for sharing this! I’m in my 30s, too, but ftm (and still figuring out exactly what my gender is but on my way), and it is great to see someone in a similar age range transition so beautifully.  You look great, and I really appreciate reading your story, so thank you for sharing!

I guess I also don’t really relate to the “ive known since I was two” narrative, and I also started getting euphoria after doing drag, and getting more masc haircuts, etc.  And it’s sometimes still hard for me to consider that “valid” - I have a close friend who is a trans man that I haven’t talked to in a while (not for any bad reasons - just life), and honestly it scares me the most to consider talking to him about this because it feels like somehow I’m being rude to him?  I guess that’s imposter syndrome, I don’t know.

Anyway!  Thanks so much for sharing.  I relate to a lot of what you have said, and it eases my mind a little bit to see your journey.  I am still figuring myself out, but I’m leaning heavily in the presenting as a man direction, and seeing your transition is very inspiring!
Those surgery prices are very reasonable by USA standards... what part of the world did you get your surgeries done? Any complications?
Oh you are so beautiful. I’ve just turned 30 and am finally coming to terms with my gender. I was worried it was too late but man you give me hope! How long did it take your hair to grow? Do you have any hacks for making it grow faster? 

Also I love your user name, strong DS9 vibes 🖖
Congratulations on the success of your journey! I’m glad that you’re in a better place emotionally, and mentally 💜💙
Congrats!

If you could pick just one surgery that did the greatest impact alone (as if a person only had the ability to get through one surgery, with cost being irrelevant), which one  would that be?

edit: at what point did you fell in love with your body?
girl just came here to say you look fucking great
Thank you!
No worries! It takes some work, but you'll get to your goals!! I honestly NEVER thought I would pass. Having a good set of friends and support system helped me get through the hard part. You've got this!
Thanks! Yea, my insurance didn't cover anything but from what I understand, a lot of the insurance companies are now covering gender-affirming surgeries which include FFS and breast augmentations. I just happened to work for a Mormon company which meant that no way in hell were they going to pay for an insurance that had anything to do with transgender rights.
No worries!!! All of my trans guy friends had really good results on T. I've noticed that they don't really spend as much time online as my trans girlfriends.
The VFS and FFS I had done in Boston with Dr Spiegel. I can't recommend him enough. Amazing work. The BBL and Breast augmentation as well as the tummy tuck I had done in Salt Lake City. Dr Warnock sees transgender patients and does a pretty good job.
Thank you!!! My hair is only about 6"" past my shoulders naturally. I put in extensions to get me through the next year of growth. Honestly, you just have to take your hormones and tough out the awkward stage. I hated wigs so I never learned how to wear them.
Thanks, doll <3
Oh gosh. That one is a hard one. It was either my face or my voice. While my face had the biggest impact on my self image, my voice had the biggest impact socially. It's not 100% to where I'd like it (especially over video), but IRL no one every clocks me anymore because of my voice. Yea, I just talked myself into it being my voice :) 

Falling in love with my body was a slow process. It took about 2 years on HRT to finally feel like I wasn't in the wrong body, but it wasn't a light switch. First, my brain stopped screaming at me that it was wrong after about 2 months on HRT. Then when my boobs started to come in, I began caring about my body. This drove me to work out more, eat right, etc. I could see in my head the body that I wanted. Then, I started to like my body over time. By the year 2 mark, I had my breast augmentation and then I LOVED my body."	lpy5nr	trans	78	0.96	2021-02-22 19:57:43
My parents keep misgendering me	"I already told them everything, they know how I feel but, is like they're so convinced I'm not serious about it, or that I will forget about it.

Not a single time I heard from them my real name, they just deadname me and misgender me, is like they don't even try. Its been almost a month, a bit more than a month.

I try to say clearly ""No, I'm Pol"" or correct them in general but it feels so unsettling, is like I can't even do it, like I'm not allowed.

I'm so done already, I don't know how to copy with it, how to answer to them, how many times I have to tell them I'm not a girl, they're supposed to support and treat me the right way.

They just think I'm not ""experienced enough"", but WTF who are you to tell me that, about mYSELF. I'm fucking done and exhausted, I have a constant feel of anxiety, fear, regret and sadness, I'm so fucking done."	"My mother does the same thing. Apparently ‘I’m to young to know’. She refuses to use my pronouns and I didn’t bother with my name. I am going to try and ask why I’m to young to know and then give her some evidence to show that trans people find out their gender at really young ages. Maybe you should do a similar thing.
Default dance on them 😎
Do you have any affirming friends who can use your name and pronouns around your parents? That has helped me more than anything else. Also, unfortunately, it may just take some time. I've been out 5 years and my parents can't get my pronouns right, but they've finally started using my name.
Well refer to them as sperm donor and growth habitat see how that makes them feel
There was a meme that keeps popping up here and there, about how a brother/sister solved this problem for their trans sibling by using an airhorn at a family gathering every time the sibling got misgendered/deadnamed.

For a less aggressive and more passive-aggressive approach, ignore anything they tell to 'deadname' and only respond to what they tell to 'Pol' ( I think thats your name? I might have misunderstood your post. ).
I am angry for you even though I have a  sorta  have the support of mother I just got a wait because she had envisioned she was going to do all the girl things with me

Your best bet may be a total reframe. I've had a few parents come to me with concerns about their kids and I always ease them in with ""If you buy them a dress (or boxers and flannels, w,/e) what harm is that really going to do? Maybe they'll figure out it's not really for them but if you fight them on it they're just going to want to do it more, so my advice- let them do the thing."" If you frame it as what makes sense to them- an exploration, it isn't a power play at that point. 

As far as how to cope with them not respecting your pronouns- [gray rock](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201911/the-price-and-payoff-gray-rock-strategy) them and gently correct them when the situation is safe to do so. It's a method that people use to deal with narcissists, but you can apply the technique here as well.
They way I handled it might be a bit hardcore but it worked.  


Whenever someone missgendered or deadnamed me, I didn't react or correct them ( especially when I couldn't just ignore them.)  


If that didn't help, I corrected them with a voice that basically said ""I am serious, do not cross me on this.""   


If that didn't help (only a few times) i slapped them. ""Small Slaps on the Back of the Head are good for your memory "" is  a saying we have in germany so I put it into practise. Only somewhat gently but it made the point.
Welcome to the club pal.
It may seem cruel, but they are your parents. Until you are emancipated or on your own, they have a right to call you by your given name.

You have to pick your battles.
Get an air horn, honk it every time they use the wrong pronouns or name.
that's a great idea!, maybe it could help my situation, thank you for the advice
I'm 25 and my family still struggles with this after 3 years.

Idk why, they are really supportive and hate themselves for doing so, but the simple are to stupid to get my pronouns right 🤷🏼‍♀️😩
So your mother thinks you're too young to know if you're trans but not too young to be cis? 👀👄👀
HAHAH WTF
That's so rough to hear, I'm sorry it's taking so long for you but I'm also really proud you've made it this far at the moment. And yes, I have a lot of people using my pronouns and my name but this holidays were too much for me.
Thank you for this reply, I've never seen the meme but I wish my siblings could do that, and yes, you're totally right my name is Pol ♥️
Also, that was actually something my Mum requestet, I made a Foto with make up and all to hammer home the point and put my Name beneath it.   


Worked so far, now if only they would get the spelling right...Eleanore isn't THAT complicated.
They have no such ""right"".
Wrong! Parents don't get to treat their kids however they want. This is emotional abuse. Fuck that noise!
Happy to help!
Basically. Not sure of the logic behind that though.
Or just whenever they deadname you cut them off by screaming ""POL"" at the top of your lungs. 💀💀
I'm not claiming that it's moral, but they do.
If it's truly abuse, then the authorities need to be notified.
you literally made my day HAHAHAH
If it's not physical the authorities won't do shit.

And honestly, even if it was physical, nine times out of ten the parent denies it, the authorities take them at their word, and the kid is left with the abusive parent.
What even was the point of your comment here? Other than to just bring someone further down than they already were? Cmon.
Blast cbt videos through a massive bluetooth speaker during an extended family gathering 💀💀💀💀
Looking at the account, they’re a troll. So yes, it was just to hurt people.
Because being lgbtq and homeless (as a minor) is a pretty dismal combination.
But that isn't a problem right now. You are bringing nothing constructive at all to this situation. Think!"	rzw6ox	trans	76	0.94	2022-01-09 17:08:28
"The ""Ma'am"" Problem"	"I just came off three straight days of dealing with a Twitter mob that told me repeatedly that it's selfish, harmful, entitled, and *schizophrenic* to want strangers to not assume my gender, and use nongendered terms or pronouns (like they/them) to refer to me until they've had a chance to ask what my pronouns are. 

I've heard everything from ""there are only two genders, duh"" to ""it's misgendering to call me they/them, just assume my gender and call me she/her so you don't trigger my dysphoria.""

So... earlier today, at the grocery store, I was addressed as ""ma'am."" I present rather masc, but I have a voice that gives me away every time. In spite of the multiple they/them pins and patches I wear, I'm misgendered rather frequently. Some days I don't care. Today, it just made me feel icky. 

But I also feel guilty for reacting negatively to the misgendering. I think I've started to internalize some of the transphobic rhetoric around how overly sensitive we are as a group, and how I'm just ""acting the victim"" when I want people to not assume they can tell my gender by the sound of my voice. 

I'm tired. Worn down. Sad. And at the moment, rather dysphoric. I don't know what to do, or if I'm even allowed to feel the way I feel."	"You're not alone. I feel the same way. I'm like you--dress and present masc but my voice and other features out me as afab and get me read as female. Just last night I was so happy no one used gendered language toward me at a get together my friend arranged with people I hadn't met before. I thought about disclosing my pronouns from the beginning but I was exhausted after a long day of dealing with transphobia at work so I didn't feel like coming out to new people. But then someone started using she/her about me during a game we were playing near the end of the gathering and it sucked. It just sucks to be reminded of the fact I don't pass day in and day out. It's exhausting to have my gender constantly dictated by strangers  no matter how I present. I just wish people would use neutral language. It can be tricky sometimes-- I slip up at it myself-- but I feel like it's something we should be striving toward in a more trans-aware world.
I feel you, it’s exhausting to correct people constantly. If society could stop assuming and categorizing everyone in one of two boxes based on arbitrary standards that’d be nice. Unfortunately I don’t see that changing any time soon, so I just try my best to find ways to cope.

This is one of the reasons why I want hrt so badly. At least being assumed opposite of my agab wouldn’t feel as bad to me.
It’s certainly valid to feel the way you feel because you are feeling it, people just haven’t personally experienced the feeling so think it should be no gig deal since a privilege of being cis is you rarely get misgendered and song experience dysphoria if you do.

I will say it feels very personal since it hurts like daggers and conversely the euphoria from being properly gendered is amazing at first.  However, now that I’m used to it I can say people don’t even think about it.  It’s literally subconscious.  Obviously some people take the conscious effort to think about, but for most people it’s just automatic.  So, don’t taken it as intentional most times.  Secondly, it does get better both in terms of avoiding misgendering and the resulting dysphoria.
You're allowed to feel these feelings you're feeling. It's not just you. I work at a store, and when people think they're being polite, calling me ""ma'am"", it's not, and it makes me feel dysphoric too. It's hard. I get it. Hang in there... <3
It’s not your fault for being misgendered. Empty vessels make the most noise, which is why transphobes are so loud. Maybe to them sensitivity is asking for common courtesy. Looking at the number of deaths by men per year out of pure stubbornness, it seems like they do think that way. But they clearly aren’t correct.
You're definitely in the right here. Assuming someone's gender is asinine.
I’m so tired of feeling like asserting my personhood in any way, no matter how small, is seen as trying to be a victim. I’m not trying to my make my trans status a big deal (or any kind of deal at all) I just want to not be harassed…. Hang in there, friend
I've briefly considered HRT myself, but I like my singing voice too much to want it to change. *sigh* Can't have the cake and eat it too."	t2e9hd	trans	75	0.97	2022-02-27 02:59:46
I ran away from home in October. I am now an emotional wreck.	"I guess I just need to hear encouragement and advice from people who may have gone through similar things. I’m a trans man, pre-T and I turned 18 earlier this year. I had been outed to my mother, who in turn outed me to my father. He said that me believing I was bisexual and trans was a perversion and even compared my “sin” to being a pedophile. They later told my sister that I was possessed by a demon. Due to a heavy mixture of general and religious trauma, anxiety, emotional abuse from my parents and encouragement from my friends, I made the decision to leave my home a few months ago at the time of me writing this. The only person in my family who knew I was leaving was my sister.

I was only able to mail a few boxes worth of personal items to my new home, and carry a few bags worth of clothes with me. My parents tried to reach me many times during my journey, to the point where my sister had to text my girlfriend to reach me, and I can tell I had hurt them badly. They begged me to come back home so I could discuss this with them like an adult, and so that they could get one last hug from me. Of course, I didn’t go. This was a heavy talking point when I had to call them a few days after I’d arrived in my new home- and I only did that because they had been giving out my phone number and email to family members and were threatening to send out a missing person’s report if I didn’t speak to them. Now, between a phone, I felt safe enough to tell them that I would be legally changing my name as soon as possible. My dad… didn’t like that. I know I’ll have to have another talk like this eventually.

It hurts me to talk to them, but it hurts me even more to think I’ll never see them again. I miss my mother terribly. My older brother has only just now started to speak to me again, and my sister and I have only exchanged texts a few times since everything happened. I don’t talk to my dad at all if I can help it. I don’t know how to ask for them to address me as their son and their brother. I’ve been getting nightmares at night and I don’t sleep well anymore. I don’t really know what I can do to move forward with them- or if I ever can. I didn’t want to have to be the first out queer person in my family, and while I know I had to leave for my own safety, my mental health has just been absolutely destroyed. Whenever I think about them or I have to talk to them, I feel anxious, scared, and very sad. I cry often. I get depressed and homesick and I miss my old room. I don’t know what to do anymore and I wish my adult life didn’t have to start out like this"	"Oh, boy. First off, I'm sorry shit escalated to this level. Second off, a relative considering you a pedophile? That's my jurisdiction, *hello.* I do wanna say that I'm sorry for whatever you had to deal with - while my family *threatened* to send me to an exorcist, the threat was never fully realized, and to pretend otherwise would be both inconsiderate and ignorant of me. I do wanna say, however, that regardless of how drunk I am(very) it seems inconsiderate to acknowledge the difficulties you've gone through.

I'm sorry about your nightmares, I truly am. I think, though this is only one person's opinion, that it's absolutely normal to have nightmares after everything you've been through. The same goes for crying, and feeling anxiety. Life is tough, without everything you're going through, and expressing emotions however you will(through tears, anger, apathy, violence) is perfectly natural.
I admire your strength to have run away from the abuse. That is incredebly hard, you have every right to be emotionally drained after such an ordeal.  
It‘s natural that all of your thoughts are filled with your family rn, but if I can give advice that helped me heal- concentrate on yourself for a while.  Not the past, but the future. Like, do you want to start college soon? Or work a job that interests you? Wanna do anything to your current room to make it more comfortable? Took me a (too) long time to fully realize the amount of things I could *do*, instead of just accepting things that happen *to me*.  
It‘s going to get better, but it‘s a slow process. Any contact with your family is hard rn, but it‘s going to get easier.
I applaud your strength and willingness to walk away. The next step is to keep moving forward. 

Are you seeking therapy or counseling? I would reach out to people who do support you and let them know how you're doing. If money/insurance is a concern check local transgender groups who might know therapist who have pro bono or reduced rates for the uninsured.

You just had a massive shack up of your emotional support base and are feeling a lot vulnerabilities. Find the people who will move forward with you before worrying too much about how to drag the people you left out of their hole. 

Guilty is a powerful tool of manipulation don't let them tie you up with it. They wouldn't say such hurtful things if they truly wanted to help you. Find the people who will help you, the authentic ""You"", the ""You"" you know you should be. They can't understand the struggles you've gone through, the mental agony. To them it feels sudden and impulsive, they aren't trying to relate to you or understand you. Time might help them but first you must help yourself because they are only interested in helping themselves.
Using the fkn police to lure you back home so they can ""convert"" you? Disgusting. They are toxic to your mental health and physical safety. You may have to also cut your sister out of your life to prevent her from sharing your cell # with the parents.

Your parents are using psychological torture directly and vus your extended family. Damn I feel for you
hey man, first of all i'm proud of you for doing this. with the shit they told you cutting contact seems like the right course of action. i'm very sorry that things are still hard, it's completely understandable after what you've gone through. i've gone through something similar and i'll just share my experience with bits of advice.

i ran away from my folks in july. we've had a rocky relationship forever. i've been living with other people for about half a year at that point but due to financial reasons i was moving back in with my parents. i thought my relationship with my mom had improved since last i lived there but the shit they said to me on the first day i came back made me snap. ran away without even putting on fucking shoes. but it had to be done. i know that had i not run away i would've thrown myself out a window soon, taking that abuse from my parents would have killed me. that's why i'm proud you put yourself first in your situation. i implore you to remember that you didn't run away from your parents to ""hurt them"", you escaped a situation that was dangerous for you mental and physical health.


after a scary but mercifully brief period of homelessness i managed to move in my new place. but as soon as i could finally relax in this new apartment i fell the fuck apart. like the worst depression pit i've ever experienced. destroyed sleep schedule, nightmares about my father and no hope for better days in sight. it really shook me to realize that the people that put me on this earth without my consent, the people that are supposedly the ones who should help and protect me more than anyone else in the world would be so focused on their own comfort and ideas about how things ""should be"" that they would drive their child to suicide. i felt very alone and hurt. (and seeing how homeless people are treated firsthand left me with a fair bit of resentment towards people at large.) i'm still not sure how exactly i'm not in that awful pit anymore but i guess the few friends i have managed to keep me afloat long enough for me to start wanting to live again. you've been separated from the people that should have been your biggest supporters and protectors, it's not something anyone can just brush off. what helped me was seeing that other people care about me and will do things to help me. keeping friendships alive through this period is tricky however, remember that the better you communicate, the bigger the chance that your friendships will grow stronger and healthier. it's gonna be hard but a found family of people that truly love you is so worth it, people can overcome so much when they can rely on each other.

you said that you get homesick and miss your family. it's completely understandable, something has been ripped from your heart. you need to properly grieve the loss of that and be able to put it behind you. i'm no therapist so i can't be more helpful here, but looking into getting professional mental help is definitely something worth a look. therapy is stupid expensive for how vital it is for people, but a good professional can help you make sense of your feelings and help you work through traumas that keep you down. lgbtq+ orgs near you might have some counseling options, or at least contacts of specialists who are queer-friendly, there's probably other options too.

keep fighting. keep your friends close. remember that there are good people out there, it just might take a while to get to them. i hope this helped <3
I've been there, and I want you to know that it's going to get better from here. It's going to feel raw for awhile but try your best to push through. There are people out there who will love and support all of you, but you have to keep pushing forward.

 I still have a hard time sleeping regularly, but my nightmares are far less frequent than when I left. Try to find a therapist that specializes in traumatic experiences. They'll help you learn to cope with your past and move on. You also may qualify for some financial assistance from the government. These programs can help a lot if you do qualify. 

Hang in there man. I know it's all scary right now, but you're on the right path. I believe in you!
I would recommend therapy and if that doesn't help get a psychiatrist to prescribe prazosin off-label( its what helped treat my flashback nightmares that I get from having C-PTSD). 
I'm sorry you have to go through all of this. But family is the people that actually care about you and when your blood relations don't sometimes you end up having to make your own family out of friends.
my advice is to talk with them.  Raise your vibration before you do.  Remember not to let fear rule your life.  My daughter (17) to get out of the house went to drastic measures.  She ran to CPS and the police and accused her father and I of horrid abuse because she didn't like living with us anymore.  Now, for the 4th time we have CPS up our butt hole and my husband has a pending battery charge against him.  No abuse was ever done to her.  She likes to use the system for ""punishing us"" for us being too controlling.  The best advice I can give to you is that your family loves you.  They may not understand and may not ever understand what you are going through but they love you just the same.  If you are living your life authentically you have nothing to fear or be ashamed of.  Coming from a mother's veiw....anytime she blocked me from the truth or hid anything from me robbed me of truly knowing my daughter.  She didn't let me see her or get to know her by either lying, avoiding or omitting.  I would rather her have spoken her truth authentically than be avoided and lied to.  Your family misses you and they're probably worried.  Give someone a call and just let them know that your ok and tell them how you feel.  Keep it light.  Life is supposed to ebb and flow with all of the situations and all the emotions.  There's a reason why we have to go through something.  You can't go over, under or around...only through to the other side.  Only then are we wiser.    Much love.  I'll be thinking about you.
The violence option seems more appealing every day.

Seriously though, it all feels so… abrupt. I was supposed to have been in college by now. Now I’m thousands of miles away from my family and I’m living in a place where people use the right name for me, but the quality of life overall is so astronomically different. I don’t know when I’ll feel like I’m ‘home’ again. I don’t even know if getting my own place is going to fix it. It really hurts
Right now my plans are to stay put and work. In about a year I’ll be able to afford my own apartment, and my girlfriend and I have been talking about moving in together after she’s done with college. I want to get a car and I’d like to be able to own a cat. Perhaps someday I can think about going back to college to pursue a degree in Graphic Design, but for now I’ll just continue to work on my silly animatics in the meantime. And of course, as soon as I can start working, I’m going to look into starting HRT

I’m trying to look forward to the future. I just know it’ll be a long time before I can move past everything that happened to me in the last year
I just wanted to let you know I think about this reply a lot. And I'm trying. God I'm trying
You might never feel like you're home again. Uh, again, sorry for my bluntness, but yeah! Sometimes you have to choose between being physically ""comfortable"" or choosing to be around people who respect you as you are, using the right pronouns for you and shit. There are probably going to be situations where you have to choose between being respected as a human being and having a comfortable place to sleep(and, of course, everyone would choose something different - neither option is necessarily bad, I'm just pointing out you might not have both).

I *am* sorry you were forced into this sorta situation, though. I know it's not great - I've had to choose between the people who raised me and being fed the next day. It's not great, but I bet you'll get out of it.
Hsjqhsjajhsj maybe not the *best* choice of words but I get what you mean. I’m doing what I can. I know that’s really all I can do right now.
Hey i know i came out of nowhere, but i just wanted to say thank you for the advice cuz your advice applies to my situation too. So thank you
I’m a trans girl who moved 3000 miles from where I grew up to live as myself. And even after that it took me almost 3 years to work past the trauma, fear and shame to finally be out as myself and start 2022 as me.

It’s hard. But it does get better. Home is where your heart is. My heart is here, with me, my partner, my friend group, my chosen family.

I’m 10 years older than you, and I can tell you for a fact, it can and will get better but only if you take care of yourself. 

You made the right choice. You deserve and NEED to be respected. My family is crazy and religious and my father (the only non-religious person in the family) is the only person I talk to. It hurt for a long time but….

Trans people get a unique chance to REALLY see people. Their true selves, as twisted, hateful, fearful as that might be. This hurts us sometimes, but I’m grateful for it too. When I presented straight Christian male, I could see how fake everything and everyone was. Trapped by illusions and falsehoods, propaganda and they wanna say WE are the delusional ones??? Fuck I’m glad I am 3000 miles away from that conservative dumpster fire.

It’s hard now bro, but it gets better. My messages are open if you ever need advice.
3000 miles is 4828.03 km

The Trans Rollercoaster	"Don't you get that feeling? Like one day everything is so perfect and euphoric, but then, the next day you stare into the void and just want to give up?

I have, a lot of times, and damn, is not good.

I've tried a lot of things to feel better, but the closet is too small to do anything, and still, the idea of ""I feel good, so, everything will be OK if I just come out"" makes me feel secure, but then you peak a little and the things you hear and see are so wrong that you fear for your life?

Why is it so wrong? Why is everyone so mad? Isn't supposed to be my life? 

You know, I know, we know.

This is hard, this is truly the hardest step in our life.

I just want to tell you that you are not alone. That I'm proud of you because I know how this feels. I don't care if you don't want to transition, or if you have doubts about to start your process, even if you are fully happy with your transition. 

I really don't care, because you're a human, just like me.

And as a little human in this huge world we call home, even if we are miles or continents away, I love you, and I want to hug you until we both cry, because you need it, because I need it, because we need each other. 

I understand that this ride is terrifying, but there is no reason to close our eyes and not enjoy the emotions it brings. Even if they make us feel happy, sad or even angry. 

Remember, 

I am here for you, 

We have each other.

And together, we stand and survive. 🏳️‍⚧️"	"I needed this ❤️
This has to be one of the best things I’ve ever read and I desperately needed it. Well, I wasn’t planning on crying but here I am. Thank you for the beautiful thing this is 💕
Oh gosh yes I feel that. I started today crying, then later I felt so good about everything, and then at night I was back to crying again. I'm relatively early in transition I guess, hormones are definitely acting up, and it's been the hardest thing I've ever done. I want to hug you and cry too. Because without even saying anything, we're going through the same things.
Yes
Thanks. Yeah, this happens a lot
Well, that was inspiring. Thank you.
EXACTLY!! Some days are “Wooo yes best boy life! “ and others “well another day of getting from morning to night…somehow…”

Thank you ❤️‍🩹🙏
Thanks, I needed this too. Last few weeks have been tough all around, and it finally caught up to me this week. Two day long anxiety attack and my first real crying fit after 6 months of E. Some small part of my brain wanted to blame me being trans as adding one more layer of difficulty to life. Rollercoaster is exactly how I'd describe it. Better now thanks to support from my loved ones. Stick together guys gals and nb pals, we're in this together.

I cut my hair! (FTM)	I'm so excited right now! I've always wanted to cut my hair, but never really was 'allowed' to. When I was 5 years old, I even tried to cut it with small children's scissors (didn't work unfortunately). A few months ago I hid all my hair under a hat while I was on the bus to school. I was so sad that I couldn't bring myself to do it, but today I finally did it and it feels great. I was on the same bus on the way home, but this time I couldn't stop smiling. After trying to cut my hair for 14 years, I was finally able to do it.	"Congrats hun!! Reminds me of the time I shaved my body hehe 😊 I'm trying to grow out my hair so I don't have to wear wigs anymore but I lost alot of it due to stress but luckily I'm now on stuff to help get my hair back
Happy to hear this ☺️ Enjoy less maintenance haha. I miss short hair for that one reason 😂
I'm so happy  for you, I know something as simple as that can be hard to do, I hope you enjoy it
Oh no thats sounds horrible, but I'm happy to hear that you already found something that will help. I wish you the best of luck🥰
Thank you!😊 I had a lot of curly hair, my head is so much lighter now I love it :3
Thanks my dermatologist was super supportive because I told him I'm a closeted trans woman and I actually got emotional he patted me on the back and comforted me saying that I deserve to be who I am and shouldnt have to compromise and that this was hard on me and he would help hehe its always nice when someone supports you ya know hehe
Thats a really lovely dermatologist! And yeah being supported always feels amazing and he is right with everything he said :3 Never give up and be who you are. You deserve it.
Same to you hun hehe 😊 we both are beautiful people that deserve to be happy and loved 😁
Thank you😊
Ur welcome 😁"	u6rhoa	trans	74	0.98	2022-04-19 00:06:34
"Thoughts evolving from ""I'm a boy who wants to be a girl"" to ""I'm a girl trapped in a boy's body"""	"Hey everyone, I have a random thought/question. My egg cracked two months ago, and I realized I might be trans, but it didn't hit me immediately what that fully meant.

&#x200B;

I still thought of myself as a boy who wanted to maybe be a girl, and I wasn't comfortable with the idea of she/her and presenting fem. Over those two months I came out to most of my friends, switched my pronouns to they/them, and tried little things like letting my nails grow.

At first it felt like euphoria at the idea that I can actually be a girl and have a girl's body/present as a girl, but I wasn't sad about being in a boy's body yet. But over the course of these past two months my mindset started to shift, and this past week I got hit hard with my first real actual dysphoria. I am envious of literally every girl I see and wish I could look and act like them. The people on the subreddit's Discord have been awesome, and I tried a new name and she/her pronouns on the subreddit. I thought I would feel like a roleplayer, but I don't - I feel genuine. Being called he/him is something that I've gone from indifferent about to something that actually bothers me. A couple nights ago I tried some fem poses in the mirror, something I had previously felt uncomfortable about. One pose looked especially fem, and then I added a FaceApp female filter to it... And I freaked out when I looked like I could pass for cis. I couldn't believe, however, that that was me. And that's when I feel it really hit me - I might actually be a hecking girl, I may have just been a girl this whole time, and I'm stuck in this boy body and I've been forcing myself to present this way my whole life. I feel both insanely liberated and beyond trapped right now and my dysphoria has been off the charts. My parents are unsupported of me transitioning and my next therapy appointment with my gender therapist is a full month away. I'm spending the next week at home with my parents home from college and I'm going to have to boymode 100%, no exceptions. I feel like, for the first time in my life, I'm going to have to fake it, even though I've done this a thousands times before. But its because since everyone else saw me as a guy, I saw myself as one too and until now I never let myself see who I really was on the inside, and now that it hit me I don't want to go back."	"Hell yeah sister! As someone who also came out a couple months ago I'm literally going through the exact same thing 😂
I'm not as far along as you are, but I've definitely been reconceptualizing myself as a lass internally and it's grown quite comfortable fairly quickly. Haven't done as much outward experimentation besides wearing a skirt in private and such, but when I see my masked reflection, I see a girl. Kind of a cute girl when she takes care of her hair and my heart flutters a little as if some part of me that's been invisible and quiet is happily validated. 

I'm very much closeted, but I'm guessing I'll get there as well with body dysphoria. Shoulders and legs already bother me but I'm sure as soon as I find some very affirming looks it's going to be both validating, and make more aware when I'm ""boymoding"" which is currently most of the time though I'm perceived androgynously much of the time anyway.
Yesssss girl I'm so happy for you! I've been going through the exact same shit but god it feels good to finally know yourself. I know it's tough but try not to worry too much about your parents, the people in your life who are worth sticking around will stick around. You only get to discover you're trans once right so have fun and make the most of it!
Congrats sis!
It’s nice knowing I’m not alone in this…. I honestly didn’t realize just how much I wanted to be a girl and how much I repressed it, and now I feel like I’m having a mental explosion.

Just a wig sadly		"Lovely eye color! And that wig looks great on you!
I couldn't tell. You look very beautiful! 💖💖💖💋💋💋
Really good color, it compliments your eyes!
You look incredible beautiful feminine 😍
Still so cute and it's an amazing wig. Where did you get it??
Hey gorgeous-

Just wanted to drop my two cents in here. Needing to wear a wig used to bother me hugely. Don't get me wrong I'm trying for hair transplants, and one day I can hopefully go without, but recently I've figured out that tons of cisgendered women wear wigs. I work near a bunch of high end fashion bourgeois stores and literally, literally one out of every three or four cisgendered women I meet wear an outright wig, have elaborate weave, clip on, extensions, etc.

A lot of the women in my life have been helping me figure this out and feel empowered by it. The wigs don't often pass as real hair, but fuck it. I own it and they look cute as hell.

That wig is bomb, your eyeliner is on point, and your eyes are stunningly blue. Try not to judge yourself too much. Plenty of people are going to do that for you. Enjoy the becoming.
Absolutely gorgeous x
Thank you so much 😊!! The eyeliner is a bit bad haha and the one lash is missing because it fell off on the way to the bathroom 🙈
Its actually a really cheap one, but somehow it works for taking photos :) the online shop is called ""lightinthebox""
Thank you so much kind stranger 😍☺️ that makes me actually a bit more comfortable!
Well you’re still gorg, hope you have a great day. If u ever wanna chat my dms are open."	o69ax1	trans	74	0.97	2021-06-23 09:23:12
I need a hug and ideally some reassurance that I'm not a fetishist.	I don't know why but my most recent post on r/mtf got flooded with hate and transphobia. Normally I can take this stuff in stride and don't let it bother me but this time was different. I feel gross, delusional, a fetishistic freak. I'm just so sad and don't have anyone to talk to	"_hugs_ It it was the post about your dream, I'm so sorry that people reacted that way. I can totally understand what that would be so horrible. ❤️
Why do you feel like you need reassurance that you're not a fetishist? Far as I can tell, your post in question was just a standard infertility dream that many infertile women have. Idk if there's something else prompting this or what but from what I can tell you seem perfectly normal to me.
You have a whole community you can talk to hun, we are here for you. Great big hugs you keep on making wonderful progress being the person you are
Holy crap, you got backlash for that?    Oh girl, I wanted to give you a hug so bad after reading that, I’m so sorry you had to go trough that trauma then get hate for it.   People suck sometimes, but you are allowed to feel.
Pregnancy and childbirth aren’t sexual. You had a horrible nightmare and I’m sorry people are trying to make you feel shit about it.
Literally just fk those people. I’m so sorry, we should be safe in these communities.❤️
Social distance Hugs to you my friend
You're not a fetishist.  If you actually want to be a woman, it's never a fetish.  Anyone can try to CMV on that.
What in the goddamn are those people on about 🤨 That sounds like a totally normal way to process being dysphoric about not being able to get pregnant. Pregnancy anxiety dreams are super common for almost anyone who’s ever considered it, regardless of what direction it’s scary in!
Remember that dreams are your brain working out conflicts. You're not really supposed to remember them at all you really only do so when you happen to wake up before it's over. There are absolutely cis women who dream of having a child. There are cis women who can't have a child for whom a dream like that would feel bad. No rando on the Internet has any idea about your feelings, they are just being assholes and attacking when you are feeling vulnerable (because they are bullies). It's not fetishizing womanhood to say you want to have a baby. That's a thing that people want. If anything, it's a strong indication that you have real feelings about your identity. Outside of that, women, any woman can have thoughts about herself and her body. That's not fetishizing yourself, that is connecting with yourself and understanding your feelings. Some amount of that is just not being uptight and understanding you are a person with feelings and desires and that's ok.

\*HUG\*
hey, it will be ok and you can alwase talk to me. people can be stupid and they fear the unkown but there are also good people out there and you just need to find them.
\*Hug\* You aren't a fetishist.
Hey, you’re not a fetishist. They’ll say anything to hurt us, make us feel bad, you shouldn’t get gross for being you. Transphobes are assholes and anyone here would tell you that.
Virtual hug, idk why they treated you like that in your last post  you're fine and not a fetishist
*Gives hug* Being yourself and what makes you happy is never fetishization, it's being you

Fuck those peoole
You didn’t deserve that youre wonderful some people just don’t understand and lash out at what they don’t understand
I guess when you have enough people in your inbox telling you that your dream is ""a fetishized vision of what it means to be a woman"" you start to wonder if that's what it really is
Also, I will reiterate this. They attack when you are vulnerable. I get almost ZERO hate on here because I don't open up. I am not saying don't open up, but know that that is when they will come out and attack because all they want is to make you feel bad. Also, everyone please report that when you see it, the mods are not omniscient. If it's in DM, send a note to the mods to ban those people from the sub.
People on the internet can be very strange with how they choose to spend their time. I'm operating under the assumption you weren't getting off on your dream and instead experienced it as a nightmare like any infertile woman would. If that's the case, I don't think you should be concerned about anything regarding people bothering you about your dream post. Those people are likely just too online, if you know what I mean.
🧹♻️🗑️🚮

How do you send a note to the mods?
On the sidebar above the moderators names there should be a button that says message the mods this is for browser. Let me check mobile app and see if there's similar.

Ok on mobile you have to go to the about tab in the sub. There is a little envelop above the mods names, that will send them mod mail.

i love my hair. i'm glad i didn't sell it for 300€ like i briefly considered a few years ago
thanks. i try my best

Those are always the worst feelings. Just keep on doing what you're doing, you never know who will come along and fill your life with warm nights 😁
Confused as to why you’re on this subreddit if all you’re going to do is make rude comments on multiple posts... maybe you’re struggling with some internalized cissexism. Can’t think of any other reason for why you would intentionally search for this subreddit and then scroll on it as well.
i went shopping with my almost expired mastercard. i feel a bit better now
I think they've moved on from their little abuse spree into the subreddit, for now. I just feel bad for the amazing people who felt good and had the courage to share themselves with us, and this loser had to come and ruin things."	mg2tm5	trans	70	0.96	2021-03-29 23:44:34
Did I do something wrong in here?	I feel like I look for support and answers in this group just to be ignored or put down a lot…is it something I said? Do the moderators dislike me so they put me at the bottom of the list? Idk..but it’s sad, I want validation just as much as the next person..this is a tough life and you’d think there’d be love in the same community you know?	"Don't seek validation from fickle online communities would be my advice. It can go badly and impact your mental health.
Mods would never do that, and no one here is dedicated enough to cause an entire sub not to interact with you just because of one thing you said. 

Whatever it is, it's not your fault.
I think part of it is your attitude tbh. I understand that it's a hard part of your life but in a lot of your posts you're just dragging yourself down, insulting yourself, etc, and it can be hard to respond to that because we don't agree with it but don't want to be argumentative by saying you're wrong.

That's at least how I felt scrolling back through your posts.
Anything in particular you’re looking for help for? Happy to help you find answers in a constructive way.
I don't think the mods would do things like that, but even if they did, don't base your worth off of upvotes. I'm sure there's a reason aside from that, like the Reddit algorithm.
[deleted]
Same honestly, I have made several posts that just get no replies. Like, looking for advice posts. No idea what's going on here.
I just took a look through your profile to see what posts you could be talking about (I'm a casual post skimmer so i could definitely have missed it) and honestly a lot of your posts seem so self-depreciating. I personally wouldnt comment on most of them because I don't have the spoons or the training in helpful ways to interact with someone going through something.

I'm 34 and just started medically transitioning last October- over the years ive found I can do more harm than good to myself or others by interactin when I have no right doing so. I've had similar self-destructive thoughts, and therapy has been my biggest ally along with reaching out to my chosen family in person and online.

Reddit is full of folks with different reasons for being here, and while they can offer some support that youre not alone, I'm not all that sure that's what youre looking for. Asking if you pass or not is asking for the personal opinions of others, but if you don't meet your own standards, no one here is going to convince you otherwise. Even if they gas you up and compliment the hell outta you.

That's why the very best support I can give to you as a fellow trans person is to tell you to consider counseling. Until the narritive in your head changes, until a tool is gained to move past societal ideals of passing and focus on your own idea of who you are and how you want to express it... No amount of comments to match the views on your posts will change anything. Relying on others to feed your need for self-acceptance is counter-productive.

I wish you the best.
Hi sweetie…i don’t exactly have an answer im sorry you feel left out, you didnt do anything wrong. You are just as valid as any of us, and you are beautiful and loved.
looking through your post history, I can only see 2 other posts in this sub, one of which is removed. I’m sure nobody is actively trying to get your posts avoided or something, but it’s an online community and that’s just how it is sometimes. don’t base your self worth off of upvotes as you’ll quickly lose that game
I try very hard to give honest feedback where it is requested so while I don't know why you don't get the response your looking for, I can tell you I have been trying to respond to you for like 15 mins and I am having a very hard time. I scrolled through your post history and it basically triggered every aspect of dysphoria I have ever dealt with myself. Facial hair, body hair, muscles, hard angles and overt sexuality. 

When you go all in, you look gorgeous, but you post a lot of pictures that make it look like your not trying and that can trigger a visceral negative reaction in a lot of trans women. I would try pulling back on the visual and try explaining your feelings in text. People will respond more to an honest plea for advice or even just a vent post than to a random photo of the day.
It could be that there’s just an overwhelming number of posts and yours are getting lost? I’m completely new to Reddit and have kinda been feeling the same way…
If you seek validation on the internet, especially reddit, you're going to be sorely disappointed.
Honestly I’m done with some of the comments in this post. Because they’re honestly not helping.

I tried to ask for advice about being fat and packing, and I get like, maybe 5 upvotes. There were also two comments, both of them having the gist of “idk sorry what to tell you :/“

I’m pretty sure you’ve done nothing wrong, it might just be audience this subreddit attracts. I hate to say it, but just because we’re all trans doesn’t mean we’re all nice and supportive.

Also I dare anyone to come at me about this, you’re fatph0bic if you do
You are imagining things
This is not a mod issue. This is an algorithm issue. The algorithm is fickle and it doesn't emphasize people with low karma. Hot is the default and not a ton of people sort by new. Have you tried using r/translater? I generally get better reception there instead of this subreddit because I am in my mid 30s.
You probably just have low Reddit karma, the more you interact with Reddit the more Reddit deems your posts worth putting up top. It’s kinda dumb but that’s just how it is ig.
But..it’s a community for just that..I see other posts get tons of attention, I guess I’m just trying to find out why I get so little..hate to be that person..I just don’t get any irl so it’s kind of my only place I know of where people aren’t asking to shove their cocks down my throat. I just want to feel pretty not like a sex object
I’m just trying to find the cause to why one person may ask the same personal question like “passing” and they’ll get 100’s of responses, but whenever I ask I get 100’s of views with no responses. I hate to sound whiney but…it’s upsetting. 🤷🏽‍♀️
I agree if it wasn’t for these kind people’s help ( the 
Mods, as you say ) I wouldn’t even be on Reddit!
Well..I mean, I can’t argue with that. But life is difficult you know? I thought this group was a place for transitioning people to help other transitioning people
I guess it’s just what the post says. What’s up with this group? Why is there so little support in most cases. I might post a “am I passing” post and get little response while someone else can post the same and receive 100’s of responses.
It’s more or less the responses in comparison to the views.
I really wish they wouldn’t have added that feature to see how many people look at your post
I will look into this. I don’t have a twitter or discord yet
Not that I’m happy you’re getting pushed to the side too but I am glad I’m not imagining things
It’s hard to love myself..even when I do, it’s fleeting. I go to counseling, I work out, I’m pretty much healthy. I have a lot of body dysphoria because I get called he pronouns even when I have a she pronouns button right on my face mask. I just paid $3000 for laser just for my facial hair to seem worse than it did before. I mean, there’s all these things and tbh..just being complimented in my own community makes me feel better about myself. Of course it won’t fix anything but it’s a boost of confidence. I don’t want people to lie to me though if I’m ugly so I just assume that the lack of response is just that
It’s ok, I appreciate your comfort! It’s been difficult lately and I guess I’m just having a hard time despite all my annoying selfies and posts..
Yeah..you’re right. Idk why I decided to post this. I’ve had more in this group than the 2, some deleted others just disappear. But it’s not a big deal..I just wanted to feel pretty and that stupid of me as a person cause clearly I am not..
I guess it’s just..I want to look as natural as possible and as a working single full time parent I don’t have much time to go all out all the time. I had to get a night job so I can handle all my appointments, handling my sons appointments because he has cerebral palsy, my counseling, taking care of the house, mowing the yard, bills, self care, cooking, laundry, etc and it just gets tough to mix in “perfect” but somedays I feel pretty and sexy or ugly and insecure other days. I come on here to ask questions but I see so many women get so many compliments which makes me sad because I don’t really receive much of that. The sexual part is taking over because the only people that compliment me most of the time are just sexualizing me(so I figure I should try to make money from that seeing as I’m in debt from the little I’ve transitioned)
Sorry, I could go on and on and on…I constantly feel my dysphoria even when I feel attractive because I’m quickly reminded on here that I’m only worth a quick look
Isn’t that what this group is about is supporting your fellow transgender?
[removed]
Yeah…I guess so..
Probably due to luck, there's hundreds of people who ask the same thing so many just get lost in the pool. I generally wouldn't ask the internet those questions as tempting as it is though
I looked through your profile, and I think it might be that you're just older than the average demographic for these subs. 

Most of the people here are definitely younger than a college graduate, if not high school. I suppose maybe they don't relate to you?
I never answer the passing posts. I don’t think most are looking for a true answer. Seeking validation is fine. I’m guessing those who pass very well and are pretty get more responses, but I don’t pay enough attention to be able to back this up. The sooner you can look to yourself for your self esteem, the happier you will be. If you are having trouble and need help, I hope we will be there for you. Hang in there. You  are awesome the way you are!
I understand what you're saying and don't take it as meaning your posts aren't welcome or anything. Just trying to put some thought as to why you don't get much in the way of replies. Either way it's not your fault at all and don't feel like it is.
those people also most likely have a lot more karma than you do because reddit algorithms will push posts by people w higher karma counts more than a fresh/low karma account. it's the same starting out on my art account from 0, I'm confident in the things I put out but less people are going to see it (pretty much only people who sort by new) because I don't have a lot of karma on it yet

edit: I thought I switched my account over crying. this is the art account
I feel your pain. I’m never going to be the woman I want to be. Be the best you that you can be. That’s my plan for myself.
Well, with like answers to questions or memes sure..?

I don't come here for genuine support. I turn to my partner, friends and more local LGBTQ groups for that
sorta? I would say more casual support than actually supporting. as of typing there’s roughly 290,000 people joined to this sub, which is actually just unfathomable. due to that, there’s posts every like 15 minutes. you will be drowned in the pool of posts, there’s no getting around that. but if you are coming to this subreddit for validation that will make or break you, then you’re looking in the wrong place and you will lose that game every time. I’ve been in this kind of place before where I use a casual venting or safe space as a far more serious place to talk about issues that have changed who I am as a person. maybe a person or two won’t respond to that and, through no fault of their own, my mind will twist that into a personal attack on me or a planned out move to avoid me. you just have to learn that your mind is almost always your greatest enemy and is something that will try and destroy you whenever it gets the chance. realizing I have a bias towards these things when it concerns myself has helped me a lot with these types of questions you’re asking.

when the cards are down, this subreddit is a huge amount of strangers that don’t know each other. if you have ongoing issues or require much more support and validation than something comparable to a passing hello can give, then I would recommend working on your group of friends and other closer relationships you have. therapy might also be something worth considering, it has helped me more times then I can count.
I barely read usernames on reddit,
😥do I really look that old??
Definitely have some self esteem issues but I feel like most new transitioning people do, I’m just unfortunately an old one 😭 Im massively insecure, I’m scared of my future and how I’ll afford all this, I’m scared I’ll never make good friends irl. It’s exhausting tbh..
How do you get more karma if no one likes or comments? I am trying to get out of being such a Debby downer..just living a difficult life with little real support
I feel like I’m ready to spend thousands just to get a sliver of confidence in my body.
My only support is a toddler…and I’m to busy supporting him lol. My friends think I’m weird, family is not nearby and I haven’t found local groups yet.
I think it's just bad lighting actually, in some pics you look 25 and others you look 40.
some of it is pure luck the other is interacting with people and accumulating karma from upvotes in comment threads 

this is a VERY large subreddit so it's a lot harder to get noticed in without having a decent amount of karma unfortunately, smaller spaces definitely might work out better for you
Hopefully there is something in your city. Having a local group of trans people is incredibly valuable
Have you tried parents groups? A lot of mum groups are pretty accepting.
Oh..I see 🥺 well, I’m 31 so I guess it’s probably just my age and the lighting is helping in some cases 😭
I am going to pride this week hopefully so maybe I can make friends there
I haven’t found any irl yet but that’s something I could definitely look into
I would recommend r/TransLater, mainly because you are a single mom. I also feel the people there may be more supportive of you since they are used to being pushed out by the younger side of the trans community.
Yea, your most recent pic has atrocious lighting that aged you 10 years. 

It's not that you're old, it's that this sub is majority teenagers and early 20s. (the 90s were great though!)
Does your city not have some sort of LGBTQ space? They're tricky to find sometimes but most big cities have something!
Yeah, you’re right..
I posted a few pics today so I’m not sure which one but I wasn’t wearing any make up either

I tried meeting new trans people on social networks, unfortunately most of them are as sad, lonely and depressed as me	That makes me sad for the trans community. I wish I could something, I wish I could help everyone. I'm trying to do my best but sometimes it hurts me a lot to see my trans folks struggling so much. I really hope one day it'll get better	"Not all of us feel that way all the time. Personally, I'm normally a very positive person.  Do I feel sad and depressed? Sometimes.  I have Dysphoria but it has never been as crippling as some of our brothers and sister have experienced.  My heart also aches for them.

I try not to post negative feelings on Reddit Posts.  An occasional Rant, but mostly my experiences and helpful advice.

Feel free to follow me if you'd like.  I don't chat or dm but that's because I am a very busy woman and typically jump on/off quickly.
Dysphoria is a hell of a drug, and not a good one. I'm glad you're trying to help people, I am too but I'm just a girl on hormones so there's not much I can do 😅
When I have the energy to do so, I try to be a small light in these kinds of dark spaces. I named myself Astra, after all, I've got to bring some starlight into the struggle :)
I'm pretty neutral these days, digging fall energy
If you're trying to find other trans people to socialise with, and are just looking on that basis, you're likely to find people reaching out for the same reasons as you. Try not reaching out for such specific people. Volunteer, take up amateur dramatics, take a class, do something that will get you to mix with other people that you have other thigs in common with other than the sex you happen to have been born incorrectly.
Hello, We are not always sad, it happens that we use social networks to meet other people like us and therefore we share emotions and feelings in confidence and freedom, Some are depressed, some are sad, and some just need someone to talk to.
Well wanna be friends I’m trans to
It’s all perspective! Tons of cis people are having a rough go of it too, thus the rise of dumbasses offering half-baked advice (see Jordan Peterson). 

I choose to see my challenges as exactly that - something to overcome, and something that I may have to make significant effort to succeed against. But our unique challenges aren’t the only ones. People are out there struggling to lose weight with horrible body images, people are out there struggling with their sexuality in a home situation that would leave them homeless and disowned, people are out there with medical conditions I can’t imagine.

I’m not intending to downplay any struggle, but I find it’s helpful to remember that “””normal””” people struggle too. Not to say we’re abnormal, but I feel that way sometimes. And yknow what? I think that’s okay too.
Reaching out is a start. If you can get a group chat going maybe it will cheer some of them up. Like a discord channel or something similar. I know that helped me when I was younger.
I’m happier now than before I’ll say that much
I'd say I'm fairly happy, and my troubles outside of being trans cause the problems. Remember that wanting to help everyone is a good idea, but you are included in everyone as well so take care of yourself.

It's frustrating not being able to do anything (especially being raises with a fixer mindset) so I've found that just interesting with them on reddit was enough. Answering a question, validating an emotion, or making a light hearted joke goes a long way.

My dms are open if you're looking for a transfem friend!
Im big sad so yeah
While it can be a rather bleak time, taking care of yourself and knowing your limits with others is #1. Trust me, I took on everyone’s problems at one time in my life and I was sooo depressed but once I started taking care of myself, it was easier to set that boundary and if they don’t respect it? Byeeee
The very best thing you can do to help is to make yourself a happy one! It’s def not easy but the more of us that can pull it off the better that stat gets! :)
Ngl some days can be pretty brutal but I try my best to emphasize the positives!
idk where you’re looking online for trans friends but just keep looking bc majority of my trans friends are very uplifting and good people it just took awhile to find the right friends in my community. it’s fair that we’re human and we live in trying times as trans people so the world is hard so sometime things can’t always be happy. i have noticed reddit has a lot of sad trans people but i met all my trans friend from twitter and were actually all healing on our own journeys and learning to cope as one should and i’ve not yet met many people who wanna be positive from this app personally. again i say just keep looking. it’s not ur job to help everyone bc u have to help urself and learning that helped me be able to stop surrounding myself with people like that. bc let’s face it there’s people like that in every community not just ours.
Same, I try to be as positive as I can. More often than not being positive helps other people to be positive too.

I'll follow you, I hope everything will go well for you :)
agree... but it's frustrating sometimes 🙁
That is a wonderful name! :)
oh, if you wanna talk about it you can :)
you're right, I started online volounteering in associations and it's kind of refreshing, there's queer people too! However it's hard to socialize when you can't meet them IRL. But I won't complain, I already have so much more than many others
yeah sure !
That's already a good thing! I hope it continues that way :)
You're right. I also need to listen to myself. And after all, light conversations and sweet compliments are enough to make a good day for someone so yeah!

Sure, I'd be glad to talk with you, I might DM you either tonight or tomorrow :) Thanks!
I get it, wish there was more I can do too! Big part of why I wanna be a Gender Therapist one day, so I can actually do something.
It's part of the phrase, per aspera ad astra, through the struggle we reach the stars :)
That's great! Hope you'll make it :)
That would be a HUGE help. It is so hard to find a good therapist, then add gender therapist and they are basically Minecraft diamonds

It’s annoying that everyone thinks trans girls are always happy uwu cat girl all the tome	We can also be sad uwu cat girl annoyed uwu cat girl and pure unadulterated rage because our childhood was stolen from us.	"This hits hard
Dealing a lot with the rage of a lost childhood recently.
I wish I could be an uwu cat girl. All I can do is rage that it took me so long to come out and be mad that my supportive friends and family aren’t actually treating me any differently and my supportive spouse not being interested in having sex with the new me
what makes me angry is that ONE trans person can say or do something stupid/ignorant and then close minded mfs just automatically assume all trans people are like that.  ofc there’s some bad trans people, but there’s also bad white ppl, black ppl, asian ppl, etc.  people look for any way to make the trans community look bad and i hate it.  i wish ppl weren’t so hateful
I'm too grungy and pissed off to be a cat girl.  More of a possum girl (SCREAMS). 🤔🤷🙃😵
I already had my cat girl phase when I was -actually- a little kid.

Now I'm bitter transmom ready to fight the world for my baby eggs.
I've never been misinterpreted as an uwu cat girl especially a happy one but there seems to sometimes be a thing where people don't understand how much it sucks that most trans girls never got to live the life they wished when younger. I (and most others I'd assume) would give anything for that.
I would like to formally apologize for perpetuating this stereotype
Yeah, sometimes we’re total bitches 🙃
That's horrible! I'm so sorry your spouse has lost interest in you. I know how that feels. But if they can't love YOU then someone else will. Stay strong. I send my love
Oh look a trans mom, most trans women I meet never want to have kids so it feels nice to know there are others, not a mom though still young but I want to be.
Yeah it makes me so sad that I missed so much
Tbh I’m guilty if that too
I don't have kids, but I want some very badly.

I tend to take after the emotional health of all my trans-friends and keep them in one piece tho.
*hugs*
Oh cool I want kids too but I’m a bit to young for that (I’m fourteen lol) but maybe one day

Adoption is always a choice. Remember that for much much later.

Some comments tick me off.	"So CW for SA mention and ""trans panic"" defense mention

I was on a post on another sub Reddit. Nothing to do with trans people, just a regular sub I'm in. They were talking about cat fishing. 
In the comments, someone said ""I sexted with someone several times then found out they were MTF trans... Felt like I'd been r/ped honestly""

I... Not telling someone you're trans isn't SA. This is the same argument used for the ""trans panic"" defense. As someone who was actually SAd, several times, this is... Gross. 
It's made me feel incredibly unsafe on that sub Reddit, especially since no one said anything about it. It's got a few up votes even. 
I'm just. Really grossed out that this was even said. Sorry for the rant"	"I get that. A few months before I came out to family, my aunt brought home her new boyfriend. They were talking about how they got together (online dating) and he mentioned there was this one girl he talked to for a bit that he just guessed was trans. Not confirmed, but he thought so. Talked about how gross that was, that he ghosted her afterwards, and how glad he was they didn't meet in person. The entire time I, a trans guy, was sitting there listening to it while my sibling, NB, was right next to me. Got extra uncomfortable when parents started agreeing that he 'dodged a bullet' and shit like that. Made it quite a bit harder to want to spend time with that side of the family afterwards, not to mention coming out to the family.
I absolutely despise the narrative that’s trans people are tricking cis people. When I was in the first year of my transition I wanted to sleepover my friend’s (m) house and my mom wanted me to tell his parents I’m trans so if they found out later on they wouldn’t feel deceived. So that wasn’t necessarily my mom’s perception but if it wasn’t why would she think that lmao that literally never occurred to me. That was the first time I heard of people thinking trans people are deceptive
CW and SA? 

yeah I've been hurt a few times when i tell guys im trans and they freak out. I feel you babe x
People will say I tricked them when ""I'M TRANS"" is literally the first thing on my dating profile.

People don't read shit, they just see my curves and go wild.
""trans women are deceptive"" is one of the two sides of the ""pretender vs deceiver"" dichotomy that regularly gets trans women that pass for cis either killed or treated like a failed-man failed-woman freak class if we don't.   


That person whining about sexting should have declared that they are a transphobe first, since it is vastly safer to do so than the other way around , and we get to have boundaries around not wanting to do anything sexual with transphobic oxygen thieves too    


Talia Mae Bettcher articulates the dichotomy pretty clearly in ""Trapped in the wrong theory""   


>That said, it’s possible to speak of different forms of oppression, and it’s possible to speak of different kinds of trans oppression in particular. Rather than focusing on abstract vectors of oppression defined only in terms of broad identity categories such “woman” or “trans,” I focus on a very specific institutionalized form of transphobic violence. While it is not the only form of transphobic violence, it is an important one.   
  
>  
>And it is one that cannot be reduced to sexist or racist forms of violence, although it is essentially interwoven with them. Recent literature has paid increasing attention to a specific form of transphobia whereby trans people are viewed as “deceivers”—people who try to 390 y Bettcher pretend they are something they are not. I have elsewhere distinguished two representations of trans people ðBettcher 2006aÞ: as deceivers ðthose who are discovered to be “really a man or woman,” “disguised as a woman or man”Þ and as pretenders ðthose who are already recognized as trans and seen as engaging in nothing but a kind of pretenseÞ.   
  
>  
>Similarly, Julia Serano ð2007, 36Þ contrasts two media representations of trans women—“the sexualized deceiver” and “the pathetic transsexual” ðthe ridiculous man in a dressÞ. While my account is general, applying to trans men and trans women alike, Serano’s focuses on trans women specifically. Together, the two accounts point to a general phenomenon that is manifested in a pronounced way for trans women. This gender asymmetry is underscored by the findings of Kristen Schilt and Laurel Westbrook ð2009Þ. Westbrook finds, in her analysis of media reports on 232 homicides of people “described as doing gender so as to possibly be seen as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth,” that in 56 percent of cases, the reporters “depict violence as resulting from private, sexual interactions in which the perpetrator feels ‘tricked’ into homosexuality by ‘gender deceivers’” ðSchilt and Westbrook 2009, 452Þ and that 95 percent of all cases involved the killing of a trans woman by a nontrans man.   
  
>  
>Yet Schilt also finds, in her study of trans men in the workplace, that while women can in most cases accept trans men as men, “in sexualized situations, women frame transmen as deceptive— tricking women into seemingly heterosexual relationships without the necessary biological marker of manhood” ðSchilt and Westbrook 2009, 450Þ. While the deceiver representation applies to trans men and trans women alike, it applies to trans women in more extreme ways.
>Not telling someone you're trans isn't SA.

Unfortunately, here in the UK (no idea internationally) it is. It's called something like 'deception by gender' or 'gender fraud'? I can't quite remember. But if you engage in sexual activity with someone without disclosing that you are transgender, you can be arrested and imprisoned as a sex offender.

I have no idea if having a GRC (Gender Recognition Certificate - which you can only get after providing some form of officially dated proof that you've been living for 2 years as your acquired gender) makes you immune to this ridiculous law, considering that a GRC legally recognises you as your gender.
Are you asking what CW and SA means? Sorry just wanna make sure I understand correctly 😄
yeah sorry :s i think i gather SA but not the other one
No problem! SA means s*xual ass*ult, and CW means content warning - usually used to warn of content ahead that may be triggering to some people, hence why I did one for SA. TW (trigger warning) is also commonly used!"	rsib2y	trans	71	0.96	2021-12-31 01:50:06

I had a trans flag too but i lost it... i swear i feel like my mom took it away from me somehow though.
Thanks. :)
My mom yelled at me for wanting to be a boy and having that flag.

I know that it's usually a knee jerk ""I want to protect my child"" response.  Not that that makes it right or helps in the slightest.

All through life no matter what you do there are always going to be people who want you to be something that your not.

The only thing you can really do though is be true to you.  And keep looking for those that will share it with you.

Again? Did you have to cut it for some reason? Either way, you look very pretty.
The years we spend waiting for hair to grow... I’m convinced it’s the universe’s way of teaching me something I’m very bad at. 

You look very lovely :) cherish your hair, and look forward with enthusiasm to its continued growth.
You look awesome!
Ah,well skirts REALLY help with passing,skirts immediately make people go for the she her pronouns,plus a little bit of lipstick looks awesome- and you already have a  feminine face so a bit of contour can do you wonders. 
Thank you. :-)
I went through a phase of doubt and confusion. I always heard not to throw your clothes, makeup, etc away when going through such a phase which is true, its better to put it all away and save it. But don't cut your hair either. A lesson I learned the hard way. Thank you for the compliment.

Went to Seattle Pride for the first time and realized how beautiful it was. I have nothing but cis straight friends and now I want a new circle.	"I'm a 21 year old trans woman and I've been on HRT for nearly two years, but I work a blue-collar job and retained my friends from high school. Both groups have nothing but cis straight males and me, and I thought nothing of it till today. My partner took me to pride insisting that it'd be good for me, and although I hesitated (being autistic and easily overstimulated) I put on a cute outfit and made my way out.

It was singlehandedly one of the best experiences I've had. Seeing the parade gave me so much joy and excitement, I was relieved that there were so many others like me, and being in a crowd of my allies and peers gave me a sense of liberation I haven't felt in years. 

Problem is I have social anxiety and I'm shy, I couldn't bring myself to talk to anybody besides my partner, I desperately wanted too but I couldn't. This trans women walked by me and I gave her a soft smile and I swear the smile she gave back just wanted to make me scream 'be my friend' but I couldn't, and she walked away and now the opportunity is lost.

I'm just sad I live in such a conservative bubble, they're nice but I feel like I could use friends who are more like me, I feel like it'd give me something I've never experienced before."	"Oh my god, this post cheered me up massively. I'm so glad you managed to have a good pride!!!  


Ok maybe this girl got away, but it sounds like she was really positively impacted by your interaction. You could have been the difference between a crappy day and an amazing day, go you! And next time it might be a little easier to break the ice.   


I would recommend hunting out some queer/trans/lgbt groups. if you're close to the population centre (I have no idea what seattle is like) then theirs almost always activist groups, sport clubs (especially bouldering), board game meets, club nights and whatever the cis do but better. I just takes a few people to alter your social landscape. Hope you have successs x
this is so sweet <3 besides the anxiety part!!! and i feel that 100000%. i’d say you could start by following more queer and trans people on instagram (maybe even in your larger geographical vicinity! who knows!!) and also join queer/trans facebook groups!
I need more trans girlfriends if you ever wanna hang out! I live in Everett but work in Seattle ☺️
I hope you get some nice queer friends soon
yeah that sounds great, message me :)

I'm so tired	"Hi everyone. I'm just fucking tired and sad and I could use some validation. It's just been a very long past few days.
My name is Aubrey, my pronouns are she/her, and I appreciate each and every one of you who reads this"	"Hi Aubrey!! Im sorry youre feeling like this, i hope tomorrow is a better day for you. 💗
Aubrey! What a pretty name. I hope you feel better soon.
Heya, I appreciate you too Aubrey.

Being who we are, it takes a lot. Not many people realize how much energy it does take. I feel really tired too sometimes, like it would just be easier and better if I stopped. If I slowed down.

At those times, I do. I take a moment and breathe and do something that makes me happy.

Usually it's in the evening when I am most alone I don't feel like talking to anyone and I feel like anyone that I do want to talk to won't want to listen.

I take my pillow, my softest one and I simply lie there holding it and remembering why I do what I do. Eventually sleep come and with it a new day to face more ready to face the challenges I put down the day before. Each day I get stronger and it gets easier.
I don't know you but being in this space is something special. It's incredible brave and we are all so proud of you.
Hey Aubrey. I know the feeling, and I hope you know you're not alone. We're here for you <3
Dear Aubrey,

Venting frustration and sadness is always better than holding it inside and allowing it to upset you. Positive comments will give you support and comfort in knowing that there are so many caring people out there for you.

 I find that a long walk will help me to clear some of the negative thoughts from my mind and give me a fresh start on the day. 

Take care,

Becky
Hi Aubrey! Hang in there. I have hard days like that too but it always gets better. Just focus on being your beautiful self 💖
Good morning, Aubrey! I hear you, sometimes it’s just wearing. Get a cup of tea when you get a chance, and know that we love you, girl! 💜✨
Hey, Aubrey, I love your name! Sorry you're having a rough time right now. You're beautiful and we're here for you. ✨
Honestly, I feel you. I came out as trans last week and I've slept almost 16 hours since then. It's a nightmare but you'll get through it
Aubrey is such a lovely name! 😍  hopefully tomorrow and next week will go better than the last few ones have, you've got this!
Uhg. I’m totally there with you Aubrey. Life is hard. Being trans is hard. The fact that us girls are still here, still fighting, is a testament to how strong we are. We might not win every battle, but I’ll be damned  if we don’t show them we’re a worthy opponent!
aubrey, i appreciate you too. it's gonna get better bc ur a queen who knows how to overcome all the shit that attacks her. stay safe, and do some self care (if you do a bubble bath then less dysphora bc bubbles and you can eat chocolate and read a good book. idk that's my suggestion) <3

I made my friend so happy that he started crying	"I have a friend who is a trans man. My friend and I (lets call him AJ) have gotten REALLY close these past few months. I met him through throwing shot put and discus at a track meet in April, and from there, our friendship grew quickly. We finally got each other’s contacts in May at CIF, so we were able to talk outside of track. We got really really close and started talking every day, and we trust each other a lot. He talks to me a lot when he  is having trouble with family, and I also came to the point where I trusted him so much that I told him I was transmasc a few days ago. He was the first to know.

Anyways, after a couple days of having his contacts, I added him to a discord server with all of my friends from my school (AJ goes to a school 40 minutes from mine.) They all loved the vibe of AJ. It even came to a point where AJ was able to trust them in certain situations, one that saved my life, but we won’t get into that. I’m still the only one who has met AJ in person. 

We have a vent channel in the server, where people can vent and get advice or even just have people listen. AJ was talking about how his family had made up bullshit excuses so that he couldn’t go to a trans support group. I mentioned some points, and then I said “like i get that they dont like trans people but *its for their son and makes him happy*” (i was not saying i understand why they are transphobic i was just saying that i understood that they didnt like trans people, but didnt get that they wouldn’t let my friend go if they wanted him to be happy).

My friend then said “thats the first time anyones ever refered to me as my parents' son I'm actually crying that made me so happy.” 

I feel great that I made him happy, but also sad that no one has used the correct gender terms for him even though he is out of the closet."	"This is wholesome as fuck :3
We stan AJ <3

Am I exaggerating?	"My boyfriend just showed me an screenshot of a conversation with a friend. His friend is FtM and his name is Eric, but my boyfriend has him with his deadname. I asked him why he hasn't changed his name yet and he's like ""... but it's weird to me. I don't like Eric either"" and I'm so mad now.

I told him that for a trans person is like a punch on the face being called our deadnames and that he should change it beause it's not that hard nor his bussiness, but he's just joking or saying that ok, he'll change the name but that I should know that he's uncomfortable with it.

I'm also FtM and I know he hasn't changed my name yet. Sometimes he show me screenshots with my fucking deadname there and it hurts but he doesn't seem to care.

Now: am I being too dramatic? I'm mad and sad now...

(Also idk if i chose the right flair, sorry if not)"	"You're not being dramatic.

Even if it were something frivolous (it's not), him continuing to do something that he knows bothers you is selfish and entitled, and it's unacceptable in a relationship.

Adding on the fact that it's related to your and your friend being trans, that's like deliberately poking someone's open would.

And the ""but I don't like Eric"" bit: the fuck dude? Do you just call people whatever name you like if you don't like their name? ""Hmmm no I don't like Daniel for you, I'm going to call you Gary instead"". You don't get a say in this.
Throw the whole man away
It doesn't matter if you're ""uncomfortable"" with someone's name, it's their name. If you really can't stand saying it it's on you to come up with a suitable nickname.

If I were in your shoes I'd drop him like a bad habit, but that isn't always a great first option, if you would like to *try* to get through to him you could always straight up sit down and tell him. ""Hey, you're being super disrespectful towards the trans people in your life. If you keep this up I'm promoting you to single."" Or if you're feeling a bit more passive aggressive, come up with a nice fem name for him. 

I'm sure your boyfriend Diane would *love* getting the script flipped. 

Also, 100% let Eric know what's going on. Just try to reach out to him in a respectful manner about it.
not to be blunt but dump him. There are folks out there who will see you as you are.
Drop him that is unacceptable
You're not overreacting. One of the first things my friends and family did was change my name in their phones - without being asked to. That's just basic respect honestly.
You're not being dramatic. That he can't do something as simple as change a contact name shows that he doesn't care about you or his friend as much as he cares about the mild and temporary discomfort of getting used to seeing a new name.
He has little respect for you or trans people in general. He is showing you who he is. Do with that what you will.
Based off the snapshot uve given of this man he seems to be an absolute cunt that has no respect for your identity or your friend's. I dont like to assume I know people without getting the full picture but this alone would 100% be a dealbreaker for me. He sounds abusive as fuck please for your own wellbeing leave him
Yeah that's insensitive, and degrading so idk why he would think it's ok. It's like common knowledge imo.
You are in the right here, he is being shitty and transphobic.
Ditch the bigot.
Based on what I'm picking up, does he see you as a guy? Like if asked would he say he was in a gay relationship? If he's not honoring your name I'd probably find out if he's honoring your identity at all.
You are not.

My ex did similar things to me. Constantly misgendered and deadnamed me. Her family did the same, despite me being out to all of them for a couple of years. Not once did she correct them.

I seriously regret staying with her despite that, or not even having a serious conversation with her about it. I didn't see it as a red flag at the time, but it's an absolutely huge one. People like this rarely change - so ask yourself, how long do you imagine yourself being with him like this? If he never changes? 

I know its scary as hell to lose someone close to you (I've never managed to break up with someone lol) but please do consider it. You deserve someone way better. And he does not deserve your attempts to make him a better person (especially if he isn't actively seeking that.)
If he’s uncomfortable with changing your name in his phone, he does respect you as a man, that’s it.  I’d be curious to know what he says to his friends about you, or if he sees himself as queer now that you’ve transitioned.
Start calling him by increasingly girly names and say that you didn’t like his name. You aren’t exaggerating and I advise you dump him if you can’t get him to respect a NAME. You don’t want it getting worse
If I were Eric I'd be super uncomfortable seeing this post... 

I don't think you're overreacting but I do think you should take Eric's dead name out of your post.
What a pig. You deserve better than a pig.
You may be being over dramatic, but I’ve lived with a TS person for 24 years, every time she’s misgendered or misnamed, I see a little sadness in her and I don’t like that. Just so you know, it’s almost always her family that does it
yeah the 'but I don't like Eric' was shit. Even he mentioned names that he would like more, like ""James"" or ""Ethan"". Aah anyway...
Right in the gahbage
:::((( i'd love him to be like that. Or anyone of my family
Yeah, that's transphobia right?
I don't really know if he sees me as a guy... i can't tell bit maybe a little bit. I don't think he's a terrible person, more like he's pretty stupid. Who knows
Pretty sure he calls me female, and I think he's even more uncomfortable with thinking we're a gay couple. Before coming out to him, he always called me his ""girlfriend"". Since I came out he only tells me ""partner"". Damn im sad
Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. Usually I just stand but yesterday I was quite disappointed. My biggest impression of him was always that he was a kind and respectful person, but... aah
If I'm reading the post correctly Eric is the friends(ftm) chosen name not their deadname. OP did not deadname Eric.
I know this is petty and wouldn't solve anything, but I would change his name in my phone and make sure he sees it. If he asks why just say you don't like <his name>
Gentle question here: if he's not like that is he worth dating?
Correct. I don't care what his excuse is, there is zero reason to not respect someone's name.
I keep thinking of you and your situation, I hope you’re doing okay.
Yeah, everyone is respectful enough but not him. Anyway I think I should talk with him and being a little more specific... to see if there's something to do here-
i don't know- i mean i love him but hmm. Maybe i have to think about it a litte
We talked about it. It's a little better now, actually-
I'm sure that you do. You also deserve better treatment than that. This is obviously one tiny snapshot of your relationship and I have no idea what the whole picture looks like. Maybe it's actually nurturing and amazing - only you know. But if you feel at all like you're settling, or like you're dealing with things that are harmful to you because you want to preserve the relationship....I don't know, I'd just think about putting yourself first. Because if this person isn't willing to love you the way you love them, then go find someone who will. They're out there.
It’s possible to catch feelings for almost anybody. Serial killers have female admirers .
That’s a testament to you being a loving person not necessarily him deserving your love. Trust me I’ve given so much love to so many people who showed no basic respect for me. It never gets better if they don’t do it if their own accord you can’t fix someone. You can only be patient for someone who treats you as well as you treat others and that’s hard. Let the rest go and make someone else unhappy.
I’m really glad to hear it.  I don’t know what I would do if my husband didn’t support me through my transition.  I don’t know if I would have been brave enough to do it without him rooting for me"	rqhzpn	trans	65	0.96	2021-12-28 15:12:53
I think my mom forgot I’m trans??	"I came out to my mom around the beginning of July with a note while I was at work. The first thing she said in the text was “I love you no matter what. This will probably be hard for other people to understand” (not the exact words) which made me happy but the next thing she sent was “also lots of men shave their legs and have long hair” which was a bit concerning, but nothing I can’t explain to her. She already seemed okay with it.

In the note I said not to tell my dad or sister yet, because I wanted to tell them myself and also talk to her about the best way to tell them. I felt that my mom would be the most supportive of my close family. For some reason, I still haven’t told either of them. I guess I wanted to make sure my mom fully understood so she could support me if they were against it.

We had 2 conversations about it in July where I tried to explain that being trans wasn’t a choice and how bad my dysphoria was getting. I was getting mixed messages about how supportive she was based on the things she was saying. She asked if I wanted to talk to a therapist about it, but also said things like

“There weren’t really any signs when you were a kid, this is surprising” 

“I’m worried our family will blame me for you being like this”

“If it was only us (close family), this would be fine”

I understand she is worried about what our family will think of me but I don’t want that to stop her from being supportive.

Recently I feel like she’s forgotten about everything I told her, or maybe she’s pretending she forgot hoping I would too. I’m fine with not wearing a hoodie in hot weather, but she doesn’t understand why I always want to wear jeans when we leave the house. She says I’ll be more comfortable in shorts but she should know that’s not true. I hope she doesn’t think I just “stopped being trans.” 

I want to bring the topic back up to her but I’m not sure how. I want to come out to my family so I can at least get laser removal on my face asap.

Also: I still haven’t told her my name because I’m not sure what she would think/I feel like I would be embarrassed or ashamed to tell her? And I think she would be sad that I don’t like the name she gave me


TLDR: I came out to only my mom in July, still haven’t told anyone else. Now she seems to have forgotten about things that make me dysphoric."	"This tepid support is somewhat common.  It's the ""I support you, but..."" that keeps popping up.  I support you, but this will cause problems.  I support you, but are you sure?  I support you, but let's keep it quiet.  I support you, but let's find out if you're ***really*** trans first.  This is covert gatekeeping.  I don't think many parents want to come off as not supportive of their kids, so they sort half-ass it to placate them in hopes that this is a phase and it will pass.  You'll have to step up and remind her of how you feel and what you ***need*** to do, otherwise this trend will likely continue.  You have to be your own advocate, whether it be with family, friends, doctors or therapists.
i doubt she forgot, but it sounds like she didn't really accept it either. she might feel kind of anxious or unsure in part because she feels alone in knowing about this. for me, difficult things including transition feel more ""real"" as more people learn about it, like a collective consciousness. so she perceives this as a burden - which is problematic itself of course - but she might be a little easier on you if she felt like that burden was being shared. how to make it so she doesn't have this negativity about trans stuff, i do not know. as for your pants, it's possible she doesn't connect the issue to being trans, and it's certain she doesn't understand what dysphoria is like, at all. very few cis people truly understand what it's like to be trans, no matter how supportive they are.
I suspect she didn't forget a thing but is worried that saying something will make u remember. I.e. she probably thinks this is a phase.
She's pretending not to remember because she doesn't accept you.  She's gaslighting you. My mother did the same.
Do you want a hug, sister?
I’m really sorry for you, my parents do the same all the time and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do either.
This. ""I support you-"" but calls me by the wrong name and pronouns.
In sentences like this everything before the but is completely worthless. Otherwise you just can end your sentence there.
I feel you on that feeling more real aspect. I swung back and forth with dysphoria and who I was on a given day (system my partner and I had while I was still going as NB/GF), but it feels like the more open I've gotten about it, the more certain I feel about who I am.
Feel like you're being a bit hasty with your conclusion. That sounds horrible though, so I understand where you're coming from even if I can't quite relate to it.

To me it reads very much like a coping mechanism for when you don't really know what to do. Social protocol in this situation is still basically the wild west, we don't have an accepted cultural norm yet. Now admittedly this could be me reading myself into the situation as that's basically what I do when I can't figure out the social protocol of a given situation. Ignore it for the moment in the hopes that it either goes away or, (in situations more adjacent to that described by OP) someone either walks me through the protocol or breaks the tension by calling out that we don't really know how to react. It's not the healthiest coping mechanism, but it's seems fairly common.
Social protocol is to believe, support, empower, respect, and love your children for who they are.... some mothers fail at this, some of the time.
That's definitely the ideal. I feel like i didn't quite get my idea across. If your friend comes to you and announces their engagement, you generally know the response to give, down to the exact words to use. Someone coming out, in basically any form, doesn't have that same level of widely accepted social protocol. With that in mind, I can see why she might freeze up. Not staying it's good, just presenting an alternative from my own experience. 

To clarify, I'm neurodivergent, a large number of my responses to news from other people is dictated by active choices based on my understanding of social protocol around a given situation (as opposed to the unconscious understanding of neurotypicals). When I don't know what it is, I tend to freeze up.  Before I accepted myself, I ended up in a similar situation and my response was basically ""Cool. Really not sure what else to say."" Not my best moment in retrospect, but considering that person is asleep next to me right now, I'd say it turned out ok.

I think I finally understand why pride is so important.	"Back in the Before Times - both before the plague and my cracking - I didn't really understand why Pride was still a thing.  Human decency had *won* - or so it seemed to me when I was too wrapped up in my own nonsense to notice the mountains of evidence to the contrary.  I'd still always intended to go to one just to see what they were about, you know, *as an ally*, but never got around to it, and then they were cancelled two years in a row.  I guess it is fitting that my first Pride at all was my first Pride as myself.

The festival itself is, I'm sad to say, not for me.  I was lousy in noisy crowds before the plague gave me a reason to be nervous, and I've *never* managed to enjoy live music.  Still, it was worth attending, even if it did result in several unasked for sermons and pamphlets explaining that I'm a hell bound monster.  Actually that might have been my favorite part.  When a shy youngster shoved the first hateful pamphlet in my hand, I was a bit confused - until I read it.  I was of two minds about it:  that this kind of thing *actually* happens, and, also, that it was one of the most absurdly useless gestures I've ever seen in my life.  Everyone in front of me glanced at the pamphlet and tossed it in a bin seemingly places for that exact purpose.  A few different people were preaching and more or less following the same script.  A cursory exploration of who the hell they were was enough to learn that they'd traveled a few hundred miles to be there.  On my way out I advised that they need a better hobby which was as usefully received as their own sermons were.

The parade, though...I'd not intended to ever march in a parade ever again if I could help it since the army had informed me that parades are miserable affairs.  But with coming out, I've also become something of an activist.  I didn't intend for that to happen, it's just that once I started paying attention, I realized that human decency hadn't won.  To that end, I signed up to march with my local Planned Parenthood chapter.  I ended up having to speed walk more than a mile having utterly misjudged just how long it'd take to get from the festival to the parade route, but made it just before the starting whistles sounded. 

I now know how Caesar must have felt during one of his Triumphs.  Behind me was a hateful capital I've spent many weekends at in service of one cause or another, every time feeling as if I might as well argue with the marble itself for all the good I was doing.  But Saturday I saw something else:  hundreds of thousands of people *cheering* for people like me.  Hundreds of thousands of people who, for whatever reason, decided that they wanted to spend a hot-ass evening packed shoulder to shoulder while a few thousand people like walked by, waving our little plastic flags and rainbow lights.  (It being approximately ten thousand degrees, I opted to wave my giant plastic trans fan instead.)  For a person with my particular eccentricities, it was akin to trying to fill a bucket at the base of niagra falls, and yet in spite of the fact that overwhelming is an understatement if ever there was one, somehow I wasn't overwhelmed.

Somewhere near the middle of the parade route I noticed a few people with signs offering hugs from a mom or a dad.  One of them had come from just as far away as the preacher had.  I burst into tears at that, though I'm not sure anyone noticed since I was drenched in sweat.  Three or four complete jackasses had driven across the state to be absolute bastards, and here were dozens of people who'd driven across the state to offer someone a hug.

For an hour, I felt like an absolute super hero.  For an hour, I thought that maybe decency would win so long as people like me are still willing to go scream at marble and take a nice long walk down the street.  For an hour, I was reminded that most people aren't bastards, and that we're not alone in this.  In that hour, I finally *understood* why pride is so important.

I also got a free shirt."	"Damn, your writing is captivating. Thx for sharing OP.
There was a pride event down in Toledo  This past weekend that I felt bad about missing.  Turns out i have covid, but i really need to get to one
It has its place. But I find it so so cringey how Pride has generally forgotten its origins. Where I live, transphobes and political parties oppossed to transfolks do the parade. And nobody adresses the racism either.

Its a hollow thing for me. I don't attend. Because Im a contrarian and because my empire of dirt doesn't build itself.
Thank you your writing and details are so inspiring, I will have to push through my anxiety and go to pride one day. Never ever planned on going until now, hopefully I can and I feel safe enough to in my city 🏳️‍⚧️💞
This is really cool, thanks for sharing.
I can certainly understand that perspective.  There was plenty of corporate sponsorship, and I'm under no illusions about just how mercenary that is.  While my own natural inclination trends toward cynicism, I won't yield to it on this point.  Yes, it is mercenary and, as such, utterly amoral.  That sponsorship happens because it is profitable to do so.  It is entirely devoid of noble intent.  I know that this sound like a cynical view, but hiding within that observation is a point:  it is *profitable* to be accepting.

Think about what that means for a moment.  It wasn't all that long ago that the only sponsorship such an event could hope for was from queer organizations.  It was not so long ago that non-queer brands would distance themselves from it entirely.  It was not so long ago that pride had to be true to its roots in a riot, when it was an act of desperate *defiance*.  And now pride is brought to you by Apple, by Verizon, by Indeed - because now it makes business sense to do so.  Because being queer is less radical.  Because you no longer need to gird yourself for a street fight.  It was a festival - a celebration, and the parade was a triumph, not a march to battle.  It is proof that progress is being made.

And that I at last saw why it still exists in spite of corporate sponsorship, in spite of losing its teeth, is proof that there is still progress to be made.
The first time I went to a protest, every fiber of my being protested.  The law didn't affect me.  I didn't know a single trans kid whose life was going to be made harder.  I was entirely convinced that I'd be one of the only people who cared.  And yet, if not me - a person who was so steeped in transphobia, who was so injured as a child that I was only able to discover my truth because of an epoch-ending plague - then *who*?

The same went for Pride.  I thought that maybe I'm not queer enough, not trans enough.  That I was an imposter.  That I, as evidenced by not understanding why such events still happened, had no right to it.  But if I, after a year of HRT, after so many soul-scouring nights, after coming out again, and again, and again, don't have a place at pride, who would?  And I certainly have fair reason to fear that some maniac would do something terrible.  Am I to let such a miserable person raging at what they don't understand ruin the possibility of a better future for myself.  Am I to yield the field to them without ever showing up?

I can't grant you courage because such a thing isn't transferable even if I had any of my own.  All I can say is what I always say every time I can bring myself to answer a question of ""how do I find the courage to do *whatever*: you don't.  Or at least I didn't.  There is no one who can march for me or celebrate for me, or defend me *except me*.  However long the odds, the only thing I can do is try and risk failure, or do nothing and fail all the same."	wv2onv	trans	68	0.96	2022-08-22 19:26:04
advice needed: my kid just came out and I need all the help.	"Hello, this is a throwaway account because I do not want to out my kid before she is ready. Also this is cross posted from r/lgbt

Please if I am wrong about something correct me because my knowledge about trans people is very superficial but I am willing to learn.

Here's the situation: I am single mom to an 11 years old kid, about 2 hours ago kid came out to me as trans (born a male but identifying as female)

I have a lot of questions and I am still a bit confused but please help me either by answering or by linking me to resources that could help. Sorry if I am a bit rambly.

First: I get the pronouns thing, I will use she/her. But she is not out yet to other people so how would that work?

Second: my first reaction was to discuss therapy, not because I think her coming out is wrong or anything but because I am a firm believer in utilising therapy during times of change.

Third: she brought up transitioning and thinking about it eventually, who should I contact to get informed about it.

Fourth: when she is ready to come out to others, how do I deal with the administrative side of things with school

Fifth: if she wants to change her name, should I help with that? Is it ok to make suggestions? What about taking her shopping? She has never wanted what is traditionally considered feminine toys or clothes (aside from a kitchen and doll when she was younger) so I don't know what's ok and what's not.

And finally: how do I deal with the whole sex talk? I was planning to give it soon but now I don't even know where to start. Is her being trans makes liking boys being straight (and vice versa)? or is sexuality based on the birth gender? 

Please help me, I want to be supportive but sadly I do not know how to.

PS: I validated her feelings, said I was ok with whatever she felt is right and asked for a bit of time to do some research so I can be better equipped to handle the conversation. Was that right?  

Edit: thank you everyone for all your advice and kind words, and for the awards too, I will do my best to follow up on what you told me."	"I don't have the time or energy to thoroughly answer any of your questions right now but I thought I'd pop into the comments to reassure you that you sound like a great mom and it sounds like you're trying really hard to give your daughter the best experience growing up trans. Kudos to you 💛
1. That would be something to talk to your daughter about. As much as it hurts to be called the wrong pronouns, it's much safer that way than being outed to someone who is unaccepting, it would also be good to just talk to her about who its okay for her to come out to. 
2. The therapy comment, to her, may have been taken as but unwell. It shouldn't be forced onto her if she does not want it, if she does want it be sure to find a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ children who is not going to try to talk her out of transition or be mean to her. 
3. I am unsure of this but maybe look into pediatric care for trans children. 
4. I think it would be good to set up a meeting with school administrators in private to explain everything, although that is something I have never had to deal with
5. I think its good to help her in name discussion if she so desires. I'd say wait on shopping trips until she says that she wants to get things that are more traditionally feminine
6. With sex talk, as much as it is difficult, you should still explain it based on her sex, her genitals, so she understands how it works. Sexuality is more of a personal thing, and its really up to her to decide what label she wants to use.
Head over to /r/AskTransParents.  I have a hard time with long text posts, but if you want to discuss things one on one, feel free to PM me. 

Therapy is a good start.  Look for a therapist who specializes in gender identity counseling. 

An endocrinologist is going to provide care for gender affirming medicine.  They're going to be able to give you the best information about the medical portion of the transition.  The therapist will be a good source of information about the social aspects of transition.  We trans people will be the best source of information for the personal experience. 

I personally would have loved to have my mom help with my new name.  You will need to fill out legal name change papers, but the school end of things should be simple. 

Standard sex talk will suffice.  Tailor it to their preferences if they know them yet.

Again, I'm happy to talk via PM.  I'm a 46 year old trans woman who has a 13 year old daughter and 14 year old son.  I'm an open book.
Let me start by saying you sound like an amazing mother. I wish all trans people had at least one person in their life like you. You came to the right place supermom. 

First: I'd say just keep it at home for now, give her time to adjust, that's a big step. Most trans people don't using their pronouns everywhere for a while, just close friends and family. 

Second: what you likely want is a *gender therapist*, or that and a conventional one. 

Third: what you'd want to do for that, if it comes to transitioning, is likely the transgender care services offered by planned parenthood, or an LGBT friendly endocrinologist. Just tell them your child is seeking to transition to a different gender. 

Fourth: Schools are either going to be extremely cooperative, or not cooperative at all in this regard, depends on where you live I'm afraid. I'm not gonna sugar coat it supermom, this is gonna likely be the hardest part. Administratively, trans people just aren't taken very seriously yet. Deadnames, wrong pronouns, misgendering, run rampant in that. Best you can do is tell them what you want changed and stay on their ass about your daughter being gendered correctly. 

Fifth: If she has a very masculine name then she will likely at some point want to change it, I see no reason why you couldn't help her find one, that sounds so sweet. I'd suggest trying out a few for a while, seeing how they fit, how they feel. Also, this can be a very costly process, as to change a name you need to make an APPEAL to do so, and it can be denied by a judge, I'm afraid I don't know more than that. 

If she doesn't want traditionally feminine things, that's okay! My girlfriend wears plaid, jeans, and boots everywhere and is very much a woman. Your gender doesn't define your tastes, but If she wants them, hell yeah. 

And finally: So treat her new gender as her gender when talking about sex stuff. Her being attracted to women (trans or cis) would be a homosexual (lesbian) relationship. Although! Keep in mind, plenty of trans women don't have reassignment surgery and opt to keep what they have. Keep this in mind medically, their anatomy still requires all the attention medically that a cis person would. 

P.s. you're already doing amazing by her, you should be proud of yourself, I certainly am. But listen. This is gonna be hard. I'm not trying to discourage you or your daughter but you need to understand that society doesn't always treat us well. She's going to need you big time to build her confidence back up when some small minded person tries to tear down her identity. I'm rooting for you both, Supermom.
1) consider who she wants to be out to as well as her saftey! if she wants to not come out to someone, PLEASE do not force her. if there is a situation where you fear she may be attacked/ridiculed, use he, but remind her in private why (try not to scare her, and yes i know, this will be difficult)

2) i believe there are therapists who specialize helping trans people! do LOTS of research before hand to make sure they arent biased or want to 'fix' her!

3) i would suggest puberty blockers, but admittedly i dont know much about them other than they keep puberty at bay. but honestly? i wish i had taken them when i was young. in the mean time prepare her to transition socially by choosing clothes she likes and wearing them around the house to become more confident wearing them!

4) im actually not sure about this one! maybe someone else knows more about this one, im so sorry

5) i would 100% recommend making suggestions! but in the end her name should be her decision. and if she doesnt seem to lean towards more feminine things right now, dont push it, but remind her the option is still there

5) i would say it might change a bit depending on who she likes, but i would at least cover basics! such as necessary protection and consent. either way, she should know that if sonething makes her or the other person uncomfortable, its ok to stop and talk. communication is key in any relationship!

and honestly? you did the right thing by taking time to learn for her. this is what every parent should be doing! you not only accept her, but also want to make sure she is safe and loved! if you have any more questions, i will do my best to answer! :) bless you two!
I’m a teen who’s figuring myself out actually, so I don’t have good answers to your question. But I just wanted to say that even your willingness to learn is great :)
11 is very young, they should have some time with therapist, over the course of a couple years before considering HRT. Some effects of HRT are irreversible not to mention the amount of hardship your child will go through socially. These social problems have gotten better for some parts of the US, but for many parts it has gotten worse. Be prepared for adversity and cross your fingers the GOP does not seize power.
1st question: I would address her by she/her pronouns when it’s just the two of you. Then once she has come out to others it be safe when your around the others that know. 

2nd question: Most definitely get her into counseling as they will be invaluable in reaffirming her along her journey. Best to find a LGBT+ friendly counselor. Your best resource is finding closes LGBT+ center close to you and use there resources. 

3rd question: As young as she is there is nothing they will do till she’s in her teens. It also depend on the laws in your state/country. Once you find a counselor for her they should hopefully guide you as she ages and give you information you may need. Again your local LGBT+ center will be big help to you.

4th question: You’ll probably have set up a meeting with the school administrator, principal, and her teacher. From there you’ll have to just tell them she wants be referred as a girl and give them her new name. 

5th question: You’ll have to ask her if she’d like suggestions or if she wants to pick one out herself. It’s most important just to support her and love on her during this journey. As for shopping just take her with you and comfort her let her pick the clothes out. 

Final question: You’ll have to ask her what she’s attracted to. Being trans doesn’t dictate your sexuality. She could be girl attracted to girls= lesbian. Or she could be a girl attracted to boys= straight or she could be attracted to both bi/pan.

Overall just stay opened minded and love on her. Let her go at her own pace and allow her to express herself how she’s comfortable. I want to say thank you for coming here and seeking advice! Good luck 🍀
I see other people have helped you already so I just wanted to say as another trans kid your willingness to help your kid is really heartwarming, you’re doing a good thing and I do hope everything works out for you both :))
Hi, I'm newer to this myself but I can help. I definitely understand feeling a little lost, it's alot to take in, but you sound like an amazing mother and even just your support means the world to your daughter right now.


    First: With the pronouns, if she is not out yet to other people and isn't ready, ask her whether she is comfortable using he/him or her birth name in public. If she does decide to not come out to the world immediately that fine! You can become a sort of safe space at home where she doesn't have to hide. Maybe she also has a friend or two (in the community or not), that she might feel more comfortable coming out to. Small steps with that, and only when she's ready, but the more support she has the better.


   Second: Therapy is definitely a helpful resource and in my opinion a necessary one. However it, like most of my advice comes down to communication with your daughter. Sit down and present the idea to her, ask her if she might feel comfortable having one that might be able to help her work through this. Working through your newly discovered gender identity can be very confusing, for her and for you; therapy is definitely something that can help! 
     
    I'm not well versed in any resources for therapy specifically, but there is a resource I do know of. 

TrevorSpace is a social media type community for LGBT teens/young adults. An amazingly supportive environment that helped me through alot!



Third: I'm also not well versed in this subject, I've had to put off figuring it out myself with how busy Ive been. 

An article I found online seems to be fairly helpful, geared towards parents of trans and mentions mtf specifically. (Male-to-Female)

   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/2003011/help-transgender-child/amp/



Fourth: I'm homeschooled so..✌️

Fifth: Certainly! That can be an amazing bonding activity between the two of you. On the name change, ask her if she has any ideas about it, and whether she would like any help? There are all kinds of methods and resources the community uses when finding names. 
    
   On shopping, anything she can do that is gender affirming, should make her very happy. However she may or may not be comfortable going out in public and shopping for women's clothing, again this is something you can ask her.

   Some small activities you and her can do at home where she may be more comfortable:
    Maybe a makeover? Again, offer the idea and see how she responds, but maybe she would enjoy painting her nails, or learning some simple makeup? I'm still in the closet myself but i personally would melt if my momma offered to do those things with me.

    Maybe you can surprise her at home with a skirt/dress/etc, if she expressed interest and ask her if maybe she'd like to try them on and show them off?

If she doesn't feel comfortable with any of that yet, maybe a simple piece of jewelry she can wear and not be outed. Something I think would be cool myself, is maybe a necklace with my chosen name on it? 


Sixth: Ok this, can be confusing, but no, it's not based on gender identity. Your daughter may like girls, boys, or anything in between; and these labels are just that, labels. If and when she decides who she likes, you can figure out a label if you wish, but you don't need to.

    I was wondering this myself, I am trans MtF, at this point however, I still like girls, does this make me gay/lesbian? I have been told yes, but the label doesn't really matter. 

   Who your daughter likes may also change in the middle or after a possible transition. If you believe she is old/mature enough, have the talk with her. If you feel comfortable, explain the idea of non heterosexual relationships as well. 


Lastly: You are being amazingly supportive already! Masses of people like your daughter wish they had parents like you, so don't worry. You're on the right track, you've told her you accept her and you're there for her. All you have to do now is walk this path with her, whenever you're confused/concerned, seek out help like you've already done, research as much as you can. The biggest help you can be is be her support, and keep communication with her, always make sure she's comfortable before taking a step. 


Don't panic. This is just like anything else in life, whether your child is going to school for the first time, or they just started driving, or dating. This is just another challenge you two can face and tackle together.

You're doing wonderfully💖💖
Trans parent of a trans kid. It’s not true that there’s nothing dr’s can do. There’s a whole thing set up for this. Normally you can find a gender clinic in the nearest childrens hospital. At this age (dependent on how much puberty she’s actually experienced) all that will happen is that she gets blockers that prevent her from starting male puberty. Please don’t skip this step. The faster you get it done the less (potentially damaging) changes will have happened to her body. 

I put my kiddo on blockers at 12. 11-12 is a common age to go on them. The point is to buy the child time to fully explore their feelings before permanent physical changes happen. 

If you want you can dm me.
My child starting coming out (it was a process) around the same age.  He’s 15 now and started socially transitioning around 13.  The best advice I can give you, which will be very hard as a parent, is to follow your child’s lead.  Let them know you are there to support and help them be their authentic self but pushing shopping trips or names or anything really isn’t a good idea imo.  Shopping trips for example can create tremendous anxiety and dysphoria.  She will let you know what she needs and when if you just support her.  Transitioning is a process and not a fast or easy one so take a deep breath and look into joining transfamalies.org.  They have great, age based support groups for parents and you will learn a lot listening to other parents.
I think the best thing you can do right now is show your love. all the complicated stuff can come later. maybe tell her you want to take her for your first “mum daughter shopping trip”, and buy her traditionally feminine things (nail polish, cute shirts, etc). have a nice meal out. just show how much you appreciate her. your doing great mum, I wish every parent was like you :). feel free to dm me to ask more questions, I am a trans kid myself so I can give advice :)
Hi there, I the mom of a (trans) young man, maybe I can field some of this. I can tell you you're on the right path- being supportive and just listening is huge. Super important though- **you do not need to have all of the answers right now. It's going to be okay.**  Here's  my solutions to the questions you're asking. Sorry this is gonna be long- you asked really good questions. 

1- Pronouns- this is gonna be the tricky. When my son came out, he came out to us only for a while, it took some pretty substantial rewiring and I absolutely messed up the pronouns when talking to people who didn't know. There are tricks to help, but you will mess this up. Follow your kid's lead and comfort levels with this. Communication is HUGE. 

Added difficulty- it is possible for your child to change directions as they navigate through this- and that's fine. Maybe they totally know and are set and it's not gonna change, but .. it's possible, which is what gives us parents nightmares. One of my favorite movie quotes ""Thus far you have been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience"".. give your child the sheltered harbor of your patience. 

2- Therapy is controversial. Personally, it was therapy that brought this to our attention. Without getting too much into parts of my son's history that he's NOT comfortable with me talking about, he was having a rough go and my husband and I nudged him into therapy. I personally think that it's great for sorting out stuff and while he's not there anymore I can still see his therapists effects and what he got out of it. I don't think it's crazy to enlist the aid of a therapist *to help your child sort out their feelings.* That's not the same as enlisting a therapist to talk them out of this. Check your listings- you can find lgbtqia+ friendly therapists in your area. I'm not unhappy we went this route.

3- Who to contact about information transitioning- Honestly, I had my son write a paper about the benefits and dangers of the types of transitioning that were more permanent than hair cuts and clothes changes. It reallllllllly helped give him a better perspective on what was achievable, what he wanted and how to talk to doctors about it. I also told him that any change he wanted to initiate **he** had to talk to his doctor about. It's not that I'm not supportive, but he needed to learn how to advocate for himself. It was the best decision I've ever made in regards to helping him with this. At this point, he is very comfortable with talking with medical professionals who often do not know as much as he does about it.   


Side note- his primary care doctor has been nothing less than STUNNINGLY amazing about it. I mean, really they bring me to tears with how fantastic they've been. They said that they'd never dealt with this before themselves and wanted to make sure my son was getting what they needed. They are the best! 

Extra side note- if you're truly at a loss after that, contact a gender services clinic in your region. Pediatric endocrinology may be able to help direct you as well. We also have lgbtqia+ resources but honestly they've been more difficult to get in contact with for us. 

4- How to deal with school administration- Depends on your school district- For mine.. man, I gotta tell you the pandemic has been good to us on this front. They had a year off, this is when all of this went down. It was simple to just move back into school with the new name. It was simple to just tell them- My child that you knew by this name is now this name. That's really all they need to know. We simply just told them of the change, kept it low key. We've only had one problem with one teacher who had my son in a class before the pandemic and my son thought it was a true accident and it hasn't occurred again. Bathrooms aren't an issue for my son- he just doesn't use them in public, which is probably something he needs to work on, but . yeah.. other things. I humbly suggest a transition with a name that's stable at a period of a break, like spring break. Let your kid lead the decision on the timing of this.

5- Name changes, transitional goals- We don't know what's okay and what's not either. Talk to your kid. This is the best part of this whole journey and I absolutely do not want to rob you of the closeness that having these conversations brings. That said, I had the same questions and he didn't know either. We had to talk about it and figure out what was comfortable. I got to have some input on my son's name, but he had final say. Our first experience shopping was online. Your experience will be uniquely crafted to what your kid wants and is comfortable with. Expect changes, let names marinate before committing to them. There's time to figure this stuff out.

I will say that after receiving feedback from the community, we (my husband and I) opted to go ahead and pursue a name (and gender) change on our son's birth certificate before he was 18, had established credit, job history, etc. Depending on the circumstances and where you live that might be an option for you. Even then by the time the court order was done, he was on his third name- hah! 

Lastly- the sex talk. We talk a LOT about consent and what that means. We talk a LOT about how to be safe, not just from STDs but also .. like not drinking unattended drinks in bars, telling people where you're going, watching out for your friends and strangers in places. Its more survival guide than anatomy class. 

Again, you don't need to know all the things right now. It's gonna be okay. Sorry about the book here. I keep telling my son I'm going to write a guide.
1. Definitely talk to the kiddo! You could even ask them to write out who is ""safe"", that way you don't have to try and mentally remember. 

2. Personally, I think that's fine. They'll need a therapist anyway to do anything medical (when it comes to that), and from experience I can say it is a lot easier if you already have a connection to someone. I've had to wait two months for a therapy appointment to get on hormones. But be careful because there are therapists who will try and tell your kid ""it's just a phase"" or stuff.

3. It's still quite a ways off before they can do things like hormones, however puberty blockers are an option. I'd check your insurance and put our some feelers for specialists, but also make an appointment with your pediatrician to see if they have a recommendation. Unfortunately, there are doctors set out to hurt trans kids.

4. The school legally has to change their name and gender in all programs. I'd suggest filling out a gender support plan - I believe GLAAD may have one, but if not, just a quick Google search will yield results. I'd suggest talking to the school counselor first.

5. Ask them. I know when I came out, there wasn't anything I really needed (aside from a new haircut and a binder). I was comfortable in the clothes I had, although to be fair, my mom didn't limit me to the boys or girls section. You could always take them clothes shopping and just ask, ""would you like to look in the boys or the girls?"" I know it might seem like they've never expressed interest, but they might have been too scared to ask or you might have subconsciously put them into the boys section by automatically going there (which is no fault of your own!).
Thank you, I just fell into a deep research hole and I just got more confused.
Thank you so much, I might send you a PM after talking with my daughter.
Thank you so much, these comments showed me a lot of things I didn't even think about. I have a feeling I will be spamming posts because I don't know a single person in RL who is trans or has a trans family member.
Thank you so much. What I am getting from these answers is that I shouldn't be afraid to discuss these matters with her and to ask her directly what she thinks on them
Thank you, it makes me feel better
I can't even think about the midterms. Thankfully we live in a pretty liberal state with some great pro-trans laws.
Thank you for the advice, you guys have brought me down from the panic I got after falling into a googling hole.
Thank you so much
Thank you for the advice and kind words, and I hope your journey is also great.
You're welcome.  If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.
I figured, that's why I followed. This is why places like this exist, so you can always find someone to answer your questions so you can help your daughter. It's not going to be easy for y'all but you're giving her the best possible future with your love and support.
absolutely :) she obviously trusts you, and its easy to see why! and dont be afraid to admit if you dont know how something works, because no one can know everything ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so dont feel bad! it will be a learning curve for you both, but it will be worth it in the long run! :3
Absolutely! I'm sorry it was so wordy, I tend to do that😅

I was looking up how to remove facial hair bc I’m a trans girl and sometimes I look up info on puberty blockers even tho im 19 and it’s way to late and I often feel sad inside bc I wish I got this option years ago is this normal?	Do any other trans girls get sad about this??	"yes, i totally have felt the same way, although i’m a trans guy i often get sad that i didn’t figure it out a little earlier, it would have saved me a lot of pain.
It’s quite normal honestly, I went 27 years blind to knowing I was trans, even though I regret never finding out sooner, I know I have a second chance to become and embrace and love my true self, and give myself experiences I deserved to have earlier in my life.  Sending hugs, I hope it gets better sweetie. 🫂💙
You can still get bone structure changes, it's never late to start hormones
Yes. So much fucking hair I hate it.
Have you tried a IPL
Existential dysphoria, or ""Why did I spend so long denying this when it would have made me so much happier even if it was so much more difficult?""

It's a bitch, but we all live with regrets, trans or not. We have to build a future to look forward to.

I started HRT at 31, life has never been better. Despite being what most would consider an attractive person, I never went on a single date until I started presenting feminine. Lost most of my peer group just because it felt increasingly hollow, but now I've made more friends in the past year and a half than the rest of my life combined.

It's never too late.

Physical changes from puberty don't really end until you're about 21, so you're far from too late, you are in the prime time to get HRT without anyone telling you you're too young to know it's what you need.

Puberty blocker is a simplistic name for something that suppresses sex hormone production, Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) analogues, the same drugs are used for most gender affirming HRT here in the UK regardless of age, and also to induce early menopause in women with conditions like endometriosis. They'll stop your body from signalling your testes to produce sperm and testosterone.

They're not 100% necessary for that, as your body sends these signals in the absence of sex hormones, T or E, doesn't matter which. So if you take estrogen, testosterone production will reduce anyway, as your body sees it has enough of a Gonadotropin. Estrogen only is more difficult to regulate early on, which is why GnRH blockers or anti-androgen are commonly used.

I don't mean to over-rationalise your feelings, I just find it helpful to set out that the idea of puberty being something permanent and irreversible isn't quite so straightforward. Our bodies always grow at every age, so do our personalities.

The sadness still hits me sometimes even though my life has improved immeasurably for transitioning. Years of repression don't go away easily, but especially finding other trans people who can understand and sympathise make it much less of a burden.
know that i kept developing new facial hair follicles long past the age of 19 because i wasn’t on HRT at that time
19 is relatively early its when i started and hrt has really helped me. :)
I do too. If only I was taught what being trans is, I’d feel a lot better now
Yes. Very.
Yes
Yes your not alone girl. But don't worry a lot of trans girls don't start hrt until late 20s or like me I started at 23. 

There's ways and options to stop facial hair. So you don't gotta stress about it.

✓ Hair laser removal is permanent
✓ Shave your face. Not permanent but Marilyn Monroe shaved her face once a week so men ain't only ones that shave their face. 
✓ Electrolysis is permanent 
✓ Waxing but best for body hair not facial hair. 

Hope my my comment helps you feel better girl🏳️‍⚧️🙌 Keep your head up. We will all get through this one day we won't have to stress about hair on our faces🏳️‍⚧️🙌👩‍❤️‍👩
I started transitioning at 20, and I'm only 2 months in but my facial hair has slowed WAY down is thinner too. I shave my face around 2 or 3 times a month.
I am still waiting to start HRT and I am nearly 40. Yeah, a lot of us feel this way, no matter what age we are. Just another thing for the cope pile, I guess!
IPLs on eBay, I paid 20 plus for a warranty..
I known I was a girl for years but nobody told me about this option.
can hormones change your face structure?
I’m hair on my legs and face grow out fast and I have to shave constinl
What’s that
they change the fat distribution in your face, they don't do much in ways of changing your bone structure, there's ffs (facial feminization surgery) for that, if needed. the voice doesn't change either, it has to be trained. This is how it works for trans women. Trans men have their voice changed, idk about bone structure
A bit, but it's all mostly just fat distribution
M2F At pre-puberty and up to about 24 HRT does change structure, and depending on age stop voice dropping (T blockers) or hair etc after that it's just muscle and fat distribution. And more dopamine ?
I have to shave my face everyday. I hate it.
I figured it out it stands for intense pulsed light, you can search ipl on amazon for easy results. Prob gonna buy one myself now 😅
My skin is so sensitive I cant shave every day, so I have to have stubble for a few days before I shave again. I hate it so much.
eBay is where it’s at!! I paid $20 plus a warranty.
Oh shit
If it’s one thing I learned from styropyro eBay lasers are not to be trusted 🥲
Cause one happening means that’s how it is for everyone?!
If you knew his channel you’d understand lol, just basically safety isn’t guaranteed because sellers can lie about how powerful a laser is and cause someone to get hurt by said lie because they are using a more powerful laser then they should be.  Also the worst thing that could happen other than skin burns is you go blind because if said lies. I have anxiety so I will over worry about these things 😭😭
Anyone can lie about anything.. the platform doesn’t negate the liars.. if you play your life based off of what the absolute worst can be for things.. You’d probably learn something from the laws of the universe"	v8z5rr	trans	64	0.94	2022-06-10 04:11:37
Help dysphoria is killing me	"I recently came out as trans to my family and in the past two weeks my dysphoria has been REALLY bad. Most days i feel awful whenever i am given enough time to remember i have a gender and night is just awful. Its just me and my thoughts. Alone. In the dark.

I have become way more upset by deadnaming and misgendering to the point where i threw a badminton racket at my friend. I just wish i could be a girl so bad. My sister was complaining about having period pains an said i was lucky i didnt have to deal with that and it made me want to cry. 

I wish i had someone to talk to who understood how i felt. I have been going to an lgbtq+ group every 2 weeks but it got canceled because of covid and that made me so sad. Therapy is too expensive and the nhs is more useless than a sponge teacup so i turned to reddit to help. 

I  feel like i will never be a woman and i should just give up and pretend im cis so my life is easier. How do i deal with this it is ruining my mental health and I dont know what to do

Tldr: help dysphoria sucks"	"If you’re considering therapy, I recommend taking a look at https://www.psychologytoday.com/us - it’s how I found my therapist and she’s been amazing so far 😁. In addition to zip code, you can also filter for more specific qualities like “LGBTQ friendly” or “trans-friendly”. Check descriptions, credentials, training, and where they practice before deciding on anyone. The more details on their profile, the better.
I absolutely hate when my female friends would say things like "" you don't want to be a girl"" while complaining about their period cramps, and I'm just in my head like "" you have no idea what you're talking about. I would gladly suffer a week or more of servere period cramps if it meant that had the ability to give birth, how dare you speak for me."" 

Also for some reason not having period cramps = I have no idea what pain feel like. Like wtf i might not get monthly cramps that last for a few days but I have been sick before. I once went a week without eating because everytime I tried to consume something (even water) I'd violently throw it up, it felt like someone was using my stomach as a punching bag. Another time I had food poisoning so bad that I couldn't lay down, my stomach muscles couldn't relax, had to us a heating pad cause I couldn't keep pills down, was up all night with cramps so powerful at one point I felt like I ripped something.

Tldr, stomach cramps hurt no matter what gender you are. No body likes it when  you try to speak for them.
I swear, the first year of your social transition will give you the most dysphoria and pain. But it's the only way to be seen as a girl in every way. There will come a time, SOON, that you are not misgendered every day. I hope it comes very soon for you.

You are doing the emotional work NOW so that you will be happier next year
When I came out to my fam I had a similar experience. I had the worst breakdown of my life. My dysphoria spiked. I basically hid from people for a week. It didn't last long and I went back to normal. There is no solution to this, but you will get through it and become stronger for it. Good luck to you

I’m so tired of TERFs	"Why can’t they leave us alone? I just don’t understand how people can be so hateful, twisted and just horrible. The worst part is they claim their feminists when they’re just horrible bigots twisting feminism to justify their transphobia. It makes me so angry and just sad. Like why don’t people just let us live? Fuck I’m so tired of ts. I’m so tired of being seen as a creep just trying to assault girls. I’m so tired of being made into a fearmongering strategy so more bigots can gain power. I’m so tired of every day in the news hearing about more anti trans bills. Im tired of being seen as a boy. I’m tired of all of it. I wish it would stop. 

I need a hug"	"I'm so sorry. It really sucks.

I firmly believe things will get better, but we're living through a particularly shitty time right now.

Look to the people who care for and support you.

I know this is cold comfort if you don't live in Australia, but I'm incredibly heartened that a conservative politician was slapped down by the voters earlier in the year when they tried to campaign on transphobia. It was a safe seat they should have won easily, but the public went 'nope!' and sent them packing. Even if the conservative government had been returned, I would have still counted the night as a win just because of that one bigot's defeat at the ballot box (however, the conservative government was also turfed out on their ass, too, so it was two for two!).
Sending virtual hugs 💗💗💗
Sending my virtual hugs to you !
The reason is as old as time itself, people, in general, fear that which they do not understand. Ignorance has many faces, and so does denial. 
I'm giving you a massive hug 🫂. I don't have an answer for you, everyone is different, you need to find your own truth.

I know what you're currently going through right now. Here is my hug 🤗🤗🤗 from the deepest part of my transfem heart."	za8qwz	trans	58	0.92	2022-12-02 02:39:33
Nonbinary kid comes out to closeted nonbinary dad...	"I'm a 40yo mostly closeted (out to some close friends,   family, and so) nb trans fem (6 months on hrt) and my 12yo just told me out of the blue while waiting in a parking lot for her mother (still my so) that they don't feel like a girl... or a boy. I was like ohh... So you don't say, apparently she's been questioning her gender for a while. I'm also nonbinary and would have loved to say how much I relate to all these things she was saying to me, BUT... I've already agreed with their mother not to come out to my children until they've had enough time with their therapist... who knows when that'll be.

I still can't believe it happened. It was like 12yo me was talking to 40yo old me and the best I could do was give them a bunch of generic shit about how I love them no matter who they are or how they dress instead of telling them that I personally know where they are right now and how I know how hard it can be. 

Their mother joined us in the car not far into this conversation and was just as shocked as me to hear this and considering how many years she watched me struggle to find who I was I could tell she was doing everything in her power not to brake down crying. Later in private she reiterated she was crying not because she was sad about them coming out, but because of how it brought up all the feelings related to my transition what we've had to deal with and it's just hard to think they'll possibly have to struggle because of it. 

I know this is pretty specific but have any other trans folx here had their kids come out to them as trans and how'd you handle it? I don't typically care about what other people think about how I run my family but I can't help but to worry about how some people will think I convinced them to be this way, but the reality is they have no idea whatsoever that I'm trans yet and I've never even used the word nonbinary in my own home before so having my child say it to me was completely unexpected."	">I've already agreed with their mother not to come out to my children until they've had enough time with their therapist... who knows when that'll be.

I think you have a pretty strong argument now that *not* coming out to your children, at least this one, is actively causing harm.
I think that's amazing! Talk about having understanding parents. I hope you'll be able to come out to your kids soon too 🥰🥰🥰
OMG this!!  This is beautiful
Same, except closeted trans femme. My oldest came out as non-binary about a month ago, and for similar reasons, I couldn't just say ""Hey, awesome! I'm trans!""

I did basically what you did, which is to say I reacted to them in the way I'd want to be reacted to in their shoes: with nothing but support and love and immediate acceptance.

It all went fine, but yeah. It's hard to watch someone so close to you come out of almost the exact same closet while still needing to stay in your own.
Reverse, I came out to my dad and found out he was closted mtf.
This is an amazing opportunity for you to support and connect with your child! I think the child’s needs supersede any comfort agreements between you and your spouse. It’s definitely time for a celebration!
Out of all the things the universe would throw at me this  was not even on my radar until the moment I was hearing it. Thanks for making me feel not so alone, it's nice to know I'm not the only one in the world navigating something like this."	tgkve8	trans	62	0.96	2022-03-17 21:31:03
Almost started crying in school today out of rage	"Today in art class I was fucking around with clay and I made a dumb joke about how it was hard like my nonexistent bottom part and the kid next to me went “You’re weird..” and I said “I’m trans!” and he immediately said,

“You’re not trans, you’re a she-male.”

Was silent for the rest of class, was too sad and upset to even wedge clay properly."	"I'm sorry that happened to you. What an a-hole 😡 You're not what he called you, you are trans! And you are valid!
Everyone I knew in school became alot more understanding of the world in college and post high school. I hope it gets better for you as time goes on :)
I’m so sorry you went through that. Just know that you always have a place here to escape idiocy and ignorance.
Man he sounds like an asshole! I just hate it when someone makes a joke where it's mean enough to make you feel like shit but not quite mean enough to say anything against it without coming off as the jerk. 

Sorry you had to endure that. You ARE trans! ❤
It sounds like it's time to smack a bitch
Well at least it means this moron thought you were amab, I guess?

Afraid to go to school	Hi! I was at home for a week because of covid 19. Tomorrow i have to go to school. I’m shakeing and i can’t sleep bc i got bullied a lot because of my identity . In our school we have to dance at the end of the year ,one boy and a girl (I’m Mtf pre everything) and the girl wanted to dance with said no at the last moment bc i am trans so i feel very very low. Any advice for a sad girl who needs to go to a christian school at the next day?	"Skip school when you have to dance. Say you're sick.
Speak with your teacher and tell him/her you are not comfortable and you don't want any of your student body (classmates) to feel uncomfortable. Ask if you can sit this one out or provide any other alternative. Maybe a solo so you can still be part of it? I'm sure they will be very understanding.
I wanna go with you so bad now
Sending you very warm thoughts. I also went to a Christian School, but feared for my life so I didn't come out until way after I graduated.  


You are so brave, but always put your mental health first. Can you skip the dance rehearsal and the dance?
As I understand it You are still living with Your parents. I know Hungary is not the best place to be trans (I'm closeted as fuck polish femboy, only a few people know this about me) just as my country. This said, the thing I'd recommend is to bite your teeth in an just go with the school. So what that You can't get the girl to dance with You? Screw her and everybody that is a dick to You. Remember that this ""school is best part of Your life"" is utter bullshit. Real life is real life after You move out of your parents and stop taking any money from them. Then You are free. Then the real life for the girl like You begins. I know what I'm saying, I was bullied too, not because I'm trans but because I was always a bit of a coward and feminine - I was fighting fire with fire and became masculine and now my fiance is reintroducing me to femininity. That is another part - You WILL be accepted. Maybe not by Your workplace, or Your school, but by the ones that truly loves You - your friends, family (tho I know this is not given) and by Your soulmate and believe me - either You are into girl or boys or both like me - there is that special someone waiting for You, that person will love You and accept You for who You are. Just have patience and work on Your independence. Then You are untouchable. I know this sounds like shit advice but it worked for me. I always wanted to be feminine, wear makeup and girly clothes, I consider transition due to top body and body hair dysphoria and I'm free to do so any time as I'm not dependent on anyone, but wasn't for the better part of my life. There will be peace for You girl!
Sziaa

Fuck them. Do you have to dance thats weird. Like what if some shy kid cant find anyone do they get in trouble. Also what if someone doesnt know how to dance. If you get in trouble you get in trouble. You wont fail. Maybe ask a close friend, just be clear its platonic unless its not. You do you worst case scenario you get yelled at or something. Its a shitty situation it wont last forever and most people wont remember your embarrassment if its really embarrassing.
Drop out of school. Get a GED instead.
But i have to the dance rehearsal bc we have it instead of a class
Hmmm Hungary + christian school sadly
Sadly not
Szabad a dm?
14yrs old crying at the corner
skip or sit on the side
In that case id just go for it if you can. Show up in a dress or some feminine clothes. Just shove the biggest fuck you in your school's face as possible. Or try to get expelled and go to public school
I mean homophobe af
Damn, I understand that, we are basically neighbors, Slovakia.. I can imagine what it is like there with people. The best I think that you can do is talk with teachers or someone intelligent enough to understand what's going on. Maybe try to talk about it with your parents if they know your situation? They could speak up about it with teachers. You could also try skipping, and tell teachers you don't want to have any part in rehearsals (not sure if I spelled it right). Since it's Christian school it must be even harder.. I consider myself mtf as well but I'm not out completely even to myself so I can't talk from experience, but try to speak about it with someone you trust and find solutions together. I do not know your school and teachers there or anything else so it's a bit harder to find solution.. But I'm sure if you can speak with someone close to you, you might find support to get through it. And if not, I'm not sure how is LGBT community in Hungary, but you could try connecting church of Satan (don't worry about the name hah hah), they support LGBT around the globe so you can try to find help there and speak with someone from your location or country. That might be the best solution I can give you. :/ I wish you luck good luck friend! Stay safe and tell us more after something changes. Hopefully for good. :)
you won't know until you speak up.
I’m sorry. Stay strong. Let us know how it goes, if you can.
I used to skip school every day to get high, and skateboard, then one day I decided to just go get my GED while I was ditching school. I never had to go back. Best decision I made in high school.

Ask stupid questions...	"I came out just over a year ago. My dad and I have this game where he pretends I'm not trans, and I pretend that his outright rejection doesn't bother me. A year ago, when I first asked him to use my correct pronouns, he just replied, ""no."" I politely reminded him of my pronouns once, a few months later. This time he said, ""how about I just don't refer to you at all."" 

I've made peace with that. Being myself has brought me so much joy, and his disapproval is just a small disappointment. But it seems like he's under the misconception that if he's passive aggressive enough, I'll stop being trans. Asking my sister why she doesn't call me ""she."" Asking me why my friends don't call me by my birth name. 

And today when we were shopping and he saw me coming out of the bathroom. ""Why were you in the men's room?"" he asked. 

""The usual reason."" I had to pee. 

His response, predictably, was to sigh and walk away. Maybe one day he'll realize that his lame attempts at confrontation aren't going to change anything. 

Not today, sadly."	"Wow he sounds like such a prick. You're super strong for how you're handling it and recognizing that the joy you get from being yourself outweighs the pain that his behavior brings ☺️

Positivity Post	"Hey y'all.

I'm feeling really down lately, like I can't find where I'm supposed to belong. We all need to see some positivity. Sometimes this sub is filled with a lot of sadness and hate. Let's add some light to it, shall we?

Put something that is currently going well for you. It doesn't have to be big. Could be stupid. You'll see mine in the comments - and it's pretty stupid. But this is therapy for all of us.

Go for it! :)"	"Today I packed a Dunkaroos in my lunchbox, because I'm twelve, apparently.
I have started the curly girl method, I'm so happy to have a hair routine! I was so mad with my hair it looked so sad, hoping to see results soon :)
I asked my mom if she would pay ear piercing for me and she said depends on how much it costs, so not a complete no

BTW I am a 16 year old Trans mtf still mostly in the closet and she is one of the few people who know and she is supportive

Even though I usually scar pretty bad, my scar from my trach shave is healing fairly well. I'm really grateful because a scar up near my face would be a lot harder to deal with than a body scar.
I’m 3.5 months into a new job and everyone is coming to me for help, saying I’m making quite the name for myself as a great engineer.  I’m not out yet at work and still look and dress fairly androgynous, so I’m glad to know that I’ll already have a strong professional reputation to back me up when I do come out.  Yes, it makes me happy to feel valued.
I made a pork and zucchini stir fry. One of the most basic dishes and one of the ones I've cooked the most often. It turned out really well and I'm feeling pretty happy about it!

I've been on E for half a year and it's been rough at times, but I love all the little changes that are happening :)
Today is not going very well unfortunately. 

Regardless, I got a haircut this past weekend with my significant other. This older lady sitting in the salons waiting area said to me ""you look like such a handsome young man. Like you're getting ready to go to an interview."" It was very sweet and grandmotherly. Scratched an itch I didn't know was there. It's keeping me going for rn
I found out wearing yellow makes me feel more masculine, it's great, currently sitting in the car outside McDonald's eating a chocolate ice cream and wearing a yellow hoodie, i'm happy, i love this, I love yellow. And I have ice cream, I see this as an absolute win
I'm in the process of opening a new store for my company that may be one of our busiest in the area. It's been going well so far.  Tomorrow I have my appointment to start hormone therapy. And I've started to ""come out"" at work and everyone's been super supportive.
Just found out my family's insurance covers all transgender stuff like hrt, blockers, top surgery, etc, so I asked my mom if she would look into puberty blockers and see if she had any objections against it, and she said she was fine with it :DD
Um I absolutely HATED needles, and now with practice I do not even feel uncomfortable giving myself my injections! 

My skin is soft, my hair is much nicer, and I am actually starting to see more of what I want to in the mirror...

It could go a bit faster but I'll take what I can get!
Yay! The IRS let me go on a payment plan!
Woohoo! I have many curly friends. My hair went curly after my last kid was born - what a mess! Having a good routine can set up your whole day though :)
Aw, so sweet on two counts, then! Glad you have a supportive mom. Hope you find a great piercer - take care of those ears and stay away from nickel jewelry until you heal!
Nice! Passing stuff for the win!!
Oh right on!! Pride bracelets rock. I wear my chakra bracelet at work with my ""no shame"" one. Make sure if they're elastic that they don't pinch!
NICE :)
Stay hydrated!
Indeed! So happy for you. Drink lots of water and even if there's still a scar, you have options - medical tattoos and even great concealer! :)
Good, you should feel valued. You are valuable. I'm so glad things are going well for you at work :)
Yum!! Sounds delicious!
Sometimes just making it to the end of the day counts, amirite?!
Goals for me, bro. I don't know if I'll take the leap to hormonally transition but this is what I think about. Congrats :)
Yay I love the ren fair!!
Thanks and if you have gotten ears pierced before can you give me advice because I am deathly afraid of needles and stabby things going into me

If it helps I just want a single piercing on both earlobes
Thanks!

Yeah, I love to worry but it'll be fine if I can just learn patience.
If you do it at a quick place with a piercing gun, it's quick and pretty painless. Maybe a pinch at the most, especially with the lobe, which doesn't have a ton of nerve endings. I would recommend though, if you're really going to do it, look into local tattoo parlors and ask. Doing it with a straight up needle will make for a better piercing in the long run.

I don't relate to anything else said about depersonalization, I relate to these two sentences right here.		"I do have a history of not caring about my body, I just never got really fat or anything because I can’t gain weight very well. But I definitely generally don’t eat well and have a hard time caring about shaving and stuff because there’s no point if it’s just gonna grow back in an hour
This was found on [the gender dysphoria bible.](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) And no, I am not claiming to have depersonalization disorder. All I'm saying is that I relate to this one part of it. I've always thought my face looked weird in the mirror. I'm always surprised that that's what my face looked like. I feel like it should be different than it is.
Ah don't worry, usually I (when not looking in a mirror but down at myself) feel as if I'm just a conscious or an alien controlling my body.
Had that partly as a result of a major anxiety disorder. That said, I hope one day I can be genuinely confident and happy with myself.
Yeah this happens to me sometimes, even when I look down at ny arms for example I know I'm controlling and moving them but it still feels like they're someone else's and not my own, almost like I'm watching thru someone else's eyes
I ended up with this because of some nasty trauma.

I wake up sometimes like I've been asleep for months and panic like ""oh shit, how did I get here?""

Knowing that I am transitioning is a real comfort at times like this."	10n6yfd	trans	56	0.93	2023-01-28 05:14:37
Pregnancy	"Hi all! 
I wanted to post on here to see if maybe anyone else has struggled with this or might just have any advice. 
I identify as a non-binary trans person & I am close to 11 weeks in my pregnancy. My fiancé is really my only support as far as gender identity goes and I’m just sad I guess because I know once I have the baby I’ll have to take upon the role of “mom” or “mommy” because of my mother in law & own mother. I feel stuck and invalidated to a degree, and I just wish I knew how to handle these feelings better. Thanks for reading."	"What would you prefer to be called in place of mom/mommy/mother?
it's gotta be difficult because obviously pregnancy is the most feminine-coded thing in society, but i've met a lotta enbies/trans men who have familes and gone through it. i suppose it'd be like going through the name/pronoun changes with everyone all over again, having to specify what you'd prefer to be called. just be confident in yourself, having a child doesn't change your gender or who you are :) 

as a side note; i'm a seamstress with special experience making maternity wear, including for transmasc folks. if you need any clothing advice feel free to reach out :)
I just bought a book [Like a Boy, but Not a Boy](https://arsenalpulp.com/Books/L/Like-a-Boy-but-Not-a-Boy) that should go over this per the author’s experience. From the preview I had with this book, it talked about exactly that. I am transfem and it’s still helped me. ❤️
Transguy here on week 20. Sending you love. Spending time building a chosen family can bring more of that type of support. I am not telling my parents for this very reason (but I live far away enough and don’t visit for years at a time). 
You are allowed to limit contact with people who are not supportive, you don’t even have to tell them why (unless you want to). You are allowed to set boundaries and get FAMILY support from people who are not related to you. This includes an online community, or an LGBT+ group ❤️
Ima just hoping that you have a healthy pregnancy and baby.  Every breath.... goodness.
Mabey discuss limiting, or cutting, contact to your stepmother, with  your partner 

And consider doing the same with your own mother
maybe check out r/Seahorse_Dads? it’s more for trans men and masc aligned individuals but it might help?
Youuuuuu could ask your fiancé to be an equal part in your child’s development so that the “role” of “mom” doesn’t need to exist
Think of your very own special parent word to have your child call you! It's done for grandparents so why in the world not for parents too? You've got some time currently too come up with something that really vibes to you and feels like yeah,that's me
That’s the thing is I don’t really know any sort of neutral terms other than parent. I haven’t ever had kids before so everything is really new to me as well.
This may help.

My moms bf just yelled at me and left the house bc I asked my mom to turn down Tucker Carlson talking about trans people negatively.	"I just can’t stop crying. He’s never yelled at me or gotten angry at me ever. I just asked my mom to turn down the tv while I was in the kitchen bc whatever segment  was on about trans rights was so long and wouldn’t end and I wanted to make my food. He freaked out on me. I didn’t say anything mean or yell I just asked for it to be turned down. My best friend is trans. And for context I guess, I 
 am a cis hetero girl. I hate hearing stupid negative rhetoric about trans people and it makes me so upset. I can’t believe my moms boyfriend got so upset with me…. I didn’t say anything about what was on tv, I just asked for it to be turned down. I knew we didn’t agree on trans people in general but why yell at me? I’m just so sad. I don’t really know how to process this interaction."	"Sounds like he's got his own problem with something, and he's gonna have to be an adult and deal with it. You did nothing wrong. Tucker Carlson is a sack of shit.
I'm sorry that happened to you. My dad's whole side of the family watch Fox News religiously. I grew up in a house where it was blaring from every tv in the house all day long so my dad could be anywhere and still hear it. Could practically hear it from the fucking street! I can relate to how easily they are triggered when they hear that not everyone wants it cranked to 11 every hour of the day. That shit is poison.

Good job taking a small stand against bigotry. Its tough when there is a relational power dynamic at play, but maybe he will realize he was a dick to you for no reason once he comes down.
I can't get over the fact that one of the biggest transphobe losers alive is named ""Tucker"" 😆😏
So let me get this straight the guy your mom is dating yelled at you and freaked out and left because you asked for a tv to be turned down in your own home that's a crimson flag in and of its self I'm particularly curious to see how your mom feels about all this cause you ain't his kid or anything to him and he thinks he has the right to blow up on you like that what's that say about how hes willing to treat your mom who he thinks he has some kind of stake in by being in a relationship
You didn't deserve to be yelled at, no one does, especially by some asshole your mom is dating. You have every right to be upset about all of this. How did your mom react?
What a piece of shit.
Did he not just take it as you being rude asking for the volcume to turn down?
He does, he and Fucker Tarlson are just angry. It’s somehow extremely disrespectful when I quietly disagree about this specific topic. And he pulled the I’m old so I’m smarter card. Ew!
Thank you so much for your comment. I hope he apologizes, as much as I feel like I did something wrong I know I didn’t.
Sometimes It’s hard to stand up to “adults” in these kinds of situations even though I am an adult myself. 
Frick Fux News!!
She is very upset about it, but we haven’t talked about it really since that night and he still hasn’t been back to our house. I’m curious how she will handle it once he is back around. I expect an apology from him and I hope my mom sees how fucked up that whole situation was.
Nah it was definitely about what was on tv
my mom's ex used to pull out that card too. He was really dumb. I'm sorry, your mom's bf sucks. Hopefully he'll become your mom's ex soon too.
Na he just had way more time beeing stupid.
Yeah, that's that power dynamic talking. This idea that they have some authority and that makes them right. You did nothing wrong. Maybe you could have brought it up in a more gentle way that didn't cause him to get offensed but I wasn't there so I can't say for sure. Adults should be able to handle their emotions better.
Well he’s usually great! I’ve never ever had him get angry at me before. It makes me sad ya know.
I didn’t say anything to set him off that I know of, I feel like I’m usually very gentle and I just asked if my mom could turn it off for a minute. He also appeared to be ASLEEP but was apparently listening to fucker tarlson…. So stupid. I know I didn’t do anything wrong so I just hope we can move past it at the very least.
that's what my mom thought when she first met her ex. First couple years were great. Went all downhill from there.

It's not okay that he becomes so angry at you, he's not supposed to yell at you. Especially because you're not his kid. And even if you were, it still wouldn't be okay to lash out like that. 

I hope it doesn't make you more sad, because he's not worth it. Even if he is nice most of the time. You didn't even do anything bad. 

I hope you're alright
For sure. I assumed from your story that you are pretty non-confrontational and it must have been a lot to cause you to even ask. 

Also...listening to that man with eyes closed as if he's some guided meditation track is next level XD

I hope the best for you and your friend. They must be fortunate to have an ally like you on their side 🙂
Ugh I agree :( I do think he has some sort of anger issues. I hope he doesn’t blame my mom or anything. I’m willing to move past it I guess but I’ll never be able to forget it.
Hahahha yes just like a guided mediation!

Advice	"I am treated poorly at home and am very unhappy and because of that my grades are failing miserably and I am severely underweight.After Aton of work I have gotten them to only slightly support my name and pronouns but they still don’t accept it and it bothers me and makes me feel just wrong and I’m just so tired of being made to suffer for no reason. I have just recently turned 18 and do have people that can take me in. But how do I go about actually talking to my narcissistic father about and actually going through with moving out

Edit:Damn mods are really doing a good ass job. I get a notification for a troll comment and it’s gone before I can even read it all. I’m happy because it keeps others from reading it. But I honestly find the sad people wasting their time trying to upset people to be really fucking funny. 
If you’re a transphobic troll go ahead and just dm me so I can see your joke of an attempt

Edit2: should also say that it’s only a minor issue that my parent are being difficult with my gender but this community is just full of supportive people that I know can help me because they know a lot of my struggle and have probably been there themselves once. Or there are others in my situation looking for the same advice"	"There are 2 kinds of people in this world. Those who are loving and accepting and those who are not. You can't reason with the notes If you have a safe place to go then do that just as long as you stick to your guns. Your a legal adult so he can't stop you from doing what is best for you. Be strong you got this!
If I were you I’d just get my stuff together one night, don’t leave anything, leave your parents a note and don’t tell them where you’re going. My mother is a narc, and I can tell you now that I don’t talk to her I’m a LOT happier. I know it might take awhile to get things together, but just hang in there
I'm going to go on a tangent here and just say how upset I am that you need to reach out on Reddit in order to get some support and validation for your feelings.

I'm not upset with you I'm upset with the system we have in place to where you would need to go to social media for advice as opposed to an official government funded agency or nonprofit.

This ..... This needs to be remedied.
I'm all about the lgbtq however the last two letters of this organization have little to no non-profit organizations and support groups.
There is not enough support out there.

Sometimes...it is hard to not agree with you honestly. That said I think there is room for some to grow. Others, especially those heavily indoctrinated by religion I feel are far more likely to not change their hate filled ways.
Ok that is encouraging thank you
Yea absolutely. I am very lucky to be living in proximity to Portland be cause there are some organizations that have helped me get treatment and HRT for a very low cost and I only have to pay because I support them and want to help others that are struggling more
Legal name is changed but that’s the least of my issues wouldn’t try to move out if that’s what’s happening. I’m being denied fair access to food and being treated like shit it’s beyond my gender. People have every right to refer to me as they please and I won’t fight them on that. Maybe don’t make assumptions that that is all it is about. It is an annoyance and is contributing to my unhappiness but there are many more things going on
There’s still hope for the heavily indoctrinated! Source: am a formerly extremist Christian. It’s a hell of a lot of work, but I’m slowly unlearning all those harmful thoughts and behaviors.
Of course! I hope you can escape them soon, and don’t listen to anything they tell you to put you down. You’re amazing
I live in Massachusetts which is very liberal however the only groups that are here are 23 and lower.

I would kindly ask that you don't support any group that puts a age cap on much needed support.

Ageism is a form of bigotry in that can't be tolerated.

Fuck NAGLY!
Lmfao he deleted it
Yea that’s very true. The place I go to does have an age cap of people that they are able to help. They specifically are around for homeless youth but they also help trans youth that can’t get care due to unsupportive parents. 
I feel that trans care should be one of the few things that are heavily assisted and should be treated like an absolute critical medical condition like diabetes and the state should help with a lot
Unless it was the mods and in that case thank you. Makes me wonder why people come in here preaching transphobia just kinda sad lmfao
I know right? Such a sad existence. There's more transphobes on here than usual too, poor mods."	u28bup	trans	58	0.88	2022-04-12 20:15:44
How do i stop misgendering my friend?	Im not sure this is the right sub and I know that the title looks pretty bad but let me explain, i have a friend that uses they/he pronouns and they’re trans, i know that person for a long time and they recently came out, however i try my best to never misgender him. However once or twice when we hang out I’ve accidentally used she/her pronouns on them, this is not because i view them as a woman, its because im used to using she/her pronouns in general because i usually hang out with people that use those pronouns (I’ve once misgendered my cis guy friend as well accidentally), also i am dyslexic and I hadn’t thought about it but maybe this could have something to do with my brain using she/her pronouns on people without even thinking. When i said that i immediately apologised and explain that it wasn’t because of them, however they seemed pretty sad afterwards and i know they probably got dysphoric. I’m trying to never misgender him again but I’m afraid that i might do it on accident again, i really don’t want this to happen so could anybody help me out or give me some tips? (Thank you for reading that btw)	"The biggest thing to keep in mind is to catch yourself when you misgender them, immediately correct yourself, and continue the conversation like nothing happened. And then if you're worried about having hurt them, talk to them about it in private later. The worst thing you can do when you misgender someone is make a big deal out of it in the moment, as this draws more attention to it. Usually most people won't pay any mind to the slip up since it can happen to cis people as well. 

Mistakes happen, the important thing is that you're making an effort. I'm sure your friend understands. (:
Practice.

Out loud, or in your head. You’re used to doing it one way, now get used to doing it another. Your brain needs to consistently make the association between your friend and their gender identity. The more times it does this, the more automatic/habitual it will be for you.
It takes time and it’s gonna be hard, the brain literally will wire itself for quick response information and if you have known this person for a very long time your brain will have deep connections to what you have always known about this person, and thus the neurons firing and causing you to misgender them is bound to happen, I learned in my college class that it takes time for brain to prune synapsis you no longer use so just reinforcing and correcting yourself it will come in time and you won’t have slip ups as often. But above all just always apologize and show you made a mistake we are all human, change takes time, and I’m sure your support means a lot to the individual in question 💙 don’t expect your brain to train itself over night I wish you the best and I hope you find the help you needed ☺️
It’s honestly a learning process. I mean my best friend of 7 years has to relearn my pronouns and name, and that can’t be easy😅 as a trans person, I’m not expecting it perfectly and I understand it’s an adjustment.

It’s very telling that your so concerned about misgendering them, and that’s very sweet. Don’t be too hard on yourself, and if you do accidentally misgender them, try to make it light (ie *forehead facepalm* sorry, I’m still getting used to it *preferred name* I’m trying really hard and I want you to know that it’s not on purpose.”
Maybe you should try writing about them some. Simple sentences, that use his name and pronouns. Or write the same sentence over and over for a bit, it doesn't matter. But writing is an active process. It engages the person doing the writing. So this may help you soak in their pronouns as more of a default route in your brain.
Drink water...?
Ohh thank you so much! I will try to do that
Oh that really helpful, i will try and practice as much as i can, thanks a lot!
Aww thank you so much! This helped a lot"	u3awrc	trans	57	0.91	2022-04-14 06:30:37
Just a friendly cis person checking in to say sorry for the idiots	"Sorry you have to put up with all those ignorant people, the misinformation, the scandal headlines, the bigots, the religions... I know you just want to get on with your lives comfortably and without being harassed or treated differently. I do my best to defend you, to try to educate people, to change their thinking, but there is just so much out there it makes me really sad.

Be strong, live with compassion, and don't let the bastards grind you down."	"Thank you friendly cis ally :)
Thank you, I really needed to hear this ❤
Thanks! It's always wonderful to hear words of encouragement. Especially on a day like today.
Hello I would like to order one supportive cis, here's $1,000,000,000.99, yeah, keep the change
Thank you! It's nice to read that. It is appreciated.  Just had an interesting little conversation with someone who  isn't a friendly cis person.  Glad to know y'all are here.
❤️🤘👩🏻‍🦰🤘❤️"	ffhrfo	trans	53	0.94	2020-03-08 19:37:44
On Coming Out	I sadly never was able to come out on my own. Due to some mental health issues I was having, the cops, after receiving that info from me, passed it along to my parents without even really asking me if they could. Despite this, I've decided to reclaim my coming out. It's been a little over a year, and I've finally started my social transition! I'm proud of myself, and I just want to encourage any person reading this, may it be trans, non-binary, ot anything really, to be proud of yourself too, just for continuing to exist! Take care 💜		mu2c1m	trans	53	0.97	2021-04-19 14:53:31

How to deal with people who start a transphobic discussion out of nowhere?	"My coworker often starts discussions where she complains about all the different genders and that she doesn't like how everyone can be anything. 

But yesterday, it was the first time ever she started to talk about that she doesn't see, that transgenders have a right to get pronounced in the gender they identify as.

She even said, if she gets to know about that someone is changed now, but had a different body from the birth, it would be hard for her to see them as the gender they are now.

I just said that I don't care about and to each his own, mainly to end that discussion. 

However, that though hurt me a lot. I'm a transgender, but on over 10 years on hormones and nobody sees the difference anymore, and only a rare circle around even knows about.

But hearing someone talking like that makes me sad and scares me to get emotional close to someone. And I'm afraid of not being accepted when I find someone I really like again."	"HR please. I am uncomfortable or offended by her transphobic conversation. 🏴‍☠️
I don’t think there’s much you can do.  Outing yourself to her would just cause you a lot of grief.  There’s really nothing worse than these people that just bring up things that literally have nothing to do with themselves.  Like okay you’re a straight cisgender woman but you literally think about trans people constantly.  We, as trans people, are less than 1% of the population but occupy like 25% of their spare mental space.  It’s some kind of weird obsession.  Almost a derangement.  Like, can’t you live your life and enjoy without thinking about how much you hate some group of people for no reason? 

There’s just not any way to manage these types of people.  I’m in the US and I’ve known Fox News viewers that act like this.  They get so worked up about things that have literally nothing to do with them.
if you arent at risk of outing yourself make them feel really stupid. if someone they think is cis stands up against transphobia they might reconsider, but its probably easier to just report her.
no discussion just fistiecuffs
If you're in the US- this is a reportable thing to HR. You don't have to out yourself in the process, just report that your coworker was making transphobic statements openly and you're afraid it will create a hostile work environment .
I'd be tempted to give them an eyebrow-raised look and say, ""Hmm, the lady doth protest too much, methinks."" If she's confused, just say ""It's a Shakespeare quote. Look it up.""
Find out about what discrimination your employer enforces. Not all consider being trans as a protected class. If your employer considers gender identity a protected class, report your coworker. You don’t have to identify as the protected class to be uncomfortable in the workplace when discriminating speech is being said. Just like you would report racism or sexism even if you weren’t the target of said speech. 

And I’m sorry you’re having to endure this.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear this. What they said was dangerous and hurtful, but good on you for ending that conversation swiftly AND protecting yourself.

You're allowed to feel hurt and I hope you heal from this. It's difficult being trans, but I will say bc bigots are so bold nowadays they often tell on their selves (as your coworker did). 

To answer your first question, what I do in transphobic discussions is de-escalate, change the subject, and make as many jokes as possible. Never let 'em see ya sweat but take none of their shit.
I had a friend like that. His ""I just can't see how..."" conversations were frustrating to listen to. Many people fail to understand the denial, self loathing and mental health anguishes trans people often go through before they ultimately accept themselves and take steps towards self realisation.
It's painful but just a college, my teenage daughter drops statements of how disgusted she is on a regular basis...
If someone ever said this sort of thing to me at work I would just ignore it and send an email to HR.

You aren't going to sway someone's perspective
In a sort of meta way it does concern them. Simple people need simple boxes in order to comfortably function and when the world and other people in it refuse to fit those boxes it's deeply upsetting to them. This is the handle that right wing propaganda uses to manipulate them
I'm in Germany. And here is sth similar. But we are a very small working group. So, in any case, she would know that comes from me.

Except that, we have a good relationship. Maybe that's why her opinion hit me like that.

I'm thankful for all your advice and compassion. 

Now, I thought a bit about it and had the idea to ask her the next time if she knows that talking like this is the same sexist like it would be racist to say the n-word to a black person. 

Maybe this comparison helps her to understand that she is talking about something out of her business and that she will never understand why it's hurting people in a way she can't comprehend.
yes at a small company/business it can be very complicated, I completely understand. I hope if you do have that convo that it goes well!
Thanks :)"	10hn96b	trans	54	0.93	2023-01-21 09:19:55
