Big Win for acceptance :D		"Apparently this crosspost is shown in r/all. It‚Äôs crazy to see the upvotes and downvotes on this. I guess we are far from there I‚Äôm afraid (in regards of acceptance)

Edit: still the upvotes win from the downvotesüòÖ
Its also from a decent brand and doesn‚Äôt shout gay or trans so you could probably say its just a sport bra
I‚ÄôM RUNNING TO THE LOCAL TARGET SOMETIME THIS WEEK. TIDDIES BEGONE
sadly i live in the uk

no binder for me
Wait, they're tomboyx? From the little I know, that's a decent brand?
Get in brother we're going shopping
Omd that means queer teens can pick out a fitting, good quality binder and buy it on their own.. that's amazing! I hope our stores in Germany do that, I always buy second hand because shipping is as much as the binders themselves.
I hope they‚Äôre comfortable. Does anyone know if the fitting room people would measure someone? My current binder is a bit big for me, and the last one was a bit small. Apparently I cannot hit the nail on the head for binder sizes.

Honestly pretty cool that they got transmasc stuff *before* transfem stuff. I've been seeing a lot lately about trans men feeling overlooked and ignored in comparison to trans women and I think it's amazing for our kings to get a huge nod like this from something outside the LGBT+ community.

A big hell yeah to all my gentlemen out there! (And to my ladies/enbies who aren't fond of their titties!)
Right on target! That is great news, now to just get someone in other countries to follow suit!
Are they by any chance less expensive than like $50 ;-;
I hope it stays past pride!!!! This is huge!!!!
Fuck yeah!
Target also sells some really nice padding-less sports bras from Joy Lab and gay parent friendly mother's day/father's day cards! 10/10 recommend going to target if you want big box store gay stuff. They still make money off of queer capitalism, but at least they try to be leaders in what queer stuff large chains will offer.
Does anyone know what brand is good for binding bigger chests?
Weird choice of brand name but otherwise good.
I am not familiar with the need for these, how do they work?  I thought this was a sports bra that got hung upside down.

I am genuinely curious and not trolling here.
Does anyone know what section that would be found in? Is there, like, a specific section for the pride stuff?
BOIII, ON MY FUCKING WAY TO THE NEAREST TARGET RN TO CHECK IF THEY HAVE ONE
Time to ask my dad to help me buy some! üòé (broke high school student here)
Wonder if they will have adaptive panties for women who haven't had bottom surgery but still want to wear sexy silky panties? Please Target?
oh my god. good on them for starting on making up for all the years of their shitty pride merch.
As an ex employee I hate Target, but it's clearly not all bad!
Ive had a look under my country's target and can't seem to find them, what are they listed as?
What are binders ? For what purpose you use them ?
Serbia could neverüò•
I'm happy for all the guys that this will help. Target has been such a great ally. One of the few places I feel safe using the restroom at out in public.
That‚Äôs just awesome. I rarely go there but I went there two days ago and they had a pride section and I thought that was just so cool- I got a shirt from there. Is the binder in the pride section?
They are okay, but not a traditional binder. If you have a chest that is bigger than a B cup they will not make you anywhere near flat, but they do compress some. I wear mine on my none binding days to give my chest and ribs a break, usually with a baggy hoodie. Wouldn‚Äôt ever wear it with clothes that fit well. Just don‚Äôt expect it to be a true ‚Äúbinder‚Äù think more of a athletic compression shirt for just your chest area. Better than a sports bra, but not a full binder.
That's really cool!

I have a clarifying question, are binders sort of like a cropped diving suit top or like a tight sports bra? I've always wondered in general, those are just the comparisons I concidered as possibly being similar. I can't imagine it would be anything remotely like an underwire, that just sounds medieval
[removed]
I like that it says tomboy as well, makes it just a little more stealth
When tf are the gonna start selling gaff underwear now?
Where are the gaffs!!! ^<^
That brand sells 1 tucking bikini, it's okay, honestly just disappointing that they only have 1 tucking garment and it kind sucks because it says tomboy on the band lol still this Is so awesome! Now we just need tucking panties in stores lol
according to reviews, it‚Äôs not quite a binder. provides compression, but not on the same level as a proper binder. a decent compromise if you‚Äôve got a strict family, i suppose. should at the very least minimize appearance, and if you‚Äôve got a small enough chest size, it could flatten. but for larger racks this probably won‚Äôt do the trick. its great to see an available option though! hoping more products like this get added to shelves soon.
They also sell makeup targeted toward skin with thick beards.
That's so good. It'll be nice since I heard they aren't too tight and my chest area hurts easily with binders cause of me having fibromyalgia.
Even target is on our side. Nothing can stop us now!
*zooms to Target*
‚Äútomboy‚Äù gotta love it...
Cishet Male here:

Can binders be harmful?  I've learned that they can be, but not always (depending on various factors).  I assume it would be best to speak to your GP about binding concerning any possible negative side effects.  Every now and then I come across local posts in FB of newly out people, or people speaking on behalf, who are wondering about binding.  Of course, I revommend talking with GP first (an LGBTQ affirming GP) before attempting.


I just want to make sure the information I have is correct and not harmful.
Is there gender affirming shape wear for trans femmes tho?
While I'm happy to see this. I am concerned. Binders are awesomely affirming for trans masc people. I'm concerned tho that someone is going to get hurt, by buying one that's too tight or someone's well meaning mother will buy it for their kid thinking it's something else. I've always been told binders need to be fitted properly or else you risk getting hurt. And no offense to anyone working at Target, but I'm not going to trust a binder from Tyler who works there after school making 8$/hr
YOURE JOKING edit: y'all i meant this in a positive way help

[deleted]
I don't get it; aren't binders usually used for when women want to bind their breasts during exercises?
why do people have to put the word >!queer!< everywhere. it‚Äôs so hurtful to see
[removed]
Those are weird looking pants
Lol this isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúTarget is pro-trans!‚Äù. This is called capitalists finding a new market to sell more products too.
[removed]
I‚Äôve seen someone (a size large in Gc2b and got a large in this) try it on and it actually looked great! That‚Äôs so cool. Idk about it with larger chest sizes than a large but I know it looked really good and flat.
I hope Target is Australia have them, I‚Äôm dying for a new binder üôÉüôÉ PLEASE AUSTRALIAN TARGET
I gotta check out target
Target also released what their pride line is gonna be or at least some of it, the stuff other than the binders look pretty cool too. Some of it's cheesy af but they're definitely getting better at it. But selling stealth binders is definitely top tier awesome. Honestly seems like target is one of the first larger corp stores doing pride merch semi well.
:)
I‚Äôm pretty sure Target doesn‚Äôt exist in my country, but I‚Äôm still really happy for everyone who this‚Äôll help!
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
Ok, but what section are they in and what are they labeled as?
This is fantastic, big win and wonderful and I hope it‚Äôs only a sign of things to come, however, I have to point out that I laughed at first thinking this was some weird joke about people no longer using binders because of technology (like school/paper binders for holding looseleaf and yada yada) and now target had brought them back as some kind of hipster retro campaign.  Then I saw the picture.  So again, good for target but I had to address my immediate reaction to this.
this is the only reason i want to live in america
can target please come back to canada
There's no Target in Canada  and I buy my stuff online but damn, this made me tear up.
I have to see this for myself. I‚Äôm going to target this week. I need to see. I waited years to get a binder and if some other kid can get a binder earlier that‚Äôs an absolute win. I hope we all get more moments like this in the future. Trans fem, trans masc and non-binary
I‚Äôm not seeing them at my local target or binders specifically on their website :( they just have their sportsbras
Til tomboyx is being sold at target. Anyone know if there‚Äôs a difference in quality between what tomboyx sells online and what‚Äôs sold through target?  Because the target prices are hecka cheaper‚Ä¶
Omg I was so confused, there‚Äôs binders that hold paper and I thought this post was talking about school supplies. The binder in the picture confused me for a second. I was scrolling through all and didn‚Äôt see the subreddit.
That‚Äôs good stuff. Anything that gives folks a sense of belonging and acceptance is good in my book.
I love this for y‚Äôall :) seriously huge step. Now if trans fems could get our shoe sizes‚Ä¶.
TIL I need to find the nearest Target‚Ä¶ üò©
Apparently target has done pride right this year
Would they also have gaffs or something similar? I know that same brand sells tucking bikini bottoms.
damn maybe I should go, cause I can't find my binder
The fact they even ARE able to do this is incredible but the company doing it is just bullshitting, unfortunately. They tried to get a trans man to be in their woman's day photoshoot without telling him. It's tempting, ik, but don't support them. It's just rainbow capitalism
https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=tomboyx

Same but beige? https://www.target.com/p/pride-adult-tomboyx-compression-top-beige/-/A-84762516?preselect=84661009#lnk=sametab

Wonder if I'm seeing limited selection due to my home store.
I thought y'all were talking about office supplies...
Seeing the rollout of this year‚Äôs pride collection has been one of my favorite parts of working there so far. Like, you can tell they had actual queer people working on it. The bi shirt has fingerguns on it, and the swimwear they have coming out later this month looks like something I might actually be comfortable with wearing! A few days ago I was wearing [this shirt](https://www.target.com/p/pride-adult-queer-short-sleeve-t-shirt-white-xxl/-/A-84663808) while I was working and a woman complimented it. When I told her I got it there she said ‚ÄúOh wow! My sister needs inspiration. She needs to see that even in a place like Tennessee, there‚Äôs hope.‚Äù
Lmao imagine a conservative thinking it‚Äôs a sports bra
On mobile you can only see the tweet without clicking the image and I was so fucking confused. ""They have always sold binders, that's where I used to get school supplies from"".
I hope they also got those tucking things even tho I'm in Canada and target didn't last here... It's pretty impossible to find those tucking things and the 2 on amazon say for guys and crossdressing in the title which sucks
TomboyX has the best stuff. I'm glad to see that they are making a name for themselves.
Can Walmart? üòÇ‚ò†Ô∏è
There's no targets or anything in my country no binder for me :(
I was JUST at target. I got home 10 minutes ago, where the *fuck* were these?
I WANT
I didn't notice which sub this was and I spent way too long thinking ""Where the heck do you put the papers in this binder?
I didn't see the pic, and i envisioned a 3 ring binder and got so damn confused till I clicked in. 

Godspeed my friends.
Isnt that a sports bra?
I thought this post was about somebody losing their mind about discovering a sick Trapper Keeper at Target only to find out they've always sold 3 ring binders....
Was kinda confused at first thinking you were talking about like a 3 ring binder for paper. Lmao
this is amazing. now this raises a question for me.  


  
what can a trans girl get at a store?
Waiting to see republicans mad about this

""Target shouldn't sell binders that's the trans agenda we should make it illegal even though we don't think big gov should interfere with private businesses""
Way to go Target!
Big Amy Santiago energy. I love me some binders.
Why are binders related to acceptance? You need them to put your reports in them, right? Office articles. I don't understand üò•
I'm going to target and buying my trans guy friend a binder, idc if he already has one
pov you live in canada üßç
This is amazing now how about target sell some tucking underwear üòú
Aren't they gonna stop selling these when pride is over?
Goddamn I wish target did this when I was in high school yee many years ago. I‚Äôm not trans, but I‚Äôm a drag king and this would have helped my self confidence so damn much
Tomboy X
That‚Äôs nice I see that target is doing it to
I wonder if they also have pocket bras for the prosthetic breasts I am using until my breasts bud
I wish for all the trans folk that they had a wider selection but its still a HUGE step in the right direction. Unless of course the target i went to was just mostly sold out, which would be completely dope
Will I get banned for saying dude?
I saw this because of /all, and while not trans myself, my son is - and I love the idea of not having to order online now!  I just need to check if it's at the local Target here.

Thank you for cross-posting this!
Imagine being the kind of person who sees a post about acceptance and thinks, ""Well that's just *unacceptable*...""
I found it from r/all and was confused for a bit thinking binders was the school supply, like a 3 ring binder. But I was wrong, and that's awesome for anyone that needs them.
I‚Äôm from r/all as well. I had no idea what I was looking at.

Thanks for explaining it. And sharing it. 

I‚Äôm happy the world is becoming accommodating for everyone. 

Sorry it‚Äôs taking so long.

What is a binder exactly is this not just a sports bra?
I wouldn't have known what this was if I saw it in a store, but now that I know I'll feel a little ping of happiness when I see it knowing that it's making someone's life a little easier.
Same on this https://media3.giphy.com/media/ZwxpIHk5LutMc/giphy.gif?cid=8942bed4101085e7e24e7d14a1fb6034d4df95c30dc65629&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g
Also some people just like plain simple clothing. If every (or most) other brands only produce trans shouting clothing it is some kind of a market niche to sell plain simple clothing.
Yea as someone a bit closeted about my true gender and identity I would love to buy stuff that are plain and look like any other item in the store, im just embarassed and scared of hate if I would show interest in "" IM TRANS LOOK AT ME !!! ""  product, after all, everything I want is to feel comfy with myself and to feel like a normal person that's shopping and not some kind of alien that wants to buy some alien clothes for myself. Sorry if I choose wrong words idk how to express my point, I support trans people ofc im kinda unsure about my identity rn but I just would love to try a binder.
Tomboy misgenders their own models I wouldn't say theyre a decent brand
I, in fact, thought it was a sports bra.  Which probably will make it more accessible to some folks, so that's a win
From someone coming from /all, thanks for explaining what this is/does.
There are big supermarket chains equivalent to Walmart and target in the uk right? Hopefully they will implement this too in the near futureüôèüèª
Are you cool with shopping online? I know a Dutch website that sells them.
Asda and Walmart are owned by the same company so they might have some in the bigger stores the ones with a decent clothing section.
Walmart own Asda so that night be where to keep an eye out
[https://spectrumoutfitters.co.uk/](https://spectrumoutfitters.co.uk/) this is where I get mine :)
Wait it's also a good one? Part of me was worried that it was going to turn out to be somehow garbage that would, like, break your ribs or something. Sweet.
It's a very popular brand

I've only heard good things about them
I‚Äôve never gotten binders from tomboyx, but I LOVE their boxers!! So I can only imagine their binders are awesome too.
Transfemme from Seattle here (where Tomboyx was founded); they're outstanding. A+, that's where most of my underwear comes from.
Tomboyx certainly has had it‚Äôs fair share of controversy, from supporting police to treating trans models so disrespectfully.
I've been wearing their 9"" boxers for 3 or 4 years and really like them. I prefer the microfiber to the cotton and find it holds up better.  I have some swim too from clearance but I've only used it once (it was very nice).
I hope we get them in Australia too. I have one binder and it‚Äôs starting to get a bit ratty. Just checked the online store here and there isn‚Äôt even anything up for pride yet.
You could probably measure yourself. While the sizes may be different, gc2b has a tutorial on their website.
Target fitting room isnt supposed to measure for bras, just direct you to a fitting tool on the website.  Same would apply to this.  If you're lucky and ask nice there might be a measuring tape lying around in their drawer
Binders are for those who don‚Äôt want their boobies to be visible (by flattening them). Like trans men (and possibly closeted trans women)
They're something that many AFAB trans people wear to compress their chest (and usually to make a more masculine/Androgynous appearance). They can be hard to come by for trans youth, especially if they have an unnacepting household, but binders being sold at target makes them so much more accessible.
So am I and was also wondering, thanks for asking.
I don‚Äôt know where else to post this because it‚Äôs not really relevant to anything, but I said something similar to my wife the other day after watching ‚ÄúThe Eternals.‚Äù  It feels like there‚Äôs tons of media that depicts gay men in relationships, but hardly anything showing lesbian relationships.  And to your point, you often hear about trans women in news or whatever, but rarely anything about trans men. So I agree, it‚Äôs cool to see a store do something for a group of people that I think don‚Äôt get a lot of representation or support anywhere.
I do know that binders have been available in Japan for quite some time. Cosplay is a huge thing over there. I know they‚Äôre in a lot of the cosplay stores but aside from that idk
Yeah, they‚Äôre like $25
I actually just found a binder at a thrift store and got it a few hours ago for $3. It was in the ""women's swimwear"" section (ugh). If you're ok with browsing those sections, you might find a very affordable binder.
I really like Underworks, I also recommend a full length binder not a short one like bra-style one pictured, I find they create a flatter shape.
I clocked in at about a 34K (US sizing) before I just quit wearing bras, and I prefer Underworks over gc2b. Full tank is my go-to, for example [something like this](https://www.underworks.com/the-cotton-lined-power-chest-binder-tank), which has compression the whole way down, because with garments like a [half binder](https://www.underworks.com/tri-top-chest-binder) or a [tank with shorter compression panel](https://www.underworks.com/cotton-concealer-chest-binder), my boobs will kinda fall out of the bottom a bit when I get them pressed flat enough, due to volume. 

I do have a cotton tank with a shorter panel that I still wear sometimes, but I'm about to repurchase some longer ones, since I've changed sizes.
I'm a DDD and I use GC2B
I have a large chest, and my binder is from GC2B, and it works really well. But, I got it a year and a half ago, and I‚Äôve heard their quality has dropped significantly since then. But, I haven‚Äôt bought from them recently so I couldn‚Äôt confirm nor deny that.
I had a 32DDD and liked my half tank from Underworks best. Also had a GC2B full but in medium (which was the recommended size from the chart) and the compression was insufficient imo, and the quality of the binder wasn‚Äôt as good too (seams started giving out after just a few months). I wasn‚Äôt too much into the full tank because I live in the desert and that was hot as fuck but the half tank definitely meant I had to readjust by pulling on it regularly because my chest would try to escape from the bottom... üíÄ but if you have a large cup on a small torso, I recommend going one size down from the charts.
Hm I think the name works for stealth
Why's that? They also sell tucking panties amongst other gender affirming items, they have lots of options not just trans specific. I'm not 100% but from the article I read it was founded by women. the creator could identify as a tomboy perhaps? Either way I'm glad to see my FtM friends easier access to binders
Some trans men and non-binary folks use them to hide/minimize their breasts. This allows them to present in a way that's more compatible with their gender.

Some trans women that have started hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use them to hide/minimize their breasts if they may not be out yet. The estrogen is likely causing their breasts to grow, among other changes. While this is the goal, it can cause problems (safety, housing, employment, etc.) for MTF trans folks that aren't out yet.
They're used by people to make their chest look flat, usually to help with chest dysphoria or staying stealth even when on hrt. I don't know exactly how they work, but to me wearing a binder feels kinda like a tight sports bra
Typically they work similar to a sports bra but have a non-stretch panel on the front to flatten the chest. They can be somewhat tight and uncomfortable but for those of us with chest dysphoria they are literally the only way I feel comfortable being in public.
Did they?
The brand ‚ÄòTomboyx‚Äô (shown here) also have tucking panties, so it could be possibleü§ûüèª
If your talking about Australian Target they are totally unrelated companies. These would only be sold in the US.

I'm MTF, so I don't know most of the details, but here's a similar post from a few weeks ago...

https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/u58qw3/how\_does\_a\_binder\_work/
How is it stealth to have a word that means a type of woman or girl on it? I wouldn‚Äôt wear this specifically because it uses that word and I‚Äôm not even a trans man I‚Äôm non-binary.
Not if used correctly. Binding in general can be harmful if done with the wrong tools (i.e. ACE bandages, which is annoyingly the only way binding is ever shown in media) and binders should generally not be worn beyond eight hours or while sleeping or exercising (you can bind while exercising but use a loose binder or one a size larger). 

Checking a GP is always a good idea but binding is fairly low risk. It‚Äôs like starting an exercise regimen, you should check first, most people don‚Äôt though and are fine.
TomboyX makes a tucking panty in a [bunch of colors](https://tomboyx.com/products/tucking-ruby?_pos=3&_sid=4ac52e8f3&_ss=r), but that's it. Other companies make bras and panties with additional padding for a more feminine appearance, though they're not, apparently, at Target.
Not at Target.
This is a big win for people who are closeted! It's fairly accessible, isn't obviously LGBTQ+ at first glance, and fairly affordable. Of course, there are risks, but this is often someone's only option.
These are compression tops rather than binders, not as tight i believe. Also they aren't made by Target, they are being sold there

No.

Don't steal from target. This isn't a moral ""you shouldn't shoplift it's bad!"" Message but target has really good security and *will* fuck your shit up *when* they catch you.
Binders are *mostly* used by trans men or non-binary folks to visually minimize their breasts under clothing so that they present in a way that more aligns with their gender.

I think you‚Äôre confusing binders with sports bras. They‚Äôre a little similar but have different uses/purposes/target audiences.
The LGBTQ+ community is actually reclaiming the word now! Generally now it's used as an umbrella word for LGBTQ+ community. It's fine if you're uncomfortable though, as it was/can still be used offensively.
WE own that word now; this isn't new. Here's a great explanation of what happened:

[https://www.cjr.org/language\_corner/queer.php](https://www.cjr.org/language_corner/queer.php)
You should work on that, because queer has become normalized for most of the community.
Wow your prejudice needs to be removed from this world as it‚Äôs so hurtful to see.
Yes like (fortunately) most people do. Not sure what that has to do with this post though?
I think pickles are good.
Yes, and no.

**Yes:** Their primary goal is to return money to their shareholders, and they're [definitely doing that](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TGT/target/revenue).

**No:** This isn't without risk, as there are still people squawking about Target's [bathroom policy](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/target-single-stall-bathrooms_n_57b4b6bfe4b0fd5a2f40dee8). And this definitely isn't [Hobby Lobby](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2021/08/15/hobby-lobby-loses-11-year-fight-to-block-trans-woman-from-bathroom/?sh=1fe40510c3a7), so things could be MUCH worse than unbridled capitalism.

It‚Äôs not yet at all targets and I‚Äôm not certain how effective it is at being a binder. TomboyX just makes non-gendered undergarments and swimsuits. They are available on their own website if you can‚Äôt find them in your local store.
Your son is so lucky to have a loving and supportive parent who stands by him, so many of us in the LGBTQ+ community don't have that... thank you for doing better for him.

Can someone help me out? I don't know what a binder is. Please excuse my ignorance; I'm not trans so I really don't know
A binder compresses a lot more making the chest visibly flat.
It's useful for AFAB (assigned female at birth) folk who are transmasc or nonbinary, and want to compress or ""bind"" the chest area (as OP mentioned). It can help with body/gender dysphoria.
So you basically say as a (potential) trans person you want clothes that don't shout trans. Just like cis persons don't want clothes that shout cis or gay persons clothes that don't shout gay. So something completely normal. You want clothes and not a wearable statement. Absolutely nothing wrong with your words.
And then blocks people who try to speak about it. Sad day. I just wish everyone had easy access to clothing options like this.
Oh goddammit
yeah, i hope so.
Asda is a big supermarket owned by Walmart

I like their binders bc they have more gentle compression, which might not work out for some people but I like having an intermediate between normal binder and sports bra
They‚Äôre ‚Äúcompression tops‚Äù, not actual binders since they don‚Äôt fit as tightly, but they are great if you have a smaller chest. From my experience, the straps on the TomboyX compression tops don‚Äôt ride as high as the ones on GC2B binders, so they‚Äôre less likely to show through the neck hole in shirts.
Australian Target has zero relation to American target aside from the name.
Gc2b also has an amazing return policy. We ordered basically every size to figure out what fit my son best and were able to return and exchange them super easily until he found the size that fit best.
[deleted]
Is that painful?
That makes much more sense.

I remember watching skins about 15 years ago and one of them were wrapping themselves in bandages but it makes sense that there's an actual item
Also here from r/all. Do the compress more than a sports bra would? I imagine its not as easy if you have a larger chest. 

Glad theyre offering needed items :)

Edit: thank you for the knowledge!
Why possibly closeted trans women? Genuinely curious, also here from r/all
Oh, that makes more sense. I was confused thinking y'all were talking about school binders and knowing that couldn't be right.

Yep! I've always wanted to be able to help a trans guy learn how to do man stuff, to pay the kindness forward for a trans man who helped me learn tons about behaving like a girl. I mean, I help the girls too, but yknow. Much love for the fellas. :)
Nice thinking. As mtf I never considered cosplay outlets.
Omg!!!!! Yayyyyy I can buy my own binders now :>
OH MY GOSH YES
Omg that‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôll try it sometime :D
(I‚Äôm sorry if this is an invasive question) how well does it bind?
Why would a stealth trans man wear something with a name that means a particular type of girl though? I don‚Äôt think that works for stealth at all, quite the opposite.
Tomboy tends to mean woman who has ""boyish"" characteristics. it isn't trans specific.
That makes sense!  Thanks for the info!  Still learning about all of this as it has become quite a topic as of late and trying to wrap my head around all the cool new info I get to learn!

Have an awesome evening/day/whatever it is for you!
i asked my mom if we could go to target and she said no... ;-; so i don't know
I hope. Who doesn't want silky panties!? Soft. Feminine. Beautiful. But so hard to find good ones.
Yeah I spent a while researching and figured it out. sucks that we don't have it yet, Thank you anyway tho!
Thank you so much.

I had a lot more to say about how I feel for the trans community, but after writing and re-writing my comment, I felt that, regardless of what it was I wanted or was trying to say, had the potential of being insulting to someone in some way, due to my own ignorance. 

I just want you, and all others, to know you have my support. My own understanding, or anyone's for that matter, has nothing to do with making a person feel accepted, valid, and safe.

Love you all.
I didn‚Äôt mean stealth like that, I meant as in if you‚Äôre not out to your parents for example
Got it!  Thank you for the corrected information!
Ahh okay. I was a little worried. This is a little more reaffirming
[removed]
But like also you shouldn‚Äôt shoplift either. 

If the products go out in an unpaid fashion the store could stop carrying them. Wouldn‚Äôt THAT look bad?
I don't really get what the functional difference between the two is - oh well!
i‚Äôm saying from personal experience i NEVER hear it positively in real life. only negative and as an insult. maybe that‚Äôs not the case everywhere but please don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs reclaimed everywhere.
it‚Äôs a slur, full on and anyone that‚Äôs called that is part of that community. not lgbt, that‚Äôs seperate and we aren‚Äôt a slur
wow so i dont want to hear a hurtful slur and that makes me prejudicied?
[removed]
Read that comment to yourself, think really hard about it, and if you see nothing wrong with what you just commented, go into your bathroom, look into a mirror and slap yourself and, hopefully, begin to realise how fucked up that question sounds, regardless of context.
What the fuck is wrong with you???
I did understand that part, did you perchance reply to the wrong comment?
A Binder, in this sense, is used by people with breasts who wish to appear more flat chested. 

Think like an old fashioned girdle, that old fat guys wore to look skinnier, but for boobs.
Does that hurt?
Have you used TomboyX merch? I thought they just made non-gendered undergarments for afab people. I‚Äôm not sure how effective their stuff is as a binder.
*dysphoria
Yes but I don't speak english well and had people wishing me death because they didnt understand what I meant few times, so now when I say my opinion about something more vulnerable I always say I cant find right words because mostly that is true lol
Maybe they'll get them at tesco
[here you go](https://www.trans-missie.com/en/he-they/)

I use their correcting underwear (for MtF) and it works really well at hiding my bits. Hopefully the binders work just as well.
Amazon sells this binder in the uk
Also kept misgendering the model even though they were corrected multiple times if I remember correctly
[deleted]
Unfortunately their quality has gone downhill as they've expanded. Last two binders I've bought from them have both ripped at the seams in such a way that my right boob sneaks out of compression if I lift my arms. 

Still, they are the least worst company I have ever bought binders from. Gotta be hard staying in business while serving such a small demographic and trying to do all the ethical things right.
That‚Äôs for the goths who like sleeping upside down /s
It can be if not using them correctly. (Like proper sizing and wearing them too long at a time is also not good)
It does (apparently - transfem without boobs here, so no say in the matter) apparently get uncomfortable, but a lot of people (especially trans men/transmasculine non-binary people) choose that over the discomfort of visible boobs.

There are limits to it though - It's highly recommended/a rule not to bind during sports or for longer than 8 hours as excessive binding can cause rib damage.
If not sized properly, yes. However, a good fitting one generally just feels snug.
It can be for the ribs or shoulders in the circumstances the other comment said
yeah, bandages are actually really dangerous to bind with, they can cause broken ribs and stuff
Yeah ace bandages are for compression, too. Meaning movement can constrict them further causing injuries so we usually try to steer people away from bandage binding.
They do compress significantly more. It is harder to bind with a larger chest but in general, binders do a better job than a sports bra. They don't make the chest completely flat because that would be painful, but rather shape it to look more masculine and generally looks like pecs + ideally with a shirt on hides it completely.
Yes, they have a non-stretch panel at the front (typically) to flatten more than a all-stretch sports bra would. Having a larger chest definitely makes it more of a pain in the ass; but some folks and some binders are pretty successful at flattening.
I used to bind and I had L cups and passed as a cis guy to people I was living with. It‚Äôs not the easiest thing but it is possible for people with larger chests.
If they've started hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the estrogen is likely causing their breasts to grow, among other changes. While this is the goal, it *can* cause problems (safety, housing, employment, etc.) for MTF trans folks that aren't out yet.
Some trans women live in places where it's very frowned upon to be their true self, so they'll be presenting as a ""boy"" to remain safe. They don't want their breasts to become noticable to family and friends.
Estrogen makes you grow breasts. If you don't want your family to know you're transitioning (frequently necessary for safety reasons), binders can hide the changes
They are different from sports bras, in that they're specifically made to compress and conceal the chest. Plus, sports bras often dont work as compression for people with a bigger chest (or a smaller one, for that matter) at least in my experience. Going down a size can be really uncomfortable and also probably isn't safe in some cases, and it's usually just better to get a garment made for compressing that wont hurt or feel bad to wear. But you're right, a common way to bind when someone is unable to get a binder is wearing a sports bra, either one size down, backwards, or any other method that people have found works.
They don't really work the same at all. Binders can make the users chest *flat* flat.
Absolutely not, and very please not do that.
I've done this and the double sports bra thing. It doesn't compress that much at the desired area, but the under-bust area gets heavily compressed and it's hard to breathe. From what I've seen, binders don't compress that part of your chest so you have less breathing issues.  (don't have one yet because they're kinda hard to find at my country)
Wearing a sports bra in a smaller size just makes the boobs pop out weirdly on the sides/top, and is also painful and leaves red marks on the shoulder strap area. Source: myself not having money to buy new bras when I needed them, lol
I'm actually really very happy for you.
Around a B cup, which is ~3 (I'm not good at math) sizes down.
Think a closeted trans man who's stealthing as a ""tomboyish girl"" to their unaccepting family/community
I'm not sure what part of this confuses you, but since this appears to be sincere, I'm just going to explain as thoroughly as I can:

If someone assigned female at birth who identifies as male wants to control their gender dysphoria with having a flatter chest, but aren't allowed by their parents or are feel afraid to openly purchase things that help them pass as masculine, then having a name that has boy in it but invokes a 'type of girl' may help with discreet purchases, so that people think you're just buying a feminine piece of clothing, like a sport's bra.

Granted, the inverse is also viable, a trans woman might buy this particular binder as a way to flatten her chest to remain closeted in public while she's on HRT and still going through changes until she can pass more effectively. It's possible they meant to be inclusive, even if it comes off as a bit clumsy.

While it would be nice not to *need* stealth at all, trans people are still victims of many violent crimes (including sexual assaults, murder, multiple forms of child abuse) at this point in time, so in certain families / certain areas, being discreet is simply a matter of survival.

I, for example, come from a family that considers being part of the LGBTQ+ in any form to be potential grounds for threats of being assaulted, shot, and ultimately being labeled an insane sexual deviant for the rest of your life.
I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs the purpose. Like, labeling it something that isn‚Äôt trans specific as to not raise questions.
Tomboyx isn't a trans specific brand either, any queer can enjoy their clothes, which lean tomboy-ish. They just also have trans related clothing like binders and such.
Yeah Im aware, I didn't indicate that? Sorry if thats how it came off lol, but I actually do identify as an MtF tomboy coincidentally! I edited the original comment because I thought about and could see how someone could thing I was being trans exclusive
That‚Äôs closeted not stealth, but it would be great for closeted people.

Edit: https://translifeline.org/resource/glossary-of-terms-definitions/
Why is it sad?

Sports bras aren‚Äôt made to flatten; they kinda do as a side effect but that‚Äôs not the goal. The goal of a sports bra is to keep things from moving around. They‚Äôre fully elastic all the way around and do the work of a bra (lift and separate though ymmv with different bras/boobs) while also keeping things locked in place so they don‚Äôt jiggle or move painfully. They kind of creat pockets for the chest to sit in; even if the bra doesn‚Äôt have literal pockets. It usually does this with a tighter base band and upwards compression that lifts and contains.

Binders are build to compress and flatten. They‚Äôre not elastic all the way around and have a somewhat different structure in general. They typically have a non-stretch panel on the front and have a downward/perpendicular pressure that flattens and spreads chest tissue to keep it as flat as possible.  They‚Äôre also very much not built to be exercised in and it‚Äôs not recommended to do so (if you plan to bind while working out; you need to wear a size larger for safety). 

Basically sports bras are made for contained movement; binders made for pure compression.
I'm not speaking for everyone, but I use it semi-frequently. A few recent examples that come to mind...

\- **In the queer section:** When the clerk at my local comic book shop asked where I picked up a graphic novel I was buying.

\- **I just say queer:** When a hetero person complained to me about their confusion around the meaning of ""LGBTQ+"".

\- **I LOVE being queer!**: When talking to a trans girlfriend about how happy I've been since coming out last year:)

I'm old, old enough to remember the beginning of the HIV/AIDS crisis. I was just \*barely\* starting to start coming to terms with my gender and sexuality, and I remember how brave and powerful the folks at ACT UP were. They stood up for themselves (and the future me:)) when no one else would. NO ONE. It's because they shouted ""We're here! We're queer! Get used to it!"" that we all have as many rights and freedoms as we do.

Edit: fixed a bunch of shitty Reddit fuckery.
It's not a slur. It *used* to be a slur but it's been fully reclaimed. You don't have to be comfortable using the term queer or identifying as queer, but you cannot stop others from using it.
[removed]
Well thanks I guess?
No, I was trying to make a joke since you referenced school binders instead of chest binders.  Trapper keepers were a brand of school binders super popular in the old days, aka the 90s‚Ä¶
Ah, I see. Thanks!
Yes. The dysphoria and danger that not passing would put me in is worse, though.
It's not recommended to wear it for too long (> 8 hours a day?) because it could damage ribs. idk if it hurts though
It depends, it usually hurts after a certain amount of time, but it's different for everyone. A lot of people get back problems and breathing problems when they're wearing their binder. If done incorrectly, you can actually break your ribs, afaik. The safe practice is to wear a binder as little as possible and up to 8-10 hours a day. It's best to skip a day at least once a week, but that's not possible for everyone
Not when done properly.
I‚Äôm just a sister supporting my brothers‚ù§Ô∏è

There are however plenty of comments on here that discuss the pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs of different brands. I‚Äôm positive we have the best experts among usüí™üèª
Even if they are not the ‚Äúmost effective‚Äù, which I‚Äôm not saying their not, the option for a person who needs one to be able to buy one at a big retailer is HUGE. Small Wins Equal Great Success
I have sensory and anxiety issues that make traditional binders impossible to wear. The tomboy X stuff pictured in this post is about as close as I can get to binding. It's by no means a complete reduction, but it's really good, and are less tight
I haven't used their stuff yet but they have had gender affirming clothes on they're site for awhile now. They're also one of the main brands I find when searching for binders on Amazon, so if your looking for reviews on their products maybe start there.
Thanks, edited it now :)
Understandable. I already encountered something like this at least 2 times (were it was quite clear that it is just a problem of language). Especially when it comes to proverbs and the exact same phrase is used for 2 completely different meanings in 2 different languages it can be quite nerve-wracking.
Man I hope
It's a bot account. They commonly do that to farm karma for a bit until they start shilling crypto-scams or onlyfans.
Trans Batman confirmed?
^ This. It should not be painful or that means something is wrong, I've seen people seem to imply it's always painful which is not right at all. Ideally it should not be uncomfortable, but it is a constricting piece of clothing so it depends on your tolerance.
Rib damage!? That sounds way too intense üòñ
Ooh that makes sense, thank you!
Ooh that makes sense, thank you
Interesting, thanks!
That‚Äôs called being closeted. Stealthing is when you‚Äôre living as your true gender and not disclosing that you are trans to anyone. Honestly, are the kids missing out on basic trans 101 terminology these days? There have been multiple people who are very confused about the difference between stealth and the closet.
That‚Äôs not stealth, that‚Äôs closeted.

Stealth is when someone has transitioned and moved away from everyone who knew them prior to their transition and they live as the gender they are without disclosing the fact that they are trans. Someone who is stealth would not want any clothing that could suggest their AGAB, which is why this is the opposite of something that works for stealth.

Closeted is when someone understands their transgender identity but has not or is not able to transition yet and has to hide who they are from others. 

It would be nice not to need stealth or the closet at all, as someone who has had to live both and is much happier now that I‚Äôm able to live openly as who I am. 

https://translifeline.org/resource/glossary-of-terms-definitions/
yeah that could be.
I kind of forgot stealth is a term in the trans community already, I‚Äôm sorry for the confusion!
From this person's comment history, they're at the very least a troll, and most likely transphobic.
[removed]
simple fact is i‚Äôm not. being trans doesn‚Äôt make me different (or at least shouldn‚Äôt) so it is directly contrary to me to use the word or use it to apply to being trans in general (if someone wants to use it alone, that‚Äôs a different story) but the other issue is that in my region no one would call themselves that. it‚Äôs an insult first and foremost in many regions and it is very hurtful to hear people use it and trans interchangbly.
lol where tf do you live that it‚Äôs been fully reclaimed? and i can absolutely ask others not to use it
im going to assume you are joking
Ohhhhh lol I understand now. I had forgotten trapper keeper was a thing.
The will power I require to not go batshit crazy over reading ''among us'' on a serious post


I apologise
That's only if you overdo it a lot, and more of a long-term thing. Your average trans dude who binds won't have consequences from it.

EDIT: For the record, **always bind safely**. Even if you get dysphoria from not binding, it's better to be safe than sorry.
Ahh my bad. I didn't use stealth as the trans term, I used it literally as stealthy selling/marketing so sorry for the confusion!!
>It would be nice not to need stealth or the closet at all, as someone who has had to live both and is much happier now that I‚Äôm able to live openly as who I am.

This is actually making me reconsider going into stealth in the future. (This time I'm using the trans sense of stealth).
*Oh*.

So the issue wasn't general confusion, it was a disagreement of terms used, because you're using ***specifically*** the trans term ""stealth"" as opposed to the *literal* term 'stealth,' as in 'cautious actions'... cool.

I wish more of us had that, to live like you do now.
It‚Äôs just the patriarchy trying to keep us down by hiding our history from us, not your fault :)
Yeah, I should have caught that; just removed it.
[removed]
and besides the initial points, i find grsm works just fine. it‚Äôs like a white person asking what it means to be a certain race and replying it‚Äôs being (fill in racial slur for that group) I am NOT different for being trans and i reject the idea that being trans makes us different. we are peopoe just like cis people and we aren‚Äôt different by virtue of that
You can buy a doormat at Target that says ""You're Here, I'm Queer"".   
  
idk what else to tell you it's been reclaimed and normalized.
[removed]
Sadly, according to a poll of 1273 participants, it isn't all perfect (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6298447/).

77.7% (989) reported having skin issues
74.8% (952) reported feeling pain due to binding at least once, and 39.1% (498) noted that this pain was severe.

This is not to say it does not have mental benefits; although, as a transfem, I can not verify firsthand. 57.2 (728) said they binded every day, so it obviously has not discouraged them.

All I can say is PLEASE be safe and take breaks every so often to help mitigate risk exposure.

I would like to reiterate: I am not against binding, nor am I trying to discourage anyone. I have many transmasc friends who I am happy to see happy; I just want to ensure that everyone is aware that it is not without risks, so minimizing risk exposure is key. With that, be safe if you do bind or are going to bind.
That's what I assumed you meant, too! Which is why I explained things the way I did, lol--I didn't get that FinalFaction was only using the trans term.
Stealth was particularly wrong for me because I‚Äôm non-binary, trying to cram my identity into the box of ‚Äúman‚Äù made me realize that even though it was a better fit than the ‚Äúwoman‚Äù box it still didn‚Äôt fit all of me. Sometimes I‚Äôve found I have to try things out to know whether they feel right or not.
Yeah I should've used another word lmao
*Looks around at the subreddit we are in*

Yeah, real cool.
i mean again, you can use a word that‚Äôs hurtful to a lot of us as much as you want. i can‚Äôt stop you.
""Cool"" as in ""we understand each other now and are on the same page, I getchu fam"" kind of 'cool', if that wasn't clear.

I don't know if you noticed this, but ***a lot*** of people came to this post from another, non-trans subreddit (due to it being somehow linked through that one?) and were asking a bunch of basic, trans related, ""I'm new to the concept of why binders are needed"" type questions, and you don't have flare, so that might explain the way this played out. (Like; my assumption that they were using stealth by the traditional definition, not the trans definition *was* accurate, I was just wrong about the reason you were asking, lol.)"	ul0r7c	trans	8562	0.89	2022-05-08 12:34:51

What beautiful brides
I had a problem about gay marriage. Het couples get bride and broom. Male gay couples have to brooms with male suits. Then thinking about lesbian couples I was wondering about how the brides dress, and I was so confused as I didn't want to lose hope about wearing the white dress, but at the same time I didn't want to shatter my partner's dream (if they will be female, as I am pretty much a lesbian but also confused to that regard, I will find out with time).

Looking at you two with the dress of your dreams, makes me very happy for you and reassures me. Congrats!!! <3333333333
Pretty dresses!! Gorgeous! Happy for you two!!
My problem with these pics is I can‚Äôt decide who‚Äôs dress I like better!
Your dresses are so beautiful!!!
You look so cute together :3
Congrats! Those smiles y‚Äôall have! Made me smile!
Congratulations! You both look so beautiful :)
Congratulations. Picked a beautiful day to get hitched. It proves love is out there. Wish you both a prosperous and fun filled life ahead. Congratulations again..
Congrats!!!!!!!
Congrats!
Congrats, my dream ‚ù§Ô∏è
Two princesses become two queens. Beautiful.
Thank you! No, we will never back down, no matter what :)
Thank you for your service and for fighting for our right to live in peace and happiness as we are. My father is a veteran as well, you have my utmost respect!
I am not a vet but I am a Texan, and this feller here said it best! This freedom is what makes us proud. Your love makes us all happy.
We absolutely are my wife didn‚Äôt hesitate for a single second to embrace me when I came out back in late 2020, I proposed just 2 months after because I knew she was the one. Everyone in attendance was loving and supportive of us, truly the best day of my life :)
I would highly recommend the do over because you deserve to have your bridal photos together :). My wife was so amazing allowing us to have a longer engagement to give my HRT about 24 months to get working. She agrees the wait was worth it!
Same!! I want everyone to know that I married REAL NAME, after they knew I married deadname. He deserves to wear a suit, NOT a white dress in our wedding photos! (I somehow escaped dysphoria)
We stan two girls bein gays ü•πüò≠
Thank you so much! We really felt like princesses :)
Hell yeah it is
Thank you!!!
There was another post in r/all that asked what did MAGA steal from you. For me it's the honor of my service. I did NOT fight for hate.
You are living the dream, girl!"	12attqd	trans	4547	0.94	2023-04-03 18:50:52

üíñüíñüíñ Happy Birthday üíñüíñüíñ
Aaaaa I‚Äôm so confused. You‚Äôre so gorgeous, and I don‚Äôt know if it makes me 1) want to be a prettier cis woman, 2) want to transition to being male while I‚Äôm still young so that I can get similar results, or 3) want to go out and date a woman. Why is figuring this stuff out so hard? I see pretty women and part of me wants to look like them, but at the same time, I absolutely despise my own body and wish I was tall and flat chested and NOT a girl.

Anyway you look absolutely radiant. That‚Äôs all.
Are you winning so....... *checks notes* are you winning daughter?

Okay rq question, why yenny? Just wondering since I haven't heard of it for a name before

You're Awesome!
Nooo I'm a Yenny.
Hope you have a great day!
It's not the gender thats radiating, it's the joy!

It took me 20 years to come to terms with who I was. I only realized after getting into LGBT communities why it is that I wanted to be, well, me? Sure, I thought about being a woman and having a woman's body, but thats just a me thing, right? On GNC/trans support day in highschool, I crossdressed in full purple, shaved my legs, presented entirely female and half jokingly told people to call me Jessica. Whenever people asked me why, I would just look at them blankly while someone else wpuld say ""That's just Deadname being Deadname. Or Jessica, I guess?"" 

These sorts of feels are all super complicated. If I were a cis woman, I'd probably have different Dysmorfias than I do now.   There is a lot of pressure, cis, trans and otherwise to be a certain way. It doesnt JUST come from within. 

My advice? Try things out! I feel like Gender (capital G) is a lot more fluid and flexible than people make it out to be. Both cis and trans, there seems to be a very rigid idea that you have to ""Pick something and stick with it.""

But that's not true. Come on. We both know it. The problem is that transitioning, detransitioning, experimenting with sex and gender or otherwise not sticking to one thing is really stigmatized against. If it feels right for me in the moment to be a woman, then I will be.

If, sixty years from now, for whatever unthinkable reason I want to be a rocking-chair grandpa then that's what I'll be. But I want to be a woman! I missed out on being a girl, but I also go to be a boy. And it wasn't awful, untill I realized that being a man just wasn't it for me. Yet, being a man was the standard order of things.

To go down your list:
1) I mean, if you want to LOOK like a prettier cis woman, then go for it! That's super valid. Cis people being comfy in their gender and enthusiastic about it is so inspiring.

2) Sounds complicated - try to isolate what it is that you'd want to achieve with something like that. Clothes can do a lot for how your body looks. In the face, surgery can totally be a fun aesthethic thing. I feel like its healthier to think of it that way too. Stuff is getting safer as we do it more, too! Get cheek implants if you want to!  I know I have a big list of maybes to work through.

3) Try it! Women are awesome. Source: am a woman.
It's not for everyone though üòã


My partner is nonbinary. They present female most of the time, but also want to be taller or flatter at times, etc. etc. Consider a binder if you havent, but realize that your body is beautiful in and out of it. If it makes you feel BAD to look womanly, then don't! If it makes you feel BAD to be a woman because of how women are treated...

Well, hek, tell me about it, how crazy do I have to be to want to be one! But that's not a YOU thing. That's a society thing. Take your time, there is plenty. It's never too late and I highly encourage you to experiment.
My parents like the letter Y.  


So, all their children had a funny Y in their name somewhere. For the first three it made sense. Then, when they named me, it made absolutely no sense. My deadname was never, ever spelled correctly. I would always have to explain to people that my name was spelled differently. The only place my deadname was ever spelled properly was in a starbucks. That should tell you enough.  


So, when considering my chosen name (and having my sister veto the ones that sound too much like stripper names, because she's the fun police in our familly.) I landed on Jenny, as in the song with the videoclip that features shapeshifting lesbians by studio killers. As a peace offering towards my parents, I kept the second Y in there!  


I don't know, it kind of builds character? That, and my name sounds like Generous when you say it a few times fast! And that's pretty cool to me. I liked it! I never really hated deadme. I just didn't really want to be him anymore. He did a pretty good job at being annoying, now it's my time to be pleasant instead. The Y persists!
I'm not sure if you can define wholesome, but I've definitely gotten used to my life making more sense by trying to define things. Lets try it.  


if the definition of wholesome is capable of empathy and well intentioned, maybe it's because I can empathize with people who are in shitty situations because I have a track record of being in a lot of shitty situations.  


If the definition of wholesome is self-aware and respectful, maybe it's because I recognize that I am doing pretty swell and that other people who are doing less swell might not feel as great.   


If the definition of wholesome is maintaining a positive outlook on life, maybe it's because I have personally seen it get better. God, does it get better.  


If the definition of wholesome is conducive towards good health and physical well being, maybe it's because I'm a biology nerd who reminds people to hydrate and sleep well.   


Reminder to get a glass of water before you keep on reading, kind stranger. You know your body needs it, even if you don't like your body all that much.  


If the definition of wholesome is of upstanding moral character, then it's definitely because I looked like jesus pre-transition. Source: 90 year old kroatians commented on my likeness.   


Oh and yeah I've been doing CG stuff I posted my routine somewhere sometime recently. Aunt Jackie's is awesome stuff! Not Sponsored!
Its a lot of grooming and maintaining.
Thank youu!
Ya!!
Smh not jeluous at all...
do you just stand there and slowly look closer like when you encounter a mesmer in subnautica
That‚Äôs an uno reverse card situation
Oh no.
No it‚Äôs yellow with white stripes üôÑ
I thought it was ‚ÄòYnney‚Äô which kinda seems like it‚Äôs pronounced the same
dutch-dar
YASSSSS
It‚Äôs your bday?
Ooooh! Okay lol that is actually a really cool origin story! I actually never realized that it's pronounced jenny, I thought it was pronounced yen (like the Japanese currency) - ye (like as in yeee as like the meme) and I was super confused! Lol.

But thank you so much for explaining! Lol go forth with you and your weird siblings Y- names! 

Ooh! May I ask some examples of your parents names for their kids? Or maybe what was some of the stripper-y names that your sister shot down? You seem to have plenty of fun stories to tell!
Unpopular opinion but jealousy is a fine emotion.

It just means that you really, really want something. It's not spite. It's not malicious. It isn't something you can even really control. I experience it too, all the time! Even when it makes absolutely no sense. I think it's something society has deeply ingrained in (trans) women - people look like this. Then it pressures you into doing it too.

But remember that it's not about being pretty, it's about being happy. I have a loving familly and partner because I didn't take shit from anyone and only kept people around that treated me as a worthy human being. You don't envy me for being pretty, you're jealous. I sometimes feel like I haven't struggled enough or something, but I think it just means things are getting better for us as a whole. And I promise to you, I will do my absolute best every single day to be the best version of myself I can be.
I mean, It's pronounced Jenny but I'm just quirky.

That being said people do pronounce it the way you said it and I kind of don't care.
27th of may is my birth day, my cake day is 17 of may and my HRT anniversary is 1st of june :)

So it's been one big birthday!!
I'm so happy for you, you seem to be an amazing person who knows how to avoid toxicity and stay happy ^¬∞^
Sorry to be pedantic, but the feeling you're describing is envy, which is often mistakenly called jealousy. Jealousy is the fear that someone will take something that is yours. Envy is wanting something that someone else has.
Not only am I jealous of how beautiful you are, but I am also jealous of your friends that get to go shopping and hang out with you. You seem very genuine. I am happy that you have all these loving people in your life. You really do deserve it ‚ù§Ô∏è
I was imagining a drunk Arthur Morgan looking for his good pal Lenny after loosing him at the bar.
Ohh how nice! Welll one big congratulations from me!!
The same goes to you! Thanks for the kind words stranger ‚ù§Ô∏è

Yaaaay! I'm happy for you!!
I seriously wish that trans people could trade chests.  Congrats though.  If anyone has tips on breast plates please message me.  I'm asking for a non trans friend who wants to have a bigger chest and I wanna help her out.
Ohmygoshright!? I‚Äôve gained a bunch of weight over the course of the pandemic, but every time I look in the mirror I think, ‚Äúboobies have grown too though *finger guns*‚Äù

I see this as an absolute win (MtF)		"Press it 100 times
Outcome would be the same either way. Either I‚Äôll get lucky and become a woman physically, or spend that money to fully transition
I hope I‚Äôm the one percent!
I‚Äôd like the % odds reversed, please.
Im going to collapse the u.s. economy to become a cis girl
So many eggs in those comments. So many.
I'll take the million because I am already a girl. :)
I mean, press it. You either have a 1% chance of instantly becoming a woman, or have a 99% chance of having the money to go through with transition without much concern about expenses.
Can't lose, can I press it more than once?
Auto clicker time
1 million dollars can buy a lot of estrogen...
I got out of being (percieved as) a girl once, i'll risk to have to do it again for this money
Just one question, as a pre-everything FTM, would that make me a cis girl, or do absolutely nothing? But either way, I'd push the button. A million dollars would go a long way towards transitioning and building a life of my own.
I'd pay a million dollars just for the one percent chance.
Jokes on them, I‚Äôm a trans guy. Money all the way lmaoooo
I would hit that button so fast lol.
Idk, those are pretty slim chances of getting what I want
Can I press it more than once
I‚Äôd press the button and if I lose I‚Äôll spend the million and be the girl I‚Äôm meant to be!!  Either way I win. üòÇ
I thought I was a dude and was like HELL YEAH!
PUSH PUSH PUSH PUSH

Now I either have all the money to transition or I'm a cis girl lol.
I don't understand the people who wouldn't press it, like.. I don't give a shit what gender I am, just give me free money.

heck, I'll press it 1000 times just to be able to be incredibly rich, and if I want to be a man again at some point, well.. I'll have the money to do it.
Fuck yeah I would
Yes
Either press it once and have enough money to transition or press it once and get it for free, WIN WIN
I've never wanted to roll double zeroes so bad before.
I'm already a bio girl, maybe then I'd feel comfortable in my own body PUSH
That million funds my transition and my escape plan hundreds of times over
Sooo what you‚Äôre telling me is that if I press this button there‚Äôs a 100% chance I‚Äôll become a girl, but a 1% chance it‚Äôll happen a whole lot faster?
Laughs in trans
I see this as an absolute win (FTM and pre-transition)
Only a 1% chance?? 

Fuck those odds.

Still pressing it tho
Heck I'm trans masc and I'd press it. If it means I can be a woman without struggling with dysphoria and other problems I don't mind
I want to be in the one percent
Press it a hundred times.
A win for me either wayüòÉ
I'm pressing that button untill I get the one percent.
I‚Äôd push it so many times
It's no surgery or money for the surgerys win/win
Am I allowed to press it more than once?
Literally no downside at all! As others have said, live your dream, or have enough to fund it!
Well, can I press it until I get the 1%?
Somedays... yeah.  I'd rather go back to being cis sometimes when it gets too tough
Yeah
Hits button until I get that 1%
I would press it, hoping for the 1%, fuck the money
""I'll take 100 buttons!""
My luck, I‚Äôd hit the button so hard it breaks and get an, ‚ÄúOhhh wow I‚Äôm sorry. This has never happened before. We‚Äôre going to have to disqualify you.‚Äù
*spams it 100 times* mwuhahahahahahah
...My brain is too used to RPGs cus I was calculating it like there's a chance for both.  
""Ah so 99% chance of this BUT ALSO that happens 1% of the time"" when clearly the odds are stacked like that cus it's an if else scenario.
Either a free transition or a free transition with extra cash!
It's time to use my Minecraft player powers to jitterclick the button.
100 trans girls push the button: 99 become millionaires and last one presses it and nothing happens because they were all already girls.
Keeps pressing the button till it breaks
Literally the best thing ever
PRESS IT 100 TIMES
*runs away in a panic*
""oh no ! I get 1 million dollars...""
I‚Äôd slam it hard!
So 1% chance of no effect
Its a win win
How many times can you press it ü§î
time to get an autoclicker
ONLY a 1%?
Both
Being rich to become hot lol
The odds with HRT alone are significantly higher. Besides the fact we are girls already. Take the money and get surgery.
I‚Äôd be annoyed because that 99% of the time I‚Äôd be disappointed. At least the million can help me transition.
Where‚Äôs the downside? ü§£
My husband: wait, will I look like that?
Me: yeah
Him: yes
Idk, 1% chance seems a little too low
Body slam the button.
So it's either a low chance of the easy way, or being rich enough to do it the hard way. Don't mind if I do.
Already one, but the chance of being young, shapely, and cis girl OR get a ton of cash?

I‚Äôm not seeing the downside.  (<== As I reread that, it occurs to me that that really isn‚Äôt a male thought.)
Statistically speaking, if I press it 100 times I will get 99 million dollars and become a cis girl!
I‚Äôd be disappointed if I got the money tbh.
Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
Ah, the glory of having a chance to either get a lot of money or satisfy one of the many things that I am mildly curious about.
Without a doubt,.. no way I can lose!!!
Become rich and a girl? Big yes
Press the million and use half the money to become a girlüòÖ
Can I spam until it happens?
With where I'm at in life and being comfortable with myself, I think I'd take the million honestly. Becoming a girl is something I'd love but 1% chance isn't worth it compared to almost 99% million
Funny enough I was actually thinking, jees my chances are slim but maybe I might get lucky.
How many times are we allowed to press the button?
eh, could be better: 1% million dollars, 99% become a girl
Yeah i would. Id rather have the money. Meaning no matter what happens i can provide for my kids and wife. I could just be what i want to be and never have to worrie.
What I see is become a girl or become a girl with extra steps but get some noney for my troubles
either way the money wld go to hrt, top, bottom and all the other surgeries i want so it‚Äôs rlly a win win
I would spam press it until I got that 1%
I would press it forever, free money and saves me a surgery/estrogen pills
I use the million to become girl, now i have 100% chance to become girl
Man if only that button was real, it would make coming to terms with myself so much easier
Either way your gonna be a girl üòÑ
hell yeah i‚Äôll press that
I either have enough money to transition or just become a woman I would press this button instantly.
Either way I see a win
Pushed !
Ill smash it cause either I will become a millionaire or become Girlx2
Either way I win
Who said I couldn't push the button more than once?
I would
hitting it over and over
Spam that button
Press it as much as possible.
Can we reverse those odds??
Both good (for a trans girl at least)
Push the button 100 times
Is it weird that these make me sad? I‚Äôll never have either one of those‚Ä¶
It doesn't say you physically become a girl, so I wonder about that... is it girl as in identifying as female or girl as in feminine physical features?  
Either way, I'm the wrong kind of trans for this but I'd *still* press the button. That much money with 99% odds is worth the risk of having to redo my top surgery, assuming it's physical girl-ness at stake.
i wouldn't even think twice.... and push it like 1000 times till im a cis female
I...am a girl...\*presses it 200 times so i get to keep half\*
I'm pre op ftm so literally no biggie. I'll probably end up winning the money and using it for my transition anyway.
Fuck it! YOLO!!
I don't get it. There's no bad outcome.
If only the odds were reversed üôÑ
Either way is great
Trick question. 1% chance I would have a easier time becoming the women I am vs. 99% chance I would use money to still become the women I am. Either way it's a win!
Can I press it 99 times
I could use that million to get the surgery
Either I get money to pay for a transition, or I get it automatically and will just have to get top surgery since I don‚Äôt want a chest. So I guess it‚Äôs good either way
Autoclicker
I mean both options are hella good wait do I turn into a cis woman because if so fuck yes I'm going for that %1
* jitter clicks the button*
I'm already biologically one at least this way I'd be able to afford surgies :///
I‚Äôm honestly perfectly fine with either
I'd hit the button. If I lose I'm now cis, if I win, woo! Money for transition!
Just keep pressing it until you win the prize.

Then spend the millions you collect on the way funding research to improve transition treatments, clinics to improve access to trans healthcare, and/or politicians to improve legislative support and protection for trans people.
Can I press it until girl?
Win win
id press it 100 times to ensure it happens
I'd press it. If I get 1mil I'll just use it on surgery and estrogen. If I become a girl then I'm a girl
Sounds like a win-win to me!
As a trans man pre T this is a win for me too because if I get the money I can transition faster and if I get the girl one nothing much happens and I can still transition :D
Wait. How many times can I press it?
So become a girl or get enough money to become a girl?
I see it as a 1% Chance of a good outcome, and a 99% Chance of an outcome that I could live with. XD
I'd fucken press it if it were the other way around
Eh either become a girl and have a nice Chuck of change or use the money to transition and still have a fair chunk of change ""Professor hulk I see this as an absolute win meme here""
100%
I like how the OP says they wouldn't. I would smash that like button faster then a YouTuber could ask for it.
Either makes you a girl or gives you enough money for you to do it on youre own lol
welp... time for brain damage *\*slams head on button 100 times\**
So, let me get this straight‚Ä¶ I have a 99% chance of a million dollars AND I become a girl? Yes please üéÅ
‚ÄúOne female body, please!‚Äù Win/Win
Id just keep pressing it to have both.
Abso - fuckin - lutely
I‚Äôll just take the money tbh
As a gatcha gamergirl I still have better odds here then getting my waifu. Starts spamming the button.
Can I just press it until I'm bored?
As a totally not an egg: I‚Äôd push it and pray to RNGsus
If I got the 1million, I would spend it on becoming a girl, so the end result would be the same. That 1% would just make the whole thing faster and easier.
Click macro that button rn‚Ä¶ one click per milliseconds
Dam my Reddit username is not updated and is calling me mr feels bad
I'd press it and be pissed to be a millionaire
I see this as an absolute win
Where can i find it!!!?!??
What's the limit
That's what I call a win-win
I‚Äôd press that button til I became a girl. The money though maybe keep some the rest goes to homeless people
I‚Äôd do it. I‚Äôm NB and like my AMAB body but wouldn‚Äôt be too upset to be a girl
Can we swap those percentages thou?
Yes until I get 1%
Button button button!
Either become a girl or use the million dollars to pay for transition.
Win, win.
I'd rather the million because after transitioning, I'd still have enough money to not worry about college debt or buying a house/apartment afterwards.
You know, money can't buy happiness, but a million dollars would pay for one hell of a medical transition with money left over. At the least I could do a whole lot of good with it.
Well I'm an ftm pre-t so if it's physically become female, I'm already there, if its mentally become a girl well that'll make my life a whole lot easier!
and what would i do with 1 million dollars? get some impossible whoppers?
I would be fucking horrified if I got that money
Please dont be money, please dont be money
The question is, will I be a complete biological woman? Then I'd push him harder than Tyson Fury!! üòÖ
She‚Äôs too smart to be kept alive
So what are you doing with 100 million dollars?
Why not more?
Dear god the inflation
Why only 100 times? Keep it and go infinite.
Same
Why stop at 100?
My thoughts exactly
Ditto!
This
I feel ya, I truly do
Well either way you can become a woman so I‚Äôd like the 1mil personally
if the 1% does come true, you‚Äôll become double the girl
Yeah thats how buttons work
underrated comment
Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll rig it for ya ;)
Coming right up!
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs up to you to decide
HRT and FFS
I got 99 million problems but being my agab ain't one of them...?

SHES TOO POWERFUL
Just keep pressing till it happens
And lots of clothes!!
Right? Wish I could afford ""for fucks sake"" too. *Tear*
.99^100 if the button exist and you only press it 100 times then there's still a 36.6% chance that all you got was money. Statistics was the only math I was ever good at lol
It heckin better
Great Idea. Become the the girl and have the money.
I know it's a simple problem but I'm still in awe of your skills.
all I'm hearing is keep pressing the button.
So keep pressing til u Get it

"the wave of ""I'm trans but I don't think trans people should be in sports"" posts in trans subs sure is exhausting"	"At this point I have a hard time believing any of those posts were made by actual members of the community, with the amount of far right and transphobic and just plainly ignorant rethoric they seem to be based on, I'm inclined to say they are majority trolls posing to cause a scene

In my views the matter of fact is Lia Thomas is the first trans woman to win at a high level sports event, her times and history seem to indicate she is a competent athlete but is not dominating anything, as far as I know not even her competition seem to think that's the case, so it is yet to appear a sports-dominating trans woman and it is yet to be determined if there is a problem (unfairness has never been a problem unless it's minorities winning).

Can we move on please? Leave her alone, we shall see her future results. Leave us alone, the day to day trans people have nothing to do with high level sports. And leave kids out of it for fucking sake, let kids be kids"	"We've locked this post. After 440  comments, most possible sides of this issue have been presented and represented.
they only talk ab women‚Äôs sports when they want to prevent women from doing things. they don‚Äôt even MENTION trans men on T having to compete against cis women or in men‚Äôs sports
‚Äúas a black man‚Äù -White politician who forgot to switch accounts
Lia Thomas is most certainly not the first trans female athlete to compete in NCAA Swimming but they made a big issue because of her skills
no one cares about how often trans people lose in sports, but as soon as one wins, they lose their shit, just let people be people for fucks sake
I understand the concern to a certain degree, but also scientists have already proven that after so long in HRT, trans women do not have a physiological advantage to cis women. I used to be an athlete before I started transitioning, but I gave up because being trans in sports just seems TERRIBLE rn
Sports itself is about the person who has more skill, trans people are adhering to the rules they have to which are far more strict than their cis counterparts. If we are going to disqualify trans people then we need to disqualify any person who has an advantage.  No more Micheal Phelps, no more Simone Biles, no more Usain Bolt.

It's just another distraction from  bigger issues and it is totally soul sucking sux
I honestly just don‚Äôt care, I think it‚Äôs a stupid argument and that it‚Äôs just fucking sports and not a reason to hate a whole group of people, also, since when did conservatives care about women‚Äôs sports.

Edit : have I not made it clear that I litterally don‚Äôt fucking give a shit, what else do you want me to say? I‚Äôm sorry but none of y‚Äôall cared about womens swimming at a collegiate level until you had a group of people you could hate because of it, if you aren‚Äôt someone with a good understanding of endrocrenology, human anatomy, sports and gender dysphoria then shut the fuck up, and I‚Äôm one of those people so fuck all of you I‚Äôm out of here.
The trans people shouldnt compete bc we have an advantage argument is dumb, every body is different.
But‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ trans or not‚Ä¶ you compete in your respective genders division, no? I mean, unless they are advocating for a ‚Äòtrans olympics‚Äô but that seems kind of bleh. 

So what if ur a trans woman you shouldn‚Äôt have to compete against Michael Philips just because some boomers got their feelings hurt lol
I think it's probably mostly trolls, to be completely honest. My girlfriend's cis mom is openly in favor of trans women competing in sports (after an appropriate amount of time on HRT).

Also, Lia Thomas won one race and got 5th in another, broke no national records, and only broke a local record in a small race. Did she beat some silver medal Olympic athletes? yes, but they've done better elsewhere before than they did this time.

The whole thing is a sensationalized non-issue and most of the people complaining are cis men who have never watched women's sports at all.
I dunno, apparently they get mad and call it unfair when we play jeopardy now so I fucking give up.
They're ignorant as to how hormones work.
The entire argument of trans ppl shouldn‚Äôt be playing sports is low key dumb like by that logic then we should be doing sports off of physical capability (weight,height,etc) and not gender. Plus scientists have said that if a trans woman has been  on HRT for long enough, then their physical capability is the same as cis women. And from what I‚Äôve heard, it‚Äôs required to be on HRT for a certain amount of time in order to play
There needs to be a couple more studies to verify it but I remember reading something about hemoglobin efficiency and RBC dropping in trans women to a degree that would probably affect performance.

Not that determined transphobic people will read it‚Ä¶
I love how at no point has it crossed anyone‚Äôs minds in TERFland that maybe, just maybe, the kid who‚Äôs been swimming since she was a kid can possibly just be a good swimmer.

We can‚Äôt have a trans person who‚Äôs world-class at anything! That‚Äôs unfair! /s

Whiny transphobes wanna talk unfair? Ban Michael Phelps and we‚Äôll talk.
Yeah, most of her critics ignore how well she did pre-transition, or just flat-out make up bad stats for her that never existed.

Not to mention college sports is quite casual compared to, say, the Olympics or World Championships. It's a freaking hobby, yet transphobes somehow make more of an outrage out of Lia's single gold medal than, say, any doping case in the Olympics. The latter being the only cheaters in this equation.

Weird how it's always the cis people cheating, and giving eachother a free pass when cheating...all these recent accusations are a helluva lot of projection, if you ask me...
the fact of the matter is that those who want to keep us out of women's sports are not doing so to protect women, our out of a sense of fairness, despite what they may say. Right-wingers have found this as a potential wedge issue they can use to *restrict trans people's ability to participate in society*, even in a small way, such as barring trans people (particularly trans children) from sports. They are HOPING that this will allow them to further restrict our access to public services, and public life.

If you think that it will stop here, because this is a ""*reasonable""* limitation, you are falling for a transmisogynistic trap.
Cis people signal boost fake trans opinions that agree with their pre-conceived transphobic notions. Sadly you'll see this all over reddit in places that arent exclusively made for trans people
i had to leave several groups bc of it. i‚Äôm ftm, not an athlete by any means. but seeing that shit made me feel so awful
As a trans person, I definitely think cisgender people should not be in sports
All the evidence I've seen so far says that if you've been on HRT for long enough and your hormones are continually managed there's no significant advantage in trans women over cis women.

Until I see compelling evidence to the contrary, I don't intend to change my mind on the subject.
""but biology""

great argument there! glad to see transitioning has not broadened your understanding of gendered experience and that you have drank the misogynistic koolaid society has spent millenia instituting. glad to see that even after transitioning, you continue to see women as inherently inferior to men and that trans women are only a spectre of true womanhood. glad transitioning has expanded your mind to such great lengths.

disgusting takes from people who should know better.
I just saw one of these types of posts today
Yeaah it's getting three days past silly sunday at this point, it just shows ignorance not just to *how trans people work* but *how hormones work in general.* For *a lot* of transfem the point is kinda *to switch out/reduce/remove the very hormone that is supposed to give an advantage?!?!?*
The way I see it, they couldn't ban Michael Phelps from swimming even though the man is a genetic freak of nature and had a very literal biological advantage, so why is the ghost of testosterone past something that means you're required to lose every time but we let dolphin boy wear 30 lbs of gold on his neck for photo ops?
Why are there trans people that enjoy being marginalized?

Why do they enjoy kissing Gender Critical Ass?
My god. You just said everything I have been thinking but couldn‚Äôt put into such succinct and perfectly stated words.
I'm part way in the don't compete camp but specifically just don't compete in competition YET, I don't think we understand everything enough yet so some more research into performance to see if we perform better or worse on average than our counterparts and then set where we would compete... I want to do martial arts competitions myself but that's years off for me, so much practice before I'm where I want to be
This sub and many other trans related subs are rife with cis-pleasing trans people, whether they realize it or not.
It‚Äôs just so laughable that people don‚Äôt even think twice about things that are complete hearsay.  I‚Äôm no athlete but firsthand I know that when my blockers and estrogen started to kick in my muscles shrank and bike rides that were easy before HRT suddenly became challenging.
They talk a lot about that trans woman Fallon Fox who injured another woman during boxing - and acted as if injuries never happen between two cis people boxing ~ as if that's not what the whole sport is known for.
I saw a post underneath this supporting trans people in sports, huh. neat
sadly there are a lot of trans people saying this garbage view, ive had to remove myself from quite a few
As long as whoever is playing doesn‚Äôt have an actual advantage such as way higher testosterone/estrogen lvls then normal, which is already regulated for both cis and trans people in order to prevent cheating from happening, then it doesn‚Äôt really matter to me, I already think we should separate by skill lvl instead of gender anyway lol
I keep seeing on YouTube Brandon Tatum, Etc making disgusting transphobic videos regarding these types of things. I'm non binary. People who are conservative especially need to stfu and mind their own....
Also it‚Äôs incredibly exhausting to have to argue with people abt something as fucking unimportant as sports (LITERALLY THEYRE FUCKING GAMES) while trans people across the United States are having rights stripped away repeatedly. But yeah, a fucking soccer game is more important than trans kids being taken away from their parents FOR BEING TRANS‚Ä¶.
Just do it by power level instead of gender. Sports already separate by weight they can do power too.
how do people get to the level of being transphobic in a trans subreddit
Let‚Äôs not forget that anybody being against trans women in sports doesn‚Äôt see them as real women, and it‚Äôs bullshit.
I don't think there should be sports ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
They can theyre just needs to be rules in place before they can compete
I said on another post about this topic that part of me wishes there could be a trans women‚Äôs league so that our athletes wouldn‚Äôt get backlash for competing with cis women and the terfs can shut up about the fairness of it. But looking back I was wrong, trans athletes should compete in the league they feel comfortable in, and it‚Äôs only the bigots that need to change, not the athletes that are playing by the rules. Additionally, I‚Äôve learned just how transphobic Reddit can be, several thousands of upvotes and horrible comments towards our community on anti-trans posts, mods having to lock these comment sections and yet the post isn‚Äôt taken down and the comments aren‚Äôt deleted. The comments supportive towards Lia Thomas and the community as a whole are downvoted into the ground. Why do bigots still feel the need to debate our existences?
Yeah to those trans transphobes...

Stop it. A house divided cannot stand. We must be united in our fight.
The reason I think this is really stupid is that \*everyone has advantages in sports that are biologically inherent\*. You fuckers are the ones who decided to separate this by gender without a complete understand of what it is.  


One need look no further than Michael Phelps, who's body is built for swimming with his double-jointed angles with ridiculous flexibility and size 14 feet, not everyone has their bodies built like that. Should he be allowed to compete with people who aren't double jointed, who don't have the joint flexibility he does, who don't have size 14 feet that basically turn his feet into flippers? Maybe we should force him to have his feet surgically reduced in size to compete, huh?

But I will say this argument isn't even worth our time to engage in. It's a trap of an argument because it's not one that's an easy one to win in the first place, and it's not one that's really important to the lives of trans people. It's a small, niche subject that's used to attack trans people where conservatives actually have some... decent arguments against it. Don't fall for this trap, just say ""Yeah, that is a tough one. What about puberty blockers for kids, though? Surely you have to support that."" Push them into the conversations you can trounce them in.
I remember once reading something about how they made a trans man in boxing box a woman and then got mad that he won lmao.
Fun fact, 1/3 of trans women voted for Trump in 2016.
[deleted]
tbh maybe a hot take; i‚Äôm trans and i just don‚Äôt give a fuck. like i couldn‚Äôt care less about sports, play in whatever division you feel most comfortable in. do what you like, if you‚Äôre good, cool; if you‚Äôre not, me neither. everyone surely has a bigger problem on their plate than someone regardless of gender identity who‚Äôs swimming or running with people who they‚Äôre different from.
If you find a transphobe doing shit like this, ask them why they think trans women shouldn't participate in women's sports. If they say some physical attribute like weight or height, ask them why we can't divide the sports based on that then. Let them make an idiot out of themselves. If they say something else its probably just misogynistic bullshit, call them out and leave them at that. Don't waste your time trying to convince them, they are either too fucking stupid or care more about their feelings than facts.
hi yes i‚Äôm a closeted trans-masc/genderqueer/genderfluid/whatever tf i am playing softball and golf. played golf on the boys team as a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù bc our school didn‚Äôt care enough to make a girls team. got *heavily* discriminated against for it. does anyone care that i‚Äôm dying in my sports rn? no. but i‚Äôll bet if i came out i‚Äôd be kicked off both teams and told that i was making the sports unfair. let the kiddos be. 

this rant makes no sense rereading it but yeah. there you have it
Just cause its gendered doesn't mean its an advantage yeah, it just feels so racist and sexist when cis women ""pass"" the ""allowable"" testosterone levels but people with flipper like ankles get a pass.
Tbh I thought so too, but never cared much about looking at the evidence because I'm a lazy pos. But not even the media seems to make a huge issue out of it atm, so Idek where this wave is coming from
Yes, often alt righters will ""pose"" as trans to sow discord.
It‚Äôs bs trans women are women and vice versa therefore should be allowed in women‚Äôs category of sports especially since they let biological girls with naturally higher testosterone or other advantages compete
I think all women should be able to be in sports weather you are trans woman or Cis Woman. Give them a chance and in school too. One school in Cedar Rapids a few weeks ago tha local news station was live on Facebook and they was covering it. There was a school walk out for sports for transgenders and it was a huge success
Yes I think a lot of them are just fake burner accounts to muddy the water.
It's okay for there to be various opinions about what fair means,  what gender means,  etc.  It's okay for the rules to be different in different contexts and in various sports.   It's okay for the rules to be different for young people and elite athletes.  It's okay for there to be distinctions between folks who transition before puberty and after.  This one size fits all thinking is not a good match for the real world, not even in the tiny world of trans themed subreddits.
I hazard a guess that trans sports brings so much negative attention that other trans people hope throwing in the towel on this battle will give us some respite. The problem is it's not about sports. The right wing dickholes who hate us just think this is good angle to erase us. No trans sports = something else they will try. For me personally I will go with whatever science based policy the sporting people decide. I don't care about sports, but removing us from public life, fuck no!
Yeah it's bleak as hell. Cis people come in all different shapes and sizes too and only very few of them ever make it to the Olympics, so logically even fewer of us would make it, just going by the odds. And also I'm disturbed by how transphobia is rising again in general and nobody is talking about it.
whats the point in caring about sports if you're not competing?

this is an overblown issue that should really be about as big as a conversation in a locker room.
I dont think sports should be this glorified period. No matter who takes part in it. I hate all sports communitys/fandoms, they have some of the most toxic ppl I ever met. And dont even get me started on working out that shit is even worse‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
No. They arent trolls. Look at my post history. I told my friend yesterday that I didnt think Lia Thomas should compete because seeing all of the backlash messed with me on a deep level. Not the greatest impulse and I kind of calmed down once I was out of the heat of the moment.

Not everyone with an opinion contrary to yours is a troll. Just sayin'
 At the scholastic level, it's a no-brainer. School sports are about inclusion and youth enrichment so there's no good or even acceptable reason to exclude transgender athletes.

At the professional and Olympic levels, I think it's a far more difficult subject and I'd not want to be part of the group that has to figure it out.
Yes, you are completely right.

It is again bigots that try to exclude a minority like the Black community in the early 2000's. People like Hitler wanted to ban them due to having better results than his perfect humanoids.

They just seek for an opportunity which seems easy like sports to then be even more bigoted etc.

Also sry that I say that, but that is typical American again.
All I have to say to those people is haters gonna hate.
She has directly caused trans issues to come back up at a time when I'm finally making progress with a very conservative family. Terrible optics and we gain nothing, it's just another reason for conservatives to hate trans people and gain popularity for their all out bans.
This is literally the only reason I‚Äôm not out to my family and most people
I just don't think trans people gain anything from all this drama, advocating for trans athletes in sports isn't worth it, it's never gonna look good. Much more important shit going on that actually affects trans people's lives.
I made a video how more science and handicaps would be the best solution, we need to show how unscientific the trans ban in sports is and base it in science for each sport since Most sports trans women don't have an advantage https://youtu.be/fRQoAB92GjU
When a trans woman wins 3rd or 5th at a women's sports event, no one bats an eye.

When she wins 1st place, everyone loses their fucking minds!
[removed]
Im still forming an opinion on the situation. 

Do people in this subreddit advocate for a trans man to continue to play in women's sport and a trans girl to continue to play in a man's sport?
I think we should just get rid of all sports. I mean, people can exercise and stuff, but the competition aspect just makes people nasty to one another.
[deleted]
It's exhausting seeing these posts as well
A trans woman competing in cis womens sport invariably creates issues regarding competitive integrity, which is the fundamental issue. All the bluster surrounding social justice and virtue signalling as well as discrimination and slander is just that, unproductive and distasteful noise. The issue is sporting integrity and there is little doubt it‚Äôs an issue here.
There are actual trans people with those views, and it seems like your invalidating there transness when you say ""I'm inclined to say they are majority trolls posing to cause a scene"" . Not thinking trans girls should be in women's sports isn't a far right postion so pretending that it is is dishonest.
Trans here, support trans athletes, but can admit that AMAB musculoskeletal systems give an advantage of strength over AFAB persons. So there is a lot to figure out and doesn't have to be an all or none. I wish it had a simple solution, but realistically it doesn't (other than a ban, which is bad). Length of transition or testosterone levels or the like, idk as I'm not an expert in the field. 

Also I don't get the ""just divide by weight class"" argument. 160lb cis female would have disadvantage to a 160lb cis male boxer. And you wouldn't want 6 different volleyball league divisions, where you usually have a mix anyway (like any team sport).

Whether she should or should not compete, I neither know, nor care. However, my personal opinion is that I feel that she is drawing negative attention to the trans community. Not all of us are revolutionaries. Some of us are just lumbering from one day to the next, just trying to make it through. And that additional spotlight makes it harder for many of us who are just trying to get through life in one piece.

As much as I know some Cis girls have more T than transwomen‚Ä¶

She‚Äôs been competing for a long time, do we know when she started to transition? 

T levels? 

Do we know anything about their life? 

I‚Äôd argue how close the race was? Was it by several seconds? Was it close? Was it a reasonable victory? No one three to make her look bad?

What do we know specifically

I‚Äôm sorry but there are like a dozen examples of trans women doing super well in sports but none of trans men doing well. That clearly shows an advantage
There is a post in r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns that perfectly explains it
It's because in general they don't care about women's sports unless there's an opportunity to discriminate.  Men have banned ciswomen from competing with men when women started winning medals over the men.
  
Madge Syers wins 2nd in the World Figure Skating Championships in 1902 and women were banned in 1903 until a segregated event was created for 1905.

Margaret Murdock won silver at Olympic free shooting in 1976 and that spurred the creation of a segregated women's shooting category. 
  
Zhang Shan wins gold in Barcelona 1992 for another shooting event, women banned from the 1996 Atlanta Olympics until they got a segregated category in the 2000 Sydney games.
there was a trans man (pre T) in the same competition who wasnt allowed wear male swim gear even tho hed had top surgery, I'd rather talk about that ngl.
Right, we‚Äôll they don‚Äôt phrase it as a trans issue, but in most sports, T is considered a performance enhancing drug, and having higher than norma T is an indicator of PED use. Having too high of T is an already agreed upon unfair advantage. 
I think the conversation or trans folks in sports will probably always be about trans women competing against CIS women because while trans women can lower their T, most cases of trans women in sports were athletes who experience puberty with high T.
That‚Äôs because us trans men wouldn‚Äôt have that advantage over cis men ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I can't speak for all obviously but...is it that hard to believe that at least some people are going to disagree with you?  At least on a case-by-case basis.  If OP finds it exhausting how many people have different views, I find the same from the amount of people who will accept no alternate view except the one that agrees with them.  Not just as a question of compromise - I get that there can be no compromise in equality, but as a question of _framing_.  People see equality in different ways, meaning different things.

Disagreement is not transphobia.  It _can_ be, but is not by necessity.
Which aren't even overwhelming.
Went from 462nd in male to 1st in female - she still has advantage from years of male puberty and more hydrodynamic bone structure (wider shoulders, hips, more height). I hope there is a separate category for transgender athletes, though!!
But I still think it is unfair, there is a difference between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs sort that can‚Äôt be denied. But in the end, I‚Äôm not knowledgable enough to argue so‚Ä¶
This happened with me actually. I'm a competitive climber and it wasn't until I made Divisionals, which is what literally every other sport calls regionals, that anyone gave a fuck
But that would mean one less easily exploited minority to pick on and they *really* don't like that, so time for them to start yelling about things they know nothing about and shouting bad-faith arguments aimed at baselessly vilifying trans people.
Case in point, Lia Thomas had another race besides the one she won, where she finished fifth. I saw zero posts about it, and people will still be yelling about how nobody can compete with her.
Yeah, I saw an article about the trans cyclist that won a competition who everyone was trying to make a stink over a few years ago. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt remember her name. But everyone was saying ‚Äúoh the poor woman in second place!‚Äù. But there was a quote from the trans woman saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs interesting that nobody ever talks about all the times she beat me before and then subsequently after the time I beat her‚Äù.
No one cares about anyone who loses in any sport, is this really a point? When do we ever talk about last place folks?
The hrt thing is exactly where my opinion comes from. Sure, it's reasonable to not allow trans women who aren't on hrt to compete because that's essentially the same advantage they'd have if they took some hormone based drug to do the opposite. But after a certain amount of time that benefit is gone. I don't know exactly the statistics but that seems like an easy and scientifically provably fair way to at least stop anyone with genuine concerns from complaining.
Trans women and cis women, careful with language.

Bit i agree it must the bad all the time but specially now. Some transphobe troll asked me why haven't trans women appear often in high level sports and that's the reason, at least a good part of it
There was one fairly recent study that said that HRT levels the playing field in like all categories, except for like long distance running where trans women had like a 10% speed advantage. 

But the study didn't compensate for height differences or something like that iirc
So, I want to say that science has actually not proved that point yet.  Some studies have shown that actual performance drops into the cis female range, but the average trans fem performance is above the average cis female performance significantly in certain things.

The rest of the science has been focused on lean muscle mass, grip strength, etc. As measures of whether trans women are in line with cis women, and those have been argued to show trans women outperform cis women.  Though I would argue they are based on weak data and false premises.

It sucks the position we're in right now, because so little research has been done on transgender people, and much of the research that has been done has been done poorly  and with ulterior motives (e.g. the AGP paper).
When are people gonna get that women‚Äôs rights can‚Äôt be complete without trans rights. When you say shit like ‚Äútrans women have big bones, big hands, etc‚Äù SO DO CIS WOMEN. You are entirely erasing and alienating whole groups of cis women. The criteria used to determine whether trans athletes can perform ALSO HURTS CIS WOMEN, SPECIFICALLY BLACK WOMEN. Look up Christine Mboma to see all the answers you need.
Can‚Äôt expect logic from people that feel a need to make their dipshit laws include like 7th grade volleyball. It was never about a real advantage.
Whereas cis women who are high level athletes are just really dedicated to their sport. They never have any natural advantages over their competitors.
I have the same concern. One can find ""science"" that proves each side's hypothesis. I don't think most hate trans women but are concerned that cis girls might be at a disadvantage. Even misguided, it's hard to ignore a parent--especially a mom--fear. The most phobic remarks I heard recently are about how Title IX destroyed many school men's sport programs (really?) so trans women are like a divine revenge. Although somewhat late. And how men--no matter what they say--are now destroying women sports. With shit like that on the radio, I can see why some women get paranoid. I don't understand the science so I feel neutral about it. i am afraid these fights will lead to legislation to punish us.

I wonder if these same people are concerned with trans men in sports. 

Nikki
trans women in sports are only an issue b/c of the discourse surrounding puberty blockers, i think we're in a weird limbo in society -- but i think pragmatically trans women should be included in everything except for combat sports --- that's just the optics are too difficult, in the future when every trans kid has hormone blockers -- easy include, it's just we can't do that one yet.
Source for this scientific consensus?
I understand your viewpoint, however there is no argument that men DO have an advantage over women in SOME sports, so I get why people think that a trans woman do have an advantage over a cis women and I tend to agree that that is correct, as lia went from quite a low ranking in the mens division to no 1 in the womens decision but honestly, I don‚Äôt have concrete evidence to back it up so I may be incorrect.
Unsure about this. There is a reason sports are divided and it‚Äôs essentially to give cis women a chance to compete fairly and safely.

I agree and that's why I say the argument doesn't have anything to do with fairness when unfairness if exalted for some and shat on for others (not even that, in a case like Phelps vs Thomas it's proven advantage vs an unproven one)
That's not true at all. You could be highly skilled but you're not gonna get far in basketball if you're only 5'8"". To discredit how much of most sports is physical is asinine.
Very false equivalency in your argument
They never cared about women‚Äôs sports, they just want another reason to hate us.
Some person on TV was talking about skeletons and blah blah and a friend said something about that being a biological advantage. And I just asked if that meant Phelps should be banned from swimming, because he's got some inbuilt biological advantages over most other pro swimmers (ridiculous wingspan for his build, unusually low lactic acid production, and double jointed ankles for more powerful kicks). His competitors don't have that. 

Like pro athletes are some *average*, everyone starting from the same mold.

If the average trans woman is taller than the average cis woman, that doesn't mean she's towering over professional basketball players the average height of a WNBA player is six foot, with the tallest 6 10.

You want to look for any actual advantage of disadvantage of trans athletes, you shouldn't cherry pick sports. Go look at  militaries that allow transgender service members. I suspect you'll still have some skew (being trans likely means feeling you have something to prove) but you're looking at a wider range of people with a minimum fitness level.

Not the top one percent of the top one percent that can even compete at the college level, or the top one percent of that that can go pro or hit the Olympics.

(that doesn't even get into the fact that, duh, if trans people complete trans people will occasionally win. They will occasionally break a record, outperform their normal range, and do all the stuff cis athletes do)
I hate this argument. We should care about women‚Äôs sports. There are situations where a trans woman would have massive insurmountable advantages like if they were an exceptional male athlete or have recently transitioned. If we just ignore that, and counter criticism with ‚Äúsince when did you care about women‚Äôs sports‚Äù or worse ‚Äúwhy do you even care about women‚Äôs sports‚Äù then we are only hurting our cause. We should be trying to find an equitable path that acknowledges the need for fairness in women‚Äôs sports and the impact on trans people if they are blocked entirely from physical competitions.

Simply ignoring the issues is not an option when the result of unregulated admission without a solution to questions of fairness is that bad faith actors looking to criminalize our existence get ammunition to turn public sentiment against us. Lia‚Äôs participation is not unfair, but it is easy to convince people uneducated on the nuances of HRT and muscle atrophy when there is no process. If we don‚Äôt want to be destroyed, we have to be strategic in the fights we pick. Unrestricted access for anyone at any point in their transition is not equitable, not what we should be fighting for, and not what we can let people spotlight in the fight for trans rights. For republicans, if they can find an example of a trans woman stepping on women‚Äôs rights, that‚Äôs their gateway to banning us from all women‚Äôs spaces. Saying who the fuck cares about women‚Äôs sports while also insisting that any trans woman can immediately play women‚Äôs sports hurts all of us by giving them ammo.
It‚Äôs done off physical capability and not gender. Unfortunately, assigned males from birth are generally stronger+faster than assigned females, so that‚Äôs the starting point. The male league is also an open one, but you don‚Äôt see women competing there because it wouldn‚Äôt make sense based on the biological differences.
I fully see that yes, and I agree there will be more transphobia after sports are out of question. i just don't agree with you last point if you are talking about the rules, I'm not sure the people making the rules the accept trans athletes under certain circumstances are the same people wanting to ban them, because the later would be a lot easier to happen if they were
Ban please
Biology doesn‚Äôt make women inherently inferior. We are physically different.

""Three days past silly Sunday"" I've never seen that before, but damn if I'm not stealing it.
I do agree we don't understand it well enough but I disagree that's reason to not compete, if anything compete will give us more sate and bring us closer to understanding better how big could the disparity be if at all, all we see now is a single trans women competing, she won a singular race and got 5th on another, her times are not unbeatable, they have in fact been beaten since she won, so for what we can see now, there isn't really a problem of trans women dominating anything
Lol yeah, i read that injury was so common in the sport that it basically happened every other fight, sadly Fallon Fox was blown out of proportion until she retired
And they disingenuously say she fractured the other woman‚Äôs skull when all it was was an orbital bone fracture which are stupidly common.
Yeah this ""solution"" is just segregation, it's just conceding to the right that we are indeed lesser citizen and lesser humans, i don't think changing anything in terms of categories is the answer, i actually don't think anything needs to be done right now, trans people are not ruining sports for anyone, if anything I think having more science to come with better rules can be good but until then our current rules seem to be doing a fine job, I'd anything I think there should be more trans people succeeding
[removed]
THIS. I am transmasculine, and before I transitioned, I was short for a *woman* and I had a level of testosterone almost 6 times lower than most *women* my age. This was a large part of why no matter how I tried, I couldn't get to be as fast as a lot of other people. So what's the big deal about these trans women who after years on HRT have about the same hormone levels as cis women but may be a bit taller competing with other women? Some cis women are tall and have high testosterone. It's the same thing...
Since you‚Äôre mentioning outliers (i.e. Michael Phelps), Serena Williams also stated in an interview that she would lose 6-0 6-0 in 10 minutes against Andy Murray because of biological differences. And she‚Äôs exceptionally talented. Can we admit that even the strongest-fastest cis woman in her category would most likely lose against an average cis-man in any given sport? This is why the women‚Äôs category was created and while women can (technically) compete in the men‚Äôs category, men can‚Äôt. To go further‚Ä¶a man fighting any woman would probably be considered assault, wouldn‚Äôt you agree?
Probably mack beggs, he was forced to fight in the wen division on state championships for two years despite being multiple years on T and out as a trans man, he obviously moped the floor with the girls but afaik expressed his actual desire was to fight men because he is a man, of course this happened in Texas
Sad
[removed]
Because even if we day to day trans people not involved in sports have nothing to gain from this, we surely have a lot to lose if the point is conceded to the conservatives, even despite our fight we have anti trans people in sports laws popping up in the us in several states (including insanities like sex tests and genital inspection including minors in the name of ""competitive integrity), so if we just say ""sure trans women don't belong in sports"" they will push harder and take more rights and for humiliation on people like us for discrimination, sexual assault included. This issue is not just about if Lia is unfair or not, it actually have very little to do with that
I think sports and specially high level sports are pretty problematic In socio-economic way, from ableism to classism, it is inherently an unfair landscape a minute portion of the population takes part on. Mia Mulder did a great video about that, suggest anyone watch it for some perspective
I don't think there's any reason to hate all sports communities just because many of them have some extremely toxic people. Hate the toxic people, not the communities. I am a trans athlete (swimmer and climber) and my sports communities are super accepting. I agree that sports are too glorified though, it does get way out of hand with football and basketball superfans who dedicate their lives to sports they don't even play...
That‚Äôs not for you to decide though. Sports are an integral part of many peoples lives and it‚Äôs not right for you to say, ‚Äúwho cares, sports suck anyways‚Äù.. it‚Äôs really dismissive.
There will backlash no matter what. Conceding to fascists does not help us at all.
It can be a difficult subject and can also not be, what we see today is that trans women are NOT dominating anything so I'd dare to say there is no problem, and nothing to figure out. Of course, no one is saying that anyone can just ""claim to be a woman"" on their words and mop the floor with the competition, that's why we need rules to accomodate trans people, not ban them. as of right now i think the rules are doing a good job in the sense that no, trans women are not ruining sports for anyone, but I'm in favor of more and better science on the subject to help us come with better rules in the future, that's why we need to understand how all of it works really well, the rules eight now are kinda just eyeballing the numbers, so who knows, maybe they can be more inclusive with more data, maybe they need to me more strict, hard to know, science we need it.
>School sports are about inclusion and youth enrichment

In most countries, but USA tries to fucking monetise everything they can. Although the swimming isn't as bad as things like handegg
I‚Äôve given up on the topic just because there‚Äôs too many factors and I‚Äôm not trying too get a headache.
Yup basically almost all of our problems have to do with dealing with transphobia.
We might not gain anything but we fucking sure lose a lot of we just concede that point
[removed]
Seriously? ‚ÄúNo one cares.‚Äù Oh people do care when that happens. The thing is it‚Äôs just the people they‚Äôre competing against so it never makes any national headlines. 

It‚Äôs a little different when you have ESPN post 10 times on all their social media platforms and make it their headlines news story on sports center because a trans person won a major event and they celebrate it like it‚Äôs the best thing that‚Äôs happened to sports since they started letting black people compete?

Trust me if they ACTUALLY posted about a trans person winning 3rd place in a national collegiate competition like this people would be just as outraged.
""compete against females"" what are you doing on this sub dude, go back to under your rock. And take time to read on the effects of feminizing hrt before saying shot like that, byebye
People are saying that.
Oh no, people can disagree on some that is up for debate, however our right to exist e do our stuff is not, specially among ourselves. When a trans person says that trans people shouldn't be in sports because it's unfair (sorry but are people saying that indeed) they are just wrong, at the very least you could claim to not know because it's a difficult subject, but the truth is that there isn't enough date to prove any one side, there is no proof it is indeed unfair (however there is a lot of evidence that it is not) so doing so a trans person is falling on a Blair white situation, where she is trans but is a talking head for transphobia. If you want argue that maybe rules should be revised, or that Lia Thomas should go through some sort of performance testing to make sure she is not too far ahead, which is problematic anyways, maybe that's arguable, but that it's unfair and therefore no trans woman should be allowed, no
No. Why is this small, uncommon genetic advantage unfair when every other small, uncommon genetic advantage gets celebrated?

Nothing is less fair than sports. The top level is a showcase of rare and exceptional bodies. Unless that body is trans I guess, then suddenly there's ""issues regarding competitive integrity"".

(And this is where you make your incoherent attempt at explaining why it's different in that case without explicitly saying ""but they're not actually women, we only play pretend until a cis person feels slighted"".)
Thanks for confirming that most of these actual trans people who aren‚Äôt trolls are self-hating truscum trying to curry favour with the cis.
Sure, trans people can have these views, but don't expect me to shut up when they are fighting against the rights of us all, me included. I may have been dishonest with their Identity, however the opinion tht trans women are unfair in sports is based entirely on misinformation, bigotry and fear mongering, as of right now the evidence seems to indicate that no, there isn't a problem with trans athletes, as there aren't any trans athletes dominating any sports anywhere
Ah yes 'open a biology textbook 2.0' not at all transphobic

Edit: I don't educate transphobes that are clearly asking in bad faith based on their comment history ü§°
It does have a simple solution: just let trans women fucking play.

Do trans women have an unfair advantage over cis women in sports? I really don't give a shit, they're still women. I never see any of you people bitching about how tall women are dominating netball because of their unfair physical advantage over women as a general population, and let's be real; the reason for that is because their womanhood isn't seen by our cissexist society questionable. So the fact that you think this behaviour is acceptable when it's transgender women in the spotlight is kinda telling with regard to how you see us and our gender.
Not relevant to the point, doping is not in discussion
Transphobic and misinformed
Thats comparison isn't true at all, it's like isn't really any accident happening or about to happen, trans women are not taking control of sports, there is no evidence, it's more like ""to avoid accidents it will by default just run over pedestrians not to put the driver at risk"".

Also ""unfair advantages"" have always been a thing in sports, just think of Usain bolt and Micheal Phelps, unlike them the possible advantages Lia Thomas may or may not have are still unproven and under studied

70 something? Try 400 something.
Shw started transion in 2019, her t levels are according to the rules imposed by the organization.
The race she won was close, by 2 seconds, on a flowering race she lost to the se competitor that had gotten second place. Her exact T levels are not public i imagine but all the rest are.

Who are the trans women doing well? You only ever just hear about Lia Thomas today, last year was laurel Hubbard and way before that, Fallon Fox. Are any of these women you say ""dominating"" the competition?

There probably are trans men compete somewhere but they are not useful for the far right rethoric so they never come into light, unless they are forced to compete with women because of transphobic rules, like was the case with Mack beggs

Okay, let‚Äôs see your list of twelve darling, and if you ain‚Äôt got twelve how about you stick your crap opinion back where came from and stfu.
Fuck, i did not know this

From wiki
*The International Shooting Union consequently barred women from the 1996 Atlanta games. For the 2000 Sydney games, the International Olympic committee allowed women again, but only in segregated competition.*

I do not understand segregation in these kinds of sports.
I think it's pretty blatant that most of the discussions on reddit about trans athletes have a big subtext about ""cis men will always be bigger and stronger than cis women"", which is incredibly ironic considering how many of them claim they're defending women
it‚Äôs so fucked up
legit
absolutely a lot of people think that, but misinformation campaigns are a common thing on reddit, especially anti lgbt ones
So true seems like the trans community is authoritarian your not allowed your own view even as a transwomen myself if you disagree with the narrative then your a troll or evil it's painfully easy to see that in most competitions we have a advantage I don't agree with terfs and transpobes hijacking the argument but I can totally see why cis women and girls are pissed off after having to fight for sporting rights for so long
[removed]
Lia is not even close to dominating, she didn't even beat the pool record much less any NCAA or world record. This year the other swimmers are just slow and salty about it. https://swimmeetresults.tech/NCAA-Division-I-Women-2022/220316F003.htm

You can point out differences in body shape or bone structure that are supposedly advantages and I can point out differences in bone size and weight that confer disadvantages. Realistically they probably cancel out except for the muscle mass issue which is resolved by hormones in 2 yrs max. If it was really such an obvious issue there would be trans people at the top of every sport at this point and research showing a strong effect. Of which, we have neither.

On top of all this, ledecky showed that there's is not that big a gap anyways by beating Lochte a couple years ago for literally the same event. Almost 10 sec faster than any of the current NCAA competitors, Lia included. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/02/24/katie-ledeckys-500-free-time-is-faster-than-ryan-lochtes-as-a-college-freshman/
she was 462nd when on E for more than half a year.
So how about we ban all women who are over a certain height and shoulder width?

Oh right, because this really isn't about height and shoulders, is it?
You‚Äôre pushing the same goddamn TERF/GC narrative of creating separate spaces for Trans women. Fuck that shit dogma.
Oh I love climbing!  I pretty much just do bouldering, and pretty much just indoors.  Do you boulder, or lead climb too?
Are you surprised? Like seriously are you that surprised that people care about your inherent advantage once you actually start winning? Really, you can‚Äôt comprehend why that happens?
This is exactly the point. They're always looking for loopholes that make other people think there's a legitimate point to be made.
thats not really what I'm trying to say, i had meant that everybody freaks out because a trans person wins, and says that they have an advantage, while ignoring all the time trans people have lost in their respective sports, ignoring the very clear evidence that they ***dont*** have an advantage
Exactly. Not to mention that the whole thing is racist too, and has been used against cisgender black women with naturally high testosterone to ban them from competing in sports. Literally happened this past Olympics.
>after a certain amount of time that benefit is gone. I don't know exactly the statistics but that seems like an easy and scientifically provably fair way to at least stop anyone with genuine concerns from complaining


The rules aren't well calibrated because this is a ‚Äònew‚Äô problem.  Things are going to be readdressed and changed directly as a result of Lia Thomson.  The complaining in the meantime is about the idea the organizers drew their line in the sand way too generously and ergo permitted somebody who still had a lot of advantages from how masculine their body was.  But it seems like only a difference in degree ‚Äî if Lia had been forced to wait another two years and looked more feminine then maybe people wouldn't have cared.
I‚Äôm a trans woman and personally, I think if you went through male puberty then a year on HRT is not long enough. After my first year, I barely lost any muscle mass or strength.

I think changing it to three years is a fair compromise and would give them the time to be comparable with cis women. 

At almost five years, my cis female partner is significantly stronger than me (and she knows it and rubs it is) :-)

For high school athletes on puberty blockers or who have never gone through male puberty, they should be allowed to play with no questions asked.
Ahh you‚Äôre so right that was a typo !!!
I wonder if lower bone density gives cis women an advantage over trans women in open ocean swimming?
Yeah, being 10% taller could explain that.  And we don't ban tall women from basketball.
No I do agree. A lot of the research contradicts each other as well. Prior to the resurgence of this conversation, I saw more data supporting Trans Women in sports (I‚Äôm looking for it now but it was a study done by the Olympics Committee.) 

I also think theirs definitely some bias in terms of the criteria they use to measure it. For example, the conversation surrounding testosterone levels‚Äî where cisgender women are being disqualified from the Olympics for having naturally-high testosterone. At that point, what is it even really about? (Spoiler: the answer was white supremacy, which I believe is intrinsically connected to transphobia)
I think you are one of the few commenters I‚Äôve seen in all these discussions that actually has researched the effect of HRT on sports performance in trans women. For everyone‚Äôs vitriol on the topic, the fact as of now is we still don‚Äôt know.
This is where im at... waiting for more evidence. Though generally i am in favor of trans women competing as any other women.
Yep. We can see biological differences between amabs and afabs in sports such as gymnastics; where females compete in different events than males. Women do not compete in rings ans certain elements that are commonly seen in men's gymnastics would be too difficult due to proportions and muscle mass and men wouldn't be able to compete in beam due to the center of gravity being higher causing the balance to not be as good as the female - along with lower flexibility.

There are things that you may not be able to significantly change e.g. bone structure with HRT and that sucks because I want to be a biological male and not stuck in this female body hell-hole where I will never be the same as a biological male no matter how many surgeries, treatments, etc. I go through.
It's not that I dont believe that there aren't big cis women, there are. But the sexual dimorphism in humans is still there.
Actually üòå you‚Äôre wrong. Everyone is born with different characteristics that may or may not give them a natural advantage. And it‚Äôs incredibly harmful the way that we classify these things because it ultimately just ends up othering all women‚Äî trans or cis. For example, the Olympics banning cisgender women with naturally high testosterone (which by the way were black women‚Ä¶.) The whole conversation surrounding the topic is heavily influenced by blatant transphobia and also racism but all people wanna talk about are ‚Äúbig bones‚Äù or whatever the fuck

*** elaboration on ‚Äònatural advantages‚Äô:

Tall women vs. short women
Scrawnier women vs Bulkier Women
Women with big hands vs small
High vs Low Testosterone (I can go on abt how this measurement is problematic how we use it, but either way we‚Äôre currently using it.)

None of these things are intrinsic to cis or trans women. Any woman could have any combination of these.
17 year old trans male athlete in Texas Mack Beggs was forced to compete against cis women even though he was on HRT and wanted to compete against other men. He ultimately won the tournament. Everyone was upset and boo'd him for winning.

Yes. These same people are concerned with trans men in sports, but not in the same way. 

Because this isn't about sports. This is about alienating and othering transgender people. This is about making us villains for no good god damn reason. 

We fail they don't care. We win and they've gotta dig up reasons to take it from us when literally all we want is idk fuckin equality.
The science on one side is the actual observed fact that trans athletes have been allowed to compete as their real gender for 20 years and have yet to dominate women's sports, so there's no evidence of any kind of advantage in the real world. 

What the other side has is speculation about how the advantages they presume exist might work -- combing through all the on-average differences that exist between cis and trans women and pointing to any that might theoretically provide some kind of advantage as though it were self-evidently reason that trans women would dominate cis women in sports if we allowed them to... do the thing they've been allowed to do for 20 years without coming to dominate sports. 

It's the worst kind of bad science, where you seek out any kind of thing that might theoretically justify the thing you already believe rather than observing and reporting on actual reality. When you do that, no matter what you believe, you can find a justification for it.
We‚Äôre on the same page when it comes to combat sports‚Ä¶but what about swimming and weight lifting where having a biological advantage due to being assigned male at birth would be unfair to you (FTM) or to your opponents? Wouldn‚Äôt it be the same?
[removed]
I‚Äôm not arguing with you, I know how you people are and there‚Äôs literally no point wasting my breath.
Science has not proven that...but keep up with your internalized transphobia. If trans women where better off you would see them dominating in every sport they play, instead you see small isolated incidents of it. Also if you are going to go by this then people like Micheal Phelps and Simone Biles would have to be disqualified from being able to compete in any sports since they have natural genetic benefits that they where born with that put them in much higher standings than their opponents
What the fuck is wrong with you? I thought I was fucked up.
""In the swimming example given the trans athlete still has the benefit of a male body frame  
It is not all hormonal""

Lia is around 23 years old and she started her hormones around three years ago, this would actually indicate she doesn't have a male body frame.
I just saw a video of a 7th tall 12 year old playing basketball that noone was demanding he not be allowed to play
You post in the Joe Rogan sub, opinion discarded
No false equivalency
This.
Depends - in gymnastics people normally prefer viewing women's gymnastics :)
Obviously trans women arn't going out and competing when they've just started transitioning and I don't see why them being exceptionally good is a problem.
>i just don't agree with you last point if you are talking about the rules

Again, I think you're not seeing the forest for the trees. This is *not about fairness* and has never been about fairness for these people. It is about attempting to restrict trans people from being full participants in society.
Yes, I do agree. Women are stronger in aspects (not the literal definition of STRENGTH) but they are stronger in aspects such as immune system, balance (due to the lower center of gravity which is why men DO NOT compete in beam), flexibility, fine motor skills, etc.
Yes. I agree-
Ya I get that, I tend to be lots more cautious, you are right that competing would give a much more accurate and larger sample size, I know lots of it can also be tested in labs so honestly even with my idea it should only be a decade at most to see the results but there's always going to be the group complaining not to mention we need more people on the MRA side of things to help, it's really just bigots and terfs  that want to completely ban trans people form competition and mostly trans women because that's what affects the terfs the most 

I'm not too good at getting ideas across so if I sound like an a$$ it's not cuz I am, I'm just bad at social and can try to explain further anywhere I need to
This itself is pretty disingenuous. It‚Äôs somewhat common in men‚Äôs combat sports. It‚Äôs incredibly rare in womens.
Translate that to English please. My point is the more we divide ourselves then other transphobes need to do even less to defeat us.
Did you really just dig through the comments of a trans sub to attack one of the more neutral stance takes in here, as a cis person?

Also, advantage in sport depends on the sport. Women actually have slight advantages in some sports over men. Stop calling yourself a feminist and degrading women at the same time, it's gross. Maybe Serena is right, but that doesn't necessarily justify a blanket rule for all sports, FOR ONE. For two, she sure is giving up quick.

Also, no one here is talking about men competing in women's sports. That's just you, sweetie.
Fair enough, got some stats wrong, I was going off of old information, I‚Äôll admit that. You should really admit to yourself that your prowling around on Reddit leaving hate comments under just like normal shit and subs for groups you‚Äôre not apart of is a pathetic coping mechanism for your own feelings of inadequacy and littleness, which I can‚Äôt prove, but even if I‚Äôm wrong you‚Äôre sure as hell acting like it, so it‚Äôs a pretty safe bet, you impotent freak. I look forward to blocking you and forgetting you exist :)
Whats not for me to decide ? My own opinion on sports ???? I didnt say everyone on this planet should immediatly stop doing sports, I just said it shouldnt be this glorified.
Not everyone that doesnt agree with trans people being in sports is a fascist. Using the word fascist so loosely minimizes the impact that word is supposed to have and makes people not believe you when you call out actual fascists. Also note how in my comment I mentioned that once I wasnt in the heat of the moment my stance shifted.
But these aren't the concerns I'm talking about. When I say it can be difficult, what I actually mean is more scientific. For example, if a transgender womans body naturally creates an amount of testosterone that would be a violation of PED (performance enhancing drugs) policy if found in a cisgender woman, what do you do? Not allowing the transgender woman to compete seems very harsh, but if you do let her compete, it seems like her cisgender competition has a legitimate complaint. After all, the reason that testosterone level is banned in cisgender women is precisely because of the competitive advantage associated with it. So, viewed from this direction, it seems like there's a double-standard.

I don't claim to have any answers or even a strong stance here. I just don't think it can be denied that it's a difficult situation to hash out and there are legitimate debates to be had. Also, to reiterate, I think this issue only exists at the professional/Olympic level.
I mean, she‚Äôs the fastest collegiate swimmer in the country. If that‚Äôs not dominating than idk what is
You're cherry-picking a couple of examples. The overwhelming majority of school sports don't make a dime. Not to mention this has basically nothing to do with trans inclusion in sports.
Is handegg football? I'm assuming so. I fully agree with your comment
Do we?  A trans athlete winning anything significant would do much more harm than good, so I don't want that happening, sorry.
Yeah, like that ever happened.
Define truscum ?

Please elaborate as to why a biology textbook (or biology website) or biology major / degree would be transphobic.
I'm open to changing my views, I really am. Aggressive responses though help no one change though. I'm open to reading articles and studies about how there isn't really any advantage. Truly am open to changing my views, but I want to be able to have something better than ""just let it happen"" as people that are dug in with truly transphobic views won't be convinced. I def want some fuel to use against those people, but I need help.
Yeah, my comment was mostly meant as a discussion. Not saying anyone is wrong or right. Every community can learn a bit with the ‚Äúattract more bees with honey‚Äù way of thinking. I was hoping for some counter points to what I said as it mainly dealt with the idea of sports being a physical competition and that among top athletes in their sports, biologically men tend to have a physical advantage in a lot of cases. I mean, I‚Äôm not beating the top woman in any sport myself. This kind of makes the idea of trans woman competing against CIS women feel like an inherent advantage. Just wanted to know peoples thoughts.
Checks out to me
Yes but do we know how long she competed in the men‚Äôs category? I think that particular detail singles her out and causes problems / unnecessary bad publicity.

Because women being better at ""a man thing"" is threatening to masculinity. . It's a sport that relies more on mastery of concentration and super fine motor skills than brute muscle strength. I believe they also changed the scoring and tally slightly between the men's and women's competition, so they weren't directly comparable.

I am just sharing my opinion, no need to be so offended lol. I do not support people who become batshit crazy over someone who competes in cis female sports as a trans female though I do not support people identifying as female just so that they can win in sports. How was I being offensive?? 

There are biological differences and it is unfair for cis women...also they tend to have wider hips and get more drag in swimming due to the bone structure which cannot be changed with hrt after puberty. It is also an advantage in running where cis women are more likely to suffer knee injuries due to wider hip bones and a larger q angle causing stress to the knees.
I do a pretty good combination I'm way better at bouldering with my red point being V10 but I've been training lead a lot right now with that being the comp season it is
Like yeah actually it's taken me 5 years of competition to get this far and where I am comp wise is all from my own hard ass work. Also I didn't even win anything I just made top thirteen at a lower level competition I have literally never won a usac comp.
I've not read as much of that as I should have but do intend to. I don't suppose you know any good sources for finding more about that? Sports isn't really my scene so I don't know reliable publications. From my cursory understanding tho it's absolute bollocks and more of ""only us very specific people should ever even be given a fair chance"" discrimination against all but the usual ""norm""
I hadn't taken into account puberty blockers but that's a fair point too. My guess would've been for hrt 2 years ish but I'm not on hrt yet (damn 5 year waiting list means it's faster for me to move out the country than even bother to join it) so I'll rely on your judgement for an estimate of what works
Then it's not equal you can say some trans women can complete and some can't it's all or nothing there would be law suits all the time
Yes. They do not have many of the physiological amab changes to ahve much of an advantage.
Every single person ever who thought bone density was inhibiting their ability to float properly in the pool literally just doesn't know how to breathe properly.

Women don't really have that much lower bone density, and many trans women have low bone density before starting HRT.
Yes, but it is overridden by an advantage which is that amab have a taller bone structure with more hydrodynamic features e.g. longer arms and wider shoulders for a better pull, narrower hips which cause less drag, etc. Also more muscle strength and less body fat which means that less energy is required to pull/kick and you swim more efficiently.
That‚Äôs my problem with the way people react. It‚Äôs gotten so stupid they attack cis women because they have naturally high T levels. I mean come on. I enjoy sports as friendly competition and a way to exercise but let‚Äôs be real. Professional sports is nothing but pageantry to begin with, a way to celebrate certain physiological dispositions that haven‚Äôt served any real purpose since we invented gunpowder and electricity. So just let people play and whoever wins wins.
Still, tall women don‚Äôt complete in the men‚Äôs league, which is essentially open to everybody, because biologically they wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance.
What about combat sports where they very clearly dominate and actually fractured her opponent's skull in one fight?
So, how would people respond to a trans woman who dominated in beam? Or a trans man who dominated on the rings?

I don‚Äôt know much about gymnastics so if this is a dumb question please forgive me.
and hrt makes it even thats the whole point of hrt
yea i think Caro was being sarcastic
In case it wasn't clear, there was a heavy dose of sarcasm in my comment. Apart from a handful of sports that are so expensive that they're dominated by the very rich, the highest levels of sport are not open to anyone without significant physical advantages conferred by genetics and hormones.
Wallflower 
Incredible. I see your point. Nikki
This is a very good take. People that say the ‚Äúscience‚Äù is obvious have no clue how science works and they are taking their biases/prejudices and calling them science. 

What would you say to someone saying there is a‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôll call it a population bias in this instance? Say, the reason why trans women have not dominated cis womens sports is because 1) there are few trans women relative to the population, and 2) there are so few women at the elite level anyway. I guess this falls along the line of probability of trans women being at the elite level. Someone should be able to calculate that, right?
Thanks. I didn‚Äôt realize trans women had been competing this long. I assumed it was recent. Your point should be more prominent. I think it would reassure cis women. N
who's Tia? or why is this in regards to only Tia?  


only Ti i know is my calculator :)

You can develop a male body frame by 20 that would have lasting advantages over people not born as male after hormones
There‚Äôs a kid who was on the middle school basketball team who was 6‚Äô4 at the time, and nobody complained or tried to kick him off of the team. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs so different because that is also a ‚Äúbiological advantage‚Äù like the ones transphobes always whine about.
I raised similar questions to them on this issue when it was the highest profile discussion 

I don't see how that invalidates not an opinion but pointing out a fallacy in a high voted comment on this thread

Hope you find peace xo
Apologies, I don't believe being born with an advantageous body type is equal to competing against a field of people born with a completely different type of body, with less physical advantages, due a different sex at birth to yours

I would be interested if you can further justify your equivalency

Michael Phelps has a small physical natural advantage over most men

He would have an unmatchable physical advantage over anyone not born a male

To disqualify Phelps from a male event would be unfair to him, to have him to compete in an event with anyone not born male would be unfair to them

This is not equal therefor a false equivalency?
They even can't, there are rules in place to assure that... His point is a non factor
Well, the problem is that people can portray that as the situation because we don‚Äôt have a solution to questions of fairness. Them being exceptionally good is a problem because it‚Äôs a remnant of their male puberty, the same argument that TERFs have been using to have us removed from bathrooms, shelters, and other women‚Äôs spaces. TERF ideology is founded on the idea that trans women can never be anything more than men pretending to be women. If trans women win in sports, it lets them make the implicit link for others that are primed to distrust trans women. For them, it is not a big jump to say that their male biology that makes them good at sports is also why you shouldn‚Äôt be comfortable in a bathroom or shelter with a trans woman. The point I‚Äôm making is that bad actors are probing for ways to turn opinion against trans women. Frankly, it would be better for our movement if we denied them this tool and didn‚Äôt participate in women‚Äôs sports. However, that is also an untenable solution because trans athletes deserve to be able to compete. I just don‚Äôt think that we can just be hand wavy about the problems inherent in trans women competing in women‚Äôs sports.
This isn‚Äôt exactly accurate. Women are just as strong as men with a few caveats. Muscle is muscle, whether it is XX muscle or XY muscle doesn‚Äôt make much difference on average. The difference in mens vs womens strength (muscle) comes down to the individual fat free mass. So a 70 kg woman will be likely be weaker than a 70kg man, all other factors being equal, because women will usually have a lower percent of fat free mass than men. This is supported by well known sports scientists like greg nuckoles, mike israetel, etc. 

The caveats to this is men seem to have a testosterone sensitive advantage in upper body strength, and a slightly higher amount of type 2 muscle fibers (over type 1) which makes them better at explosive power sports. Women have a slight advantage in endurance sports. The other caveat is the existence of myonuclei (implicated as responsible for muscle memory). You may be able to make the argument that a testosterone driven puberty aids in the development of these myonuclei, which may never go away. So developing and maintaining strength in a trans woman may come easier than a cis woman. The nearest equivalence to this scenario is a body builder who uses T or any other anabolic steroid. In such cases, I‚Äôve read once the steroids are stopped there is still a roughly 20% advantage the body builder retains. But, no one can say whether this is applicable to trans women.

But all the studies have been done in CIS men and women. Very few studies have been done in trans women (or trans men). Or at the very least, we would need to see exercise performance studies in androgen deprived men.
I can see that but like to remind you that whatever happens, conservatives and terfs will complain, it happened when Laurel Hubbard qualified to the Olympics because ""unfair"" and when she lost they doubled down because ""she threw for optics"" conspiracy, and even if we don't dare to try sports, they will have something to hunt us and our rights over so giving up or or just ""waiting"" is just conceding to them on that front. Not your point but some say that Lia makes us look bad because she is daring to succeed, well I'm sorry all she needs to make us look bad in the eyes of the conservatives is be alive and public, sports or not doesn't matter to them

I didn‚Äôt mean to upset you. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm trying to understand the narrative to be a better ally. It‚Äôs not my intent to degrade women at all. I don‚Äôt agree with you about Serena giving up quick; I think she‚Äôs played her sport well and long enough to understand the differences in stamina she and a man in her league may have inherently due to physical / biological reasons. And yes, I‚Äôm bringing up the issue that men don‚Äôt compete in women sports to point out that biological differences are acknowledged in sports to give women a chance to visibly participate in competitive athletics. I‚Äôm unsure of what the correct answer here is but it doesn‚Äôt help by antagonizing an opinion that differs from yours. I‚Äôm not a troll and I‚Äôm seriously trying to educate myself.
It‚Äôs not for you to decide how much people enjoy it.
No, transphobes are fascist.  I am NOT using the term lightly. That BS sounds just like alt right talking points. The Texas government IS fascist. the Republican Party IS fascist. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt concede one point in the whole battle for our rights. Not that the random people saying we shouldn‚Äôt be in sports are.
It was more a criticism of the hyper-capitalism rampant in the USA. Because I've heard it trotted out as an argument against kids sports being about inclusion, fitness & fun.

School sports raising money through attendance of sports events and pupils getting athletic scholarships for college or university‚Ä¶ it's all a heap of shit

I'm all for trans people playing in sports
Hard disagree, conceding the point means green card for the right wing to push for a blanket ban, that will not affect only potential high level athletes but also regional, college, high school levels, it's green card for them to push discrimination on anything related to sports, ""sex testing"" and ""genital inspections on adults and minors included"", it's all part of the package, as we have seen with many attempts at making some of these laws in the US

You define it honey, you‚Äôre the one who hangs out in that sub.

Well there's your problem. There's no point trying to appease transphobes. It seems like you're arguing a ""respectability politics,"" kinda thing here; it's just that that kind of thing has never really been particularly effective.
Some folks have nothing better to do in their lives but try to tear someone else down. Pretty sad.
Not sure if it's visible (to you), but the OP is responding to a removed comment from a banned user. In this case, it's not about having a dick but about BEING a dick.

Oh wow. You're just... Not it
As far as changing scores it‚Äôs the same in luge and sled events. Women are started lower down on the track so they go slower and so the events aren‚Äôt comparable
It helps hold up the social commentary of men being better than women, an old sexist idea that gets proven wrong over and over
Doesn't make sense - shooting requires a lot of fine motor skills which are developed earlier and more in females than in males where their gross motor skills devslop first and faster.

> I do not support people identifying as female just so that they can win in sports.

Who is doing that?
I‚Äôm so fucking tired of hearing ‚Äúseparate categories for trans people‚Äù all the time from conservatives and gender critical 

Piss off truscum.
Lia Thomas didn‚Äôt transition just to be good female swimmer. I‚Äôm tired of the ‚Äúbiology‚Äù buzzword, also you think cis males don‚Äôt have wide hips? That a stereotypical, not ever cis female has wide hips. And bone structure CAN change HRT during and after puberty I am living proof of that.
That's awesome!  v10?!?!?  Insane!  If anyone else is reading this and doesn't know, that is at the top level of the grades they typically put in gyms.  Amazing job!

&#x200B;

Hope you do well at your future competitions and in training in between.  

&#x200B;

And of course, good luck dealing with transphobes.  I always loved that so much of rock climbing is about ""can't you get your body up to that point"", and it's about problem solving.  People of all backgrounds working the same walls, the same routes, and trying to make it happen for their physique.  Tall or short, old or young, thin or heavy, female or male, flexible or stiff, we've all seen it where people push themselves and often have different ways to top a route.  That's so inspiring to me, to see different people of all walks get the same goal in different ways.  

&#x200B;

Anyways, good luck!  Climbing is a great and amazing sport, both as competition and just for fun.  Total body health for the mind and body.
V10 is pretty good.
Actually, it is EXTREMELY impressive, I am proud of you.

Caster Semenya is not trans, but she got caught in the crossfire of trans women in sports.
I remember hearing about it in a vox video a few years ago about caster semaya(spelling might be wrong so apologies)
Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi are both cis women from Namibia that were banned from the Olympics due to this. I know there are more too
Haha true, I was trying to come up with a counter-example. I know that women are better at long distance swimming than men, I have been told it was due to bone density but I wasn't exactly sure if that was true.
Many trans women have low bone density before starting HRT. 

Want to elaborate a bit or??
Those structural things you stated really don‚Äôt change. But on HRT muscle strength does decrease and fat free mass changes. Everyone says that one thing outweighs another, but no one knows that for sure. If there was a study about trans women pre and post HRT body composition and swim time changes then people would point out the study, and no one has. Right now it‚Äôs all anecdotal and conjecture (bias).

You may be right in what you are saying: structural changes outweigh the physiological changes induced by HRT in competitive swimming, but you don‚Äôt know. Expectation and presumption are different.
Fractured skulls are common in MMA, she also lost plenty of fights
Like i said, needs more data. Though combat sports should probably have even stricter standards to ensure there isnt a gross mismatch.
Trans woman dominating beam would be really hard, because Beam is almost reliant on having a tiny frame, and female gymnasts frequently have delayed puberty.  

Trans man could concievably do well on the rings with the right amount of testosterone, but I don't even know how that would go.
Haha that would make sense and I would like to hope so üòÖ but honestly it‚Äôs impossible to tell these days when people are being facetious or just genuinely incredibly dense
Haha okay, I thought it might have been sarcasm, but also real TERFS usually have just as bad logic so it‚Äôs hard to say üòÖ
""But she does have male body frame, can we be honest in these discussions.""

*How* male is it?

""You are almost done developing when you are 20. It‚Äôs mostly the brain that continues to go through changes until 25.""

Is that true of both men and women? I gained an extra inch in height and two inches to my reach **after** turning twenty.

""Also just look at her on podium next to other contenders and tell me that they are built the same way."" She looks taller and broader, doesn't she? Well, we'd better look at any other woman who is taller and broader than those competitors and question their eligibility to compete.
""You can develop a male body frame by 20 that would have lasting advantages over people not born as male after hormones""

Hrt still has an effect on the bone structure after twenty years of age, your reply does not negate what I pointed out to you. You haven't demonstrated Lia actually has a cisgender adult male body frame.
Please read on the effects of feminizing hrt
Exactly and let's not even pretend the transphobs are worried about trans men. They only want to find another way to attack trans women
I'm sorry, let me clarify. You came in here to talk bullshit, and frequent a sub full of bullshit. No one here cares about what you think, have a terrible day üëãüèº
Unlike any trans women ever, Phelps did dominate his sport worldly for several years and studies on his Bodie do prove he has an unmatchable physical advantage... Over other men. Why is his career exalted but any trans women scrutinized to hell in the off chance they maybe come to dominate some sport, which never happened before?
>Michael Phelps has a small physical natural advantage over most men

His swimming speed tops off at 6 mph, while the average swimmer can only move at 2 mph.

When a transgender person, or well ok let's go straight to the heart of it trans women because bigots like who you are defending don't care about trans men, go through hormone replacement therapy. They loose bone mass, muscle mass, and almost every ""biological advantage"" is stripped away because of the HRT.
""Michael Phelps has a small physical natural advantage over most men""

A **small** advantage? Have you forgotten he's won 23 Olympic gold medals?
They were born with a baby‚Äôs body lol
Hm well I'm just going to disagree. I think that after transitioning trans women don't have overwhelming advantages because of male puberty. I know what TERFs say, and trans women choosing to not compete in sports is not going to make them any less transphobic. In fact it will be used as justification to their other arguments.
Ya, for me it's a tough decision because I see both of us as right, in my mind I have it as the majority of trans that I've met have no issue with competing so we should because that's what we want to do
You're not trying to ""educate yourself"", you made an argument.  


""Can we admit that even the strongest-fastest cis woman in her categod most likely lose against an average cis-man in any given sport?""  


No one is sure of the correct answers, but coming in making a blanket statement like that and completely missing the point of *why* I pointed out Michael Phelps as an example and using it to point out what's already understood, that many times and often people who are amab have physical advantages over people who are afab in sports, and at the same time using the words ""men"" to describe your arguments all felt pretty damn transphobic, and some of it just was, so please excuse my attitude because I need to get it under control more, but understand that you did, intentionally or not, cross lines.  


You can find reasons to keep people from competing that have nothing to do with gender easily, that was my point. I can point out all sorts of unfair advantages. For instance, why don't we point out how MLB allowed the 2017 World Series to be kept, or how the Russian skaters got to skate this year, despite using substances to enhance their abilities?  


Sports have never been fair. Keeping transgender people out of sports is mainly used as a means of discrimination. It's not truly a desire to keep sports fair, otherwise there wouldn't be Astros fans who are anti-trans women in sports, and are fine with what happened in 2017.
Oh so its totally fine that some people (especially in soccer fandoms) beat eachother up over a few dudes kicking around a ball ???? Im sorry but your view on this is absolutely pathetic in my opinion.
The Texas government is fascist. But being a bigot doesn't make you a fascist (i.e. you can have biases towards and negative feelings about a minority group without constructing an ideology around scapegoating and persecuting that group), and having a misinformed take doesnt make you a bigot.
Ah you edited the comment after I started replying XD
RIP me
In that 500 race, the 2nd place winner, Erica, was only around 3 seconds behind her. Never would call that a pool length.

Lia won 8th in her most recent 100 yard swim. She clearly has stiff competition with other women.

You're exactly reiterating my point that people like you only gripe when a trans person wins 1st place. And when you concern trolls gripe, all you can do is exaggerate.
I do go in that sub, yes, and disagree with the people in that sub regularly. Yeah im not self hating in anyway.
Good point though, people who really are heavily transphobic won't listen.
I've had good luck in other topics, the people who usually are just lightly misinformed and I can come to them with a more compassionate angle. I just need that myself, and try my best to change and find that.
Do you mean me or the troll? _is confused_

It‚Äôs an average across a population. No one is saying males are taller means that there are no short men. What a ridiculous statement. Based on that alone your other opinions are likely equally idiotic.
Yeah that really is one of the best things about climbing. It really is the ultimate sport. It takes literally every muscle in your body plus a huge amount of mental game that you just don't get in any other sport. I would highly suggest trying it if anyone here hasn't because for the most part climbing gyms are super accepting and are great places to hang out. also just need to give a shout out to my main girl Julia Duffy for making the USA climbing lead national team
But I don't have any inherent advantages though because most of climbings physical advantages comes from genetics in the form of your ape index and natural flexibly. Which btw are both things that women have a statistically higher chance of having. The only physical advantages I do have are in my flexibility because men and women put on muscle mass in very similar ways when it comes to climbing so not even that is an advantage. If you don't actually know stuff about a topic just let people live their lives and go back to your anime and manga subreddits
You're a whiny little bigot ... can you not understand that?
Yeah sorry I didn't make it clear what I meant. I was specifically asking more so that I could make more informed arguments in future more broadly than just from the trans perspective given it is relevant. Thanks for the heads up tho üôÇ
The story was that Caster Semenya was intersex and as a result of this had extremely high testosterone ‚Äî not even just ‚Äòhigher than average,‚Äô but three times what is typical for a woman.
Can i get a tldr on why, if she wasnt trans?  Im uninformed
I have met so many beefy men who think they can't float because of how dense their bones are and then had to teach them how to breathe from the diaphragm and how to lift upward with their hips so their legs wouldn't drag them down and how to rock the crown of their head back (for backstroke: the motion is kinda like looking up if you were standing).  So many of them try to lift their head with a ""looking down"" sort of motion.  

So on the note of density, the live human head is one of the heaviest parts of your body.  So when you shift the weight of your head such that it causes the rest of your body to sink: you sink.

With proper breath and posture, anybody can float.  A hippo can float.  The Titanic at one point could float.  The density of the steel in the Titanic was higher than that of human bones.

People don't think of these kinds of things.  They assume they must be sinking because of how awesome their physical features are.  It's *always* because they're doing it wrong.

I mean, this hasn't happened in biological male vs male or bio female vs female ever.*

We're just going to see more and more, increasingly grotesque injuries the more it continues.

*Edit: I made this claim before actually researching and I have found another case involving a cis male vs cis male.
Apologies I can't demonstrate this

You can see for yourself by looking?
You realize hrt doesn't change your body frame, right? The only thing it can do regarding your bones is decrease bone density.
Well their argument would simply be that they are using a performance enhancing drug and thus should t be allowed to compete. 
Edit: Under the assumption of a trans man taking testosterone, it is entirely possible to be trans and not be on hrt my apologies to those who have decided to not take that route.
Are you saying you think the advantages Michael Phelps ha Dover men are equal to the advantages he has over women?

Apologies, the word 'proved' in this thread is being used very loosely

It is clear by the times that Phelps advantages are much greater against those who were not born also born male
This is not true,

I am not a bigot, nor have I said anything bigoted, I am not interested in discussions of this nature

Most of Michael Phelps advantages come frmo his physical frame torso length etc,

This would not be changed by hormone therapy

While Phelps does have an advantage over men form his build he has a far greater advantage over anyone not born male

This is the false equivalency I have highlighted in the original comment replied to
Small advantage to most men compared to the size of the advantage he have over anyone not born as male as the rest of the comment clearly continues
I can see your point, and I respect the point you‚Äôre making. However, I think it‚Äôs incorrect to say that trans women don‚Äôt have overwhelming advantages. The reason that‚Äôs incorrect is because there‚Äôs no time or attribute bounding to that statement. Consider the edge cases. An untrained person will certainly end up closely comparable to a cis woman in athletic ability in a fairly short time like a year. However, consider a top trained genetically gifted male athlete who decides to transition. What is the threshold in which we say it is now fair for her to compete? That‚Äôs the unanswered question, and it has to be answered or every successful trans athlete will be used as fodder for anti-trans propaganda.
I do understand that I may have unintentionally crossed lines and I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs difficult to understand and to argue against people who are transphobic when you don‚Äôt have your facts straight or don‚Äôt have a science related degree, which is why I want to educate myself because I do feel trans issues matter and should be addressed properly. This being said, the last and only time I took biology was in high school and from what I‚Äôm reading in this sub it‚Äôs not appropriate to say biological male or biological female but the last time I and many people studied it, it was. Also, terms such as amab and afab are fairly new to me, so please excuse me for using men and women, because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned to use and I will know better from now on. Most other subs are there to hate and it enrages me when I can‚Äôt argue without facts or at least a perspective. I‚Äôm sure it will get easier with time as science reveals more facts and people become more educated but it‚Äôs really difficult when you don‚Äôt know where or who to reach without unintentionally offending people by using ‚Äútraditional language‚Äù (for the lack of a better term) or sounding overwhelmingly apologetic.
Where did I say committing crimes is okay??

But you‚Äôre telling people who love something, to get over it because it‚Äôs not that important anyways. Idk it‚Äôs very dismissive of people who have legitimate concerns about the fairness of a sport.

You‚Äôre telling a cis woman to not care about her missed scholarship, or missed opportunity at a swimming final; to just get over it. Even though Lia Thomas has a MASSIVE advantage over them. Even though there‚Äôs absolutely nothing they could do to compete against Lia.
We can see you yapping about ‚Äútranssexuals‚Äù being people who jump through every medical hoop cis people set for trans people only hours ago, don‚Äôt try to wriggle away from the truscum ideology you‚Äôre pushing. 

You might be able to lie to yourself about your self-hatred but it‚Äôs glaringly obvious to those of us who also went through the truscum phase when we were babytrans.
Of course, people who are *just* misinformed can become informed, but advocating for fewer rights isn't gonna help get people who actually *hate* us on board with trans rights in general.
The troll. You're good. :)
You do know oppression isn't a 1 or 0? There's varying levels to it. The racial oppression was disgusting, so was feminine oppression, gay oppression, and every kind of oppression. There's Trans people, OUR people out there being abused, mentally, verbally and physically, beaten to an inch of their lives or even killed just because they're trans. I'm a black trans woman, I know my history.

Fine then I don‚Äôt feel like looking up the ins and outs of rock climbing and I have no reason to question you so I‚Äôll give you that. There‚Äôs also sports like competitive shooting which I think woman should 100% be allowed to compete against men (if they want to). If you take the time to explain this to people instead of calling them a bigot you might be surprised how many people actually start to see things your way.

Now that being said, Do you apply that same rationale to sports that do actually give you an advantage just from being born a man and going through puberty as a man? For example, sports like weightlifting, running, or swimming? Since this post is about a swimmer do you believe being born a man and going through puberty as a man doesn‚Äôt give you an advantage in these sports? Do you think women should just accept the fact that someone that lived their first 20 years of their life as a man can come and dominate them in athletics because they decided to change genders? This is a giant middle finger to female athletes past, present, and future in my opinion.
I think their point is:

 Testosterone is one hell of a drug.
But, we do not know her full medical results nor whether all of the testosterone were bioavailabile or if some or most was being blocked in some way. There are many intersex conditions of those with even 46 XY chromosomes; the chief of which is Andrigen Insensitivity Syndrome whi can have enormous levels of testosterone that do not masculinse nor greatly benefit AIS women athletically.

Let's not forget humans are commonly considered a relatively monomorphic species on the basis of our low bodily sexual dimorphism such as the simple fact thay some women are bigger and stronger than some men, and not everyone is a man or woman to start with.  They often say men are stronger & more able to pass endurance fitness tests compared to average women, supposedly average men who are younger, their age, or older perform better on average... but those are averages & potentials for different forms. NIT everyone is highly dimorphic whether theyre athletic or not so it has been proposed that athletes could compete better in height & weight classes.

""You can see for yourself by looking?"" You need to show me measurements, just looking at her isn't in any way reliable. Then after you get her measurements you can compare them to measurements of her competitors, and Phelps.

Then after that do some proper research, then you might realise using Phelps as a comparison is also unreliable.
It can reduce the size of bone junctions, thus potentially thinning your frame, that's why trans women often shrink a few inches after a few years of hrt
Lmao that's not remotely the point because Phelps did not compete with women, the point is he did cause an unfair playing field in his category, for men because he is a man, and it was ""awesome"" for decades. There's isn't still not enough science to say for certain that trans women, specially playing by the rules imposed on them (which Lia does), have any advantage at all over cis women, all of the involved are women, her results seem to indicate that.
‚ÄúI am not a bigot, nor have I said anything bigoted‚Äù

You don‚Äôt get to decide that
Again, not the point, literally nobody is talking about a cis men compete with cis women, we are talking about trans women on long term hrt competing with cis women, there is a drastic difference, the Phelps exemplo when not taken into a non existent context, is reasonably equivalent because he is a cis man that compete with other cis men
""Small advantage to most men compared to the size of the advantage he have over anyone not born as male as the rest of the comment clearly continues""

Your original comment did not explicitly say this and you haven't given any evidence to support the *amendment* you made to your argument.
Phelps vs women is not a point
Ok you're right about the time in my comment but there are already time restrictions in practice so it's fine. From what I heard it's about 1 year of hrt when you start getting closer cis women's performance than cis men and after 2 years the average performance is about the same between trans and cis women.

Totally agree. 

Tone is super hard online, sorry if I sounded like someone sneakily trying to lay out transphobic talking points. Not my intent.
[removed]
I know that nothing in the OP‚Äôs post is oppression. Yes, our people are still being oppressed. I‚Äôve experienced some of that first hand. And when it‚Äôs real it‚Äôs awful. My problem is when teenage Tumblr trans people have such a hard-on for being marginalized that they have to resort to identifying triggers and micro-aggressions as oppression. Lia Thomas, in case no one noticed, is being permitted to compete. And I don‚Äôt know enough about her to know whether she has unfair advantages or not. But the idea that we can‚Äôt even DISCUSS the possible advantages of trans athletes or that doing so is ‚Äúviolence‚Äù (lol) is ludicrous. Some of the narratives that are popular in this community cheapen and delegitimize experiences of actual oppression. But if I were a self-important 15-year-old with zero real hardship maybe I‚Äôd be on that train. Alas, I am not.
[removed]
I think an even larger middle finger to the female athletes especially of the present is that they're largely not the ones arguing for trans women to be banned from their sports. And they'res also no evidence that even in sports like weightlifting that being mtf gives you an advantage. Trans people have been allowed in the Olympics ever since 2004 and it was only in the Tokyo Olympics that we saw our first trans Olympians. Including a female trans weightlifter. There basically was zero pushback from her fellow lifters but there was a massive amount of pushback from people outside of the sports. If this concern is actually genuine we should be looking at the data and not just going with a gut feeling and hoping it's correct. We should be letting the athletes themselves decide the rules of their sports not some old white guys who still think the us should be run based off the bible
Some measurements you can see by eye, I'm sorry I don't have exact figures and haven't been round her with a tape measure personally

It's pretty clear to see she is much taller and broader than average female build and is closer to average male build

I didn't bring up Phelps please put that point to the original comparer
>It can reduce the size of bone junctions

Notice how you didn't engage with anything I said. Your body frame is not your ""bone junctions"". Taking hrt won't significantly reduce the size of your bones.
And you do?

Please stay on topic instead of turning away from issue
How about you start by not being a misgendering troll, okay? That‚Äôs some self-hatred right there, to try to use something you think would hurt yourself on another trans person you disagree with. You might be saying dumb things but I‚Äôm not about to misgender you to try to make myself feel better. 

The first about three to five years of full time as your gender are the babytrans years, they‚Äôre roughly equivalent to the personal growth cis kids go through as teenagers. If you‚Äôve been out longer than that then fine you‚Äôre not a babytrans, you just haven‚Äôt grown as a person in that time. 

Just like being a teenager, being a babytrans is a very self-centred time. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, it‚Äôs totally normal when going through huge life changes like that. But when people turn self-centeredness into self-hate and find a group of other people encouraging them to keep focussing on that hate it stunts the personal growth. 

Plus my white what? Are you that desperate you‚Äôre going to assume my race for oppression olympics points? Just wow.
Considering the shit I've been called and treatment I've experienced, being ridiculed and etc. Yeah. Especially, considering this is bigot island
I disagree, you seeing these 'narrative' posts cheapen oppression is actually a narrative you're creating in your own mind and you're revolving around it. For example, you're saying ""we can't even discuss..."" No one said that, there's loads of posts that pop up here and everywhere about the subject and there'll continue to be. 

We need for band together and fight the oppressors, that's the whole point, no matter how 'light' the oppression is we still need to come together to do it. That's how we're going to get equal right, opportunities and treatment. So please support our brothers and sisters out there
You have serious issues. Your trans millennial ass still thinks trans zoomers have ‚Äúhad it easy‚Äù. When I haven‚Äôt motherfucker, my mental health is clinging by a thread thanks to Rowling‚Äôs Army of harassers and dogpillers.

Sports arent fair, there are cis swimmers built just like lia, that cis swimmer also holds records and broke her own record.. no one was close to her but no one whines about that, why? Cause she is cis. 

It's not about fairness, it's because she is trans. 

Is it fair that Micheal Phelps still gets to swim he clearly has so many advantages compared to other men who worked equally as hard as him.

She was an elite athlete and she still is.
I love your framing. \*can\* \*affect\* your frame. You didn't respond to the claim that they can't significantly reduce the size of your bones, because you know it's true, so you have to respond with a watered down meaningless version of your argument.

So, can you provide evidence that HRT significantly reduces the size of your bones?
I did not bring up Phelps

Please addres to original comparison that if trans are to be banned so should Phelps

I agree with you this is baloney
Oh yeah sweetie, you picked the exact right way to downvote farm in the trans subs, misgender them and then try to diagnose them! 

To everyone else, don‚Äôt downvote this one, that‚Äôs what they want. Their only connection with other humans is a negative number beside the deliberately anger inducing comments they post. Don‚Äôt give them the attention they want or they‚Äôll keep being jerks to others just to feel seen as a person.
Huh, thought it was a sock puppet or a truscum brigadier but turns out it‚Äôs just a run of the mill transphobe who uses the slur with two O‚Äôs. This one needs to get back to their green fuzzy farm I think.
Thanks, but no, not yet. I only recently got on hrt so it's gonna be a while

Sure dude whatever, bigger frame something something, does that translate in performance? As we are seeing with Lia Thomas, no, she won one race by 2 seconds, got her time beat on the same day later then on a following race she finished 5th, so how exactly is she the unbeatable monster you seem to suggest? I'm not really conceding the point because i answered it, the bone may not chance size but other factors matters to someone's size, I'm just tired of you people bullshit, that still doesn't defeat the fact she is not dominating anything and her results are evidence that there aren't any advantages

Cool? There are women that tower you, there are men shorter than the average woman. The average woman would lose against gifted athletes just as the average male would, that's how sports work. You go swim against those women I'm sure they'll smoke you again that's how sports work lol
My sister was a fashion model, she worked with cis women who were well over 6 feet tall.
>Sure dude whatever, bigger frame something something, does that translate in performance? 

Ah no, it doesn't at all. That's why Michael Phelps just happens to be 6'6 and have a significantly larger torso than legs, and has massive shoulders. That's just a coincidence

> As we are seeing with Lia Thomas, no, she won one race by 2 seconds

But she wasn't beating the male competitors in the male league by 2 seconds, was she? Far from it, correct? She was ranked 462nd.

>got her time beat on the same day later then on a following race she finished 5th, so how exactly is she the unbeatable monster you seem to suggest?

Literally nobody said she's an unbeatable monster. That doesn't have to be the case for there to be an unfair advantage.

>t? I'm not really conceding the point because i answered it, the bone may not chance size but other factors matters to someone's size

Bone structure and size is extremely important for sports, what are you talking about?

>that still doesn't defeat the fact she is not dominating anything and her results are evidence that there aren't any advantages

She went from rank 462 to rank 1 in a couple of years. How is that not dominating?
Boring transphobia is boring.
I've seen some amazing Transitions no matter the age, honestly. You got this girl!
[deleted]
You can't have both, either Phelps and Lia are unfair or neither are, are you willing to retroactively take all Phelps medals away?

She was ranking 50ish in the men's division before her transition, she kept competing in the men's division when she started hrt and that's when you can see her ranking plummetting to 400s, she is not number 1 amongst women, she won a singular race, that's very different
Okay so it's not about being gifted, it's purely because she is trans. There are CIS WOMAN SWIMMERS literally built just like her who also hold records than no one was close to, if they aren't banned it is purely because she is trans.
>You can't have both, either Phelps and Lia are unfair or neither are

No, lmao, that's not analogous at all. Some short men compete in the NBA. But no women, no matter how tall or skilled, compete in the NBA. The difference is pretty clear.

No, that's not a source. An actual database entry is a source.

My dad texted me a YouTube link to a Fox news story about a person who detransitioned	"I'm not even gonna state all the obvious implications of that. 


Does anyone know of a good video of a trans person talking about how much happier they are now transitioning? I'd like to text a link back. He didn't say anything, just sent a link. I'd like to do the same and send some trans joy back in his face ‚ò∫Ô∏è



**EDIT:** I thought I already had an edit to this post but it isn't showing up? Rip. 


Anyway


I did some thinking and decided to give my dad the benefit of the doubt and treat him like he's coming from a place of genuine love and concern and linked him some of the stuff you guys suggested. Worst case scenario he doesn't watch or read any of it and continues to be an ass. At least I know I tried and that he can't play the victim and say I was in the wrong.



I suspect I will get a lengthy text within the next hour or two about how I'm still wrong and not trans cause of course he knows me best (üôÑ) at THAT point I will just ignore him and say nothing. The nice thing is my dad takes ignoring as a ""win"" and doesn't pester or bring it up ever again usually



Also some info for those who might not have saw in the comments: I'm an adult in my mid 20s, my pronouns are he/him, and I'm a safe distance from my dad (we live in separate states) thank you all again SO much for your advice and concern. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è



**EDIT 2:** Well I woke up to this text from dad this morning. I don't even know how to respond üòê

""I am glad you understand where I am coming from. Am am glad you are happy. If it ever turn to not being so great and make you unhappy don't to afraid to change back. You have a good head on your shoulders and you think things thru. So if it make you happy then I am happy. But I am still going to refer to you as my little girl [deadname]...... unless you want to take the name we would have given you had you been born a boy ....... Travis James.""

**EDIT 3** Okay so I constantly forget that reddit doesn't know my backstory lmao I'm so used to posting on less anonymous sites. 

**Travis is NOT my chosen name. My name is Bucky**

I HATE that name. He KNOWS I want to be called Bucky. He is saying he will only call me my dead name unless I agree to his ultimatum and take the name he wants. It's just him still trying to control me"	"This is a really good summary page that can be handed off easily to people who try to push transphobic ideas:

tbh id just ignore it. He seems to already be twisting logic to fit the narrative he wants, so sending him back a text isnt going to change his mind.
[this is](https://youtu.be/YAHaVixgqew) a video interview with a detransitioner who isn't regretful about their transition experience. 

Really insightful imo
Or even just something breaking down the actual statistics around detransition. How rare it is - and how it‚Äôs often about societal pressure more than true regret

let Abigail speak for you
I think Jammi Dodger (idk spelling sorry) has talked about it on his youtube channel. hope it helps :(
send him an article on the high amount of divorce rates from straight couples compared to queer couples
I think there‚Äôs a statistic out there that most people who de transition do so bc they aren‚Äôt accepted by their community. If you can find that or a video that has ghat statistic w the source it might help
Well I made a YouTube video for my mother when she sent  me a fox news de-transion video.

I called it Transition Sabotage.

The only person who knows your gender and your needs is you. Some people do de-transion, and there's no shame in that. Most do it for social or economic reasons. Some are more happy in  between. Ash Hardel has a great YouTube on why they are nonbinary and has some nonbinary guest speakers who de-transioned a little.

This is hard enough for anyone to do, if you can, isolate yourself from anyone who would hold you back. That seems to be the best strategy.


https://youtu.be/5VylOdHBel0
No such thing as de transition, that‚Äôs just transitioning twice. Maybe your dad would like it if you changed your gender very often üòÇ worth asking
No one who sends fox news to someone is going to change their mind from being showed evidence that they're wrong. It's all about feelings regardless of facts which makes the whole ""facts don't care about feelings"", bs that much more ironic
Go to pubmed and send him a scientific article about the likely hood of someone  wanting to transition. Mabye ad the suicide rate of unsupported trans to drive the point home
My dad was listening to it in the car and it was about this girl who transitioned for clout points and then detransitioned because she obviously wasn't happy and mocked trans people and gender dysphoria and I wanted to tear my hair out. 

Then it went onto how masculinity levels in america are dropping and that you need to testical tan to solve this problem
Look up Ryan Cassata (may have spelled his surname wrong), he talks a lot about transitioning & his journey & his family's journey, he does a lot of public speaking & raises awareness about a lot of stuff & he's got a very ""this is Trans Stuff but phrased in a way that cis people can empathise with it if they wanna start understanding us"" type of vibe with most of his videos. I know he's got a spoken poetry thing where he addresses his dad & talks about how gender dysphoria feels for him, and he writes a lot of songs too.
""I've made my choice and don't need your input into my life, "" I would say to him.
I'd just text him back, ""thats great! I hope they're as happy as I'll be when I'm fully transitioned!""
My mom did the same, except it was a YouTube link on how TikTok makes mental disabilities a trend and attached to the link was a long message on how i couldn't be trans because she ""took classes on psychology"" and she ""would've seen the signs""

I saw you already sent some links, and i honestly might do the same. Maybe when I'm a bit older though, LOL
My dad printed out an article by a detransitioner and left it on the kitchen table with a note saying ""very interesting read""
You know, subreddits like this are usually ""drop the abusive bastard now and never talk to him again"".

I'm going to say what I've said before - if there's a chance his transphobic ass will turn around and respect you and love you, it might be worth waiting for. You're on your own and safe in your own place, and can text him from a safe place and not dig in deeper than you have emotional energy for.

One of my brothers used to be transphobic, but all I'll say is now he's the only family I have anymore, and he's a damn good ally.
Sam Collins, and Jammiedodger are one of my favorite trans YouTubers. This should help
Nice, just got it
I've found an interesting video of a person who detransitioned but is really happy that they had the experience. They really considered it two transitions vs. detransitioning, IIRC. Depending on the theory of gender that most applies to you, nothing to say that you might decide to transition again in the future. Or continue one long transition. Or do stops and starts.  I think all of that should be okay to do. I'm genderfluid so I think about this stuff lol. I'll try to find the link.
if the possibility of detransitioning makes it too risky to allow a child to transition, you would also have to prove that it isn‚Äôt possible to prevent the accident transitioning of non-trans people. unfortunately for people like your dad, this really doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case.

most detransitioners arise from a very specific set of preventable circumstances. if you don‚Äôt want your kid to accidentally think they‚Äôre trans but really aren‚Äôt, the best thing to do is love them and then get them the best possible trans healthcare from some real experts
Just send him 100 gecs songs

I think I may have seen the same article. Screw Fox. I find that with trans issues, they always go with half truths, twist the facts, don‚Äôt say all the facts, lie, create an emotional narrative against trans rights, and/or blow things out of proportion. They always try to find a way to make being pro-trans a bad thing and they spread so much misinformation and hate. Unfortunately my parents listen to Fox a lot.

I know I'm a bit late, but here's a study you could link (sorry, not a video, but arguably better). 

[Factors Leading to ‚ÄúDetransition‚Äù Among Transgender and Gender Diverse People in the United States: A Mixed-Methods Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/)

> Of those who had detransitioned, 82.5% reported at least one external driving factor. Frequently endorsed external factors included pressure from family and societal stigma. History of detransition was associated with male sex assigned at birth, nonbinary gender identity, bisexual sexual orientation, and having a family unsupportive of one's gender identity. A total of 15.9% of respondents reported at least one internal driving factor, including fluctuations in or uncertainty regarding gender identity.

Feel free to read through it for more understanding, but what it mostly comes down to is that people detransition because of pressure from family and/or society. My math might be wrong here, but it looked like the total number of people in the study that detransitioned because **they** wanted to, is something like 2-3% of the trans people they surveyed.
I heard recently that most people who detransitioned were pressureed by those around them and how poorly treated them for being trans.
If your dad is a fan of some sport or has a hobby, send him a link of someone disliking the sport or hobby for some reasons.
Honestly just look at so many trans people online or im documentaries. I'm trans, ive been out since i was 12 and now im 18. I love being called a man, or being seen as a male. The euphoria i get every single time is unreal. I would transition in a heart beat if travelling and funds weren't so difficult for me
Just text back an image of a middle finger
I'll call your dad up and tell him about how my life is so much better now.

I stopped transition for several years (although I didn't consider it ""detransitioning"" more like just a pause) and within a couple years I looked more or less exactly like I did before hormones. My voice was a little different but even it kind of went back to what it started at.

So even if someone DID regret transition, it is relatively easy to reverse everything with a little time. Surgery is a little harder to reverse obviously, but that's why you should always do so much soul searching, therapy, and research before taking those steps, as pretty much every trans person does anyway. The pearl clutching of conservatives is tedious to watch because they can't even be bothered to actually educate themselves on the whole process in the first place or they would know that their fears are utterly misplaced and emerge from vitriolic propaganda coming from the christofacist media. 

This talking point from conservatives about ""transition regret"" is just such blatant concern trolling. The facts are clear that 99% of people don't regret it, and of those that do its almost always because of the increase in transphobia they then face. Transition related surgeries have a MUCH lower regret rate that knee replacement surgery, but you don't see fox talking about that.

Potential regret is simply not a justification for keeping people from life saving medical care. I'm sorry you're dealing with a non-accepting dad!
I‚Äôd take a few
Minutes and maybe find something from Dr. Z. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve seen a video she‚Äôs done that talked about either family struggling to accept or even how much happier once you‚Äôve come to terms with who you really are. Maybe even one where she addresses how you know if you‚Äôre really trans‚Ä¶ 

It‚Äôs not hateful, and she‚Äôs a licensed psychologist with a specialty in gender.
I hate people like this.

I understand thats your father and stuff, but seriously dude, you should put that man in his fucking place even tho he's a relative, because thats some insensitive shit.

what your dad did wasn't wrong, he was trying to show you how actions also have consequences.

denying the reality of detransitioning by not listening to their stories, isn't that also invalidating their experiences?

you really should consider your transitioning and what that means wholly to you, your environment and the people around you in all sphere criteria.
Unfortunately if he can send you something like that then whatever you do won't change his mind. The best thing I can think of is let him know about the cold hard facts about life expectancy of trans people depending on whether family members provide an accepting and safe environment, compared to those that don't.

Also mention that if there was a medical treatment that had a 99% success rate it would be fucking worldwide good news. But hey, if your dad can only think of the <1% that detransitioned, possibly due to societal  pressures, then that's his problem.

Sorry for the rant.
Ignore him. He's being an ass
I de-transitioned for a few years because I couldn‚Äôt get the healthcare I needed and I regretted every day of it I mean I got some of my life together again but the dysphoria as well as the sense of shame and alienation from myself and my past was intolerable and I have decided to re-transition. De transition was not a solution but accepting myself was.
About 2% of the people who [detransition](https://fenwayhealth.org/new-study-shows-discrimination-stigma-and-family-pressure-drive-detransition-among-transgender-people/) do it because they question their transgender identity. De-transitioning doesn‚Äôt improve quality of life for most people. Ask your dad if he cares about your happiness and quality of life or if he cares about how people might view him for having a trans child.
I mean you could be petty and if he is still married to your mom you could send him any news article about people getting divorced.

Jesus christ my mom sent me that exact video yesterday
Plenty of detransitioners have retransitioned. Often the detransing is due to social pressure such as stories like this in the media. BUT the point you can use from this is that anyone can detransition if transitioning doesn‚Äôt feel right, including you. You‚Äôll know it if you need to, but haven‚Äôt yet.
Weird suggestion, but maybe Blaire white would be a good bridge. While she talks about people who detransition, she also emphasizes how much transitioning helped her and how happy she is living her life as a woman. My opinions on her are very mixed (she‚Äôs starting to really show a lot of her right wing true colors and I‚Äôm increasingly bothered by her covid denial and worried her beliefs could shift from genuine concern for children to qanon level conspiracy) but she speaks to people with his kind of perspective and shows as an actual real life trans person that trans people aren‚Äôt the pedophilic boogeyman they‚Äôre made out by the right to be.
Here's a vietnam vet talking about his trans son

Just send a pride flag image back
Literally anything out there, you can find something to back up a specific narrative. Even if 99.9% of people who transition are thrilled with it, there's always going to be someone for whom it wasn't right, and fine, good for them. 

I know loads of trans folks, none of whom have de-transitioned. 

I had to stop at one point because it was 20 years ago, and I just didn't have the support or the money to continue, but it didn't mean I didn't want to. For people who have de-transitioned, they all likely have their own individual reasons why, and that doesn't translate to your experience.
[Jamie](https://youtube.com/shorts/rQo5IEKRED8?feature=share) just posted a short!

If it helps, I'm sitting in the waiting room for my orchi right now and I'm so excited. Seriously. No man could possibly be half this excited about losing their testicles. Seriously giddy.
I came to this sub to see if anyone else was talking about this video. My religious mom also sent me this video this morning.

I am not trans so I can't give her any personal experience but I just want to give her the tools to see it from another perspective. Obviously, her info is coming from Fox, so that says a lot right there. But I know she is open to hearing about it.

She lives in her bubble but the conversation started last week because she just found out my brother's girlfriend (cis female) does drag. That was a whole lot for her to process but it did open the door to lots of questions for her. She thought only men did drag and I explained all kinds of people do. 

Based on our conversations, I don't think she's anti trans, but more so anti starting kids too young on hormones. I'm not going to pretend like I know anything about it because, like I mentioned, I don't really have a lot of personal experience. Every trans person I know (that I know of) transitioned socially or medically as an adult. I think every situation is unique and so personal.

I wanted to bring the question here. I know other people just say to ignore it, but I do want to send something her way. If she wants me to watch what she offers up, I want to give her something too.
Studies vary but I found this one https://www.ustranssurvey.org/informes#USTS . They have a section about detransitioning and found out that about 8% detransitioned, of that 8% only 11% detransitioned because they found out it wasn't for them. Other reasons were social stigma, pressure from parents or relatives to de transition, financial problems and or work problems, others detransitioned but planned on continuing in the future. If you look at other studies you will see similar reports. No treatment works 100% of the time but it doesn't mean we should discourage people from transitioning just because a small percentage deteansitioned for whatever reason.
Oh boy, the Christmas after I came out my parents gave me Gay Girl Good God. Talk about cringe. Anyone have good rebuttle books that I can start being petty too and send over?
Literally any trans youtuber
So. As much as you‚Äôd probably want to ignore him, or say something smartass‚Ä¶maybe educate him. Send him a quick article or link. There are a TON showing that trans members of society who aren‚Äôt allowed to transition are at a much higher rate of suicide. Is your mental health worth his pride? Theres also a lot out there showing that the rate of people who regret transitioning are lower than people who have common procedures, such as knee surgery. Nobody goes around telling people, ‚Äúahh Mike, I know your osteoarthritis is bad in the left knee, but there‚Äôs a 20% chance you‚Äôll regret the knee replacement!‚Äù
It might be helpful to inform him that fox news has an obligation to entertainment, not news.
Jammidodger and Sam Collins both make YouTube vids . Jammi does seem to go into more detail though.
Alternatively you could ignore it.
I dunno if this would help but heres a ted talk from a father about coming to terms with and then celebrating his trans son.

https://youtu.be/GW8Plf_IXGs

Edit: its been a couple years since i‚Äôve seen this and i forgot that he uses she/her to refer to his son pre transition which is üò¨üò¨ 
Some if his takes are outdated but I think the vid stuck with me after I watched it bc I‚Äôd never seen a conservative parent be ok with their trans kid like that
Tell him that divorce is like ten times more likely to happen than someone choosing to detransition. Lmao
Send Never Gonna Give You Up :) 

If not, maybe PhilosophyTube? https://youtu.be/AITRzvm0Xtg

You could always dump some Contrapoints stuff.
\[Here are some excellent statistics on detransition\]([https://www.gendergp.com/detransition-facts/](https://www.gendergp.com/detransition-facts/)). It may be worth pairing this with anecdotal evidence of trans people who have been positively effected by transition - good examples are Ashley Adamson and Rose Montoya (vloggers that focus on positive aspects of the trans experience). There have been lots of studies on how conservative people are more swayed by anecdotal evidence.

Answer: all live decisions carry a chance of regret.
just link him an article about a car crash and tell him he should never drive again
Hope they got links to parenting classes and referrals to therapists in return.

Wow that very last edit really ended powerfully
Op I'm glad your father is more supportive now
Thank you.
Thank you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hey, can u dm me a link to this bc it will be rly helpful for anyone who questions my identity. 
Also sorry you had to go through that, it's so horrible (btw this is for the original post incase u r confused)
OMG this is exactly what I need. I‚Äôve been arguing with my parents about beginning HRT for the past year and GNC for the past 2. They say they just want to wait till I‚Äôm older but all my friends have started and Im feeling left outtt!!! 
Maybe this will finally convince them!
Tysm for this!!
Saving for when I come out to my dad and inevitably going to need something to send to him
This is excellent, thank you üôè
Then why do so many of them sewer slide
LMAOOO ty
Rofl yeah. I second this. Never respond to trolls with logic. Either don't respond or troll right back. But if you do troll, do it the trans way: *gayly.*
Omg oli love that so cute
Seriously. Because apparently they are trading things that are very irrelevant and silly. Least that's how I view what he sent em as lol
**I love you!**
Omg I might just watch it all
Mitchiri Neko!  The perfect Troll Repellent!

Disagree.

This is true. It's frustrating because when I initially came out he WAS watching vids of successful trans people who are happy being trans but now he's suddenly getting all his sources from fucking fox üò≠ wtf happened
Exactly. He doesn‚Äôt care
Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I do have a pic of a break down of statistics that show the actual percentage of detransitioners that simply regretted it was the smallest amount. Maybe I'll just bombard him with a ton of links and info üòÇ I know he won't take them seriously but it would get a point across
Just watched the whole video and it was amazing wow ü•∫ I love that she acknowledged how people expect you list all the things you did as a kid that indicated being trans because my dad keeps jumping all over me for not acting masculine enough as a child to justify being trans now
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbhv1Znv4Lk) might be the video! It's from April 2020. Jammi always impresses me with how well he understands the research around topics. 

His channel is a great resource for people who don't know much about the trans community. He has a way of mixing humour with facts that alleviates the tension commonly found in these discussions! OP, I hope things get better. I know this isn't an easy situation. Best of luck.
This is extra funny because my dad divorced my mom because he was cheating and has cheated on every single woman he's been with ever since ü§≠
I have a screenshot of a study with those stats! 5% of people de transitioned because they found it wasn't right for them while 36% stopped because of their parents. Idr the amount of people surveyed but I'm pretty sure I downloaded the giant 100+ page pdf of the research simply cause I know my dad ain't gonna pour through a whole document like that lol
Thank you so much for this!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è It sucks but at least we can find solidarity with parents who use Fox as a news source lmao
We've already had a conversation about detransitioners and what would happen if I stopped and I explained that the only permanent changes are body hair and voice change but in either case I can't imagine a universe where I would be unhappy with that because I've always wanted a deeper voice and more body hair if nothing else lmfao
I guess I'm constantly torn on what to do bc some trans people tell me to cut him out whereas others keep making me feel guilty for not viewing this as genuine concern from a place of love. Ik no one knows my dad but these types of things always make me doubt myself....which is a trait I definitely got because of how my dad treated me my whole life üòÖ
[removed]
YIKES that's sounds awful I'm sorry about that ü§¢üò¨
Thank you for the rec!! ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
Everyone has such good suggestions I'm having a hard time figuring out my best course of action lol
Omg I'm sorry you got a crazy parent too üò≠ the signs thing is so fucking insane why are they so obsessed with that
Oh my GOD. üò≠ What a fucking asshole lmfao
god that is such a boomer thing to do lol
Someone linked a video that was about 45 minutes of a person saying they were on T for 6 years and had recently stopped but didn't regret it or anything, maybe that's the one you were thinking of? I haven't had time to watch it all yet. If not that's at least 2 videos that don't paint it as something negative :)
Oh gosh thank you for all of these!!
Ikr? üòñ I didn't watch the vid he sent but I read like 3 comments before I absolutely couldn't read anymore. I mean it's insane. 

I also will forever find it funny that, aside from weaponizing de transitioners, people like my dad will be like ""I want to know more about trans people. Allow me to gather all my sources from cis people who purposely make trans people look bad and had never transitioned. Surely, these cis gendered people  who hate trans people have reliable knowledge on the subject"" 

It's like asking someone who hates baking, and specifically only bakes disgusting cakes, to bake a delicious cake for your birthday party.
I did send him a thing that shows the statistics show that most people de transition because of parents/other social reasons
LMAOO ü§£
Thank you for this insightful comment! The concept that you MIGHT regret something is such a stupid reason not to do something imo. Unless it's like, I might regret eating a snack at 3am ü§£

All I know is I'm 10 months into hrt and there is not a shadow of doubt or regret so far!
I KNOW RIGHT ok I'm glad you understood that edit cause some people thought it was cute and I forgot that no one knows my name on here ü§£ I'm way too used to Twitter and not being anonymous haha 


It's funny and stupid because my name should be one my dad of all people would like lmfao he just wants to control me. I was really busy today so I never texted him back but um yeah I am simply not going to respond if he doesn't call me the right name. It's so disrespectful on the most basic level to call someone the name YOU want to call them
I watched that one !! It's so good
Ikr like wtf you can't give me an ultimatum about my IDENTITY bro üò≠ in the past he was like ""why can't you just bind and wear a fake beard and be a girl"" üòê
I can't tell if you're being a troll and saying trans people are all making a huge mistake or just me but neither is true. Also you couldn't know this but I've explained to my dad at length how I've felt this way and took years to decide if I was ever going to transition. Ive also given him plenty of sources and always answer any questions or concerns kindly. I am doing my best but the fact is he doesn't want to understand or be supportive and that is not you love and care for a child. It just alienates me.
Okay so I constantly forget that reddit doesn't know my backstory lmao I'm so used to posting on less anonymous sites. Travis is NOT my chosen name. I HATE that name. He KNOWS what name I want to be called. He is saying he will only call me my dead name unless I agree to his ultimatum and take the name he wants. It's just him still trying to control me

EDIT: deadname* not dadname lmao
I mean not really he told me he will only call me my deadname unless I pick that ugly ass travis name. I forgot to include it but my name is NOT Travis and I never want that to be my name lmao
Sure, I just sent you the link.
Facts don't matter. He's looking for confirmation of pre-existing opinions. If you showed d him the detransition rate is 1-2% and a chunk of that is social in nature, not medical, so we have 98%+ trans people are happy with their transition he would find another bullshit story to counter it. It's sadly a waste of your time.

You could say something like ""good for them, I'm glad they figured out who they were. It's hard to come out, it's hard to transition, it's also got to be hard to detransition. Luckily only 1-2% of people that transition feel that it wasn't the right choice. In general people should be given the opportunity to figure themselves out, with support and care and understanding, right daddio?"" or 10 hours of cats, whatever you think works best lol.
That wud be funny if she sent that lol
My heart belongs to the cat parade ‚ù§Ô∏èüôâ
Is he religious? Cuz if so, Christianity happened. Religion will turn a person's brain to fucking mush.
my only reply would be ‚Äúfox news? Seriously? Fox News? You couldn‚Äôt do any better than this? Fox News? Honestly come on now.‚Äù 

Don‚Äôt even try and explain why. Just completely discredit the source and let him process needing to find a source of information if he wants to have real discourse with you.
He sounds like the type who would say ‚Äúlisten to both sides‚Äù as a copout so he can agree with the side that feeds his preexisting biases instead of growing as a person. 

Tbh he‚Äôs being a massive asshole. He should be listening to you, not some Uncle Toms who Fox News dug up. If he wants more perspectives he should be listening directly to trans people, not the favorite examples of an entertainment outlet that hates us. 

I‚Äôm really sorry. If you‚Äôre old enough I‚Äôd recommend cutting him out of your life before any more of his disgusting views seep into you.
I don‚Äôt presume to know your relationship with your parents but I‚Äôve definitely been careful with mine to add something like - ‚ÄúI know that any of the emotions you are feeling around this are because you love me and you want the best for me, but‚Ä¶.‚Äù Insert argument.


My experience is that any defensiveness that they have often stems from thinking that we aren‚Äôt aware that they are acting from a place of love. Worry is a shitty way to express love. But it‚Äôs sort of natural for many parents. 

Anyway, addressing that maaaaay bypass some defensiveness. May not. Just thought I‚Äôd offer
yeah, ofc <3
I second this. Jamie's 10 year transition video always makes me tear up and it's clear how much happier he is nowadays :D
another fun article to send! ‚Äústatistics for how many men cheat on their spouse‚Äù
Welp there‚Äôs also the option to be passive aggressive. Depending how petty u wanna be u could send the whole study and say something like ‚ÄúI can sum it up for you if you need to, it needs actual reading comprehension‚Äù
Isnt bottom growth also permanent?
Honestly what's best for you isn't for other people to decide, but you yourself.

I personally will be going no contact the instant that I can do so. Completely and totally, I value respect and my personal autonomy, and I have plenty of people who love me and respect me so I don't really feel any need to be around my relatives who do their best to bring me down.

But realistically you do need to at the very minimum set boundaries or you're just going to end up with a lot more emotional pain than needed. Like if you don't want to cut him out then it's probably in your best interest to set real boundaries with actual consequences or the behavior will not change and you'll just have to continue to deal with the disrespectful hateful nonsense he's sent you.
Uh I'm not suicidal at all fyi but someone reported me saying that I was. Hope it was not because of this comment
My parents have been relatively supportive to my coming out, but I have many trans friends whos parents are nothing short of evil, so I unfortunately have a lot of experience in this department :( if you want to talk about course of action I'd love to, i like helping people :D
I have no clue üò≠üò≠
I think it's about the same person but this is her personal YouTube channel. [Alia's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/AliaIsmail)
Exactly
Ohhhhh well that is a completely different story then. My parents pulled similar and I just kept passively correcting and annoying them it hasn't fully worked. I hope it goes better for you eventually
That is true
Op uses he/him btw
He's not but he is republican so I guess it was inevitable. It just sucks cause despite that we had multiple conversations that sounded like he was really starting to understand me and trans people in general:/ I was weary but of course everyone tells me I need to be fair/show some grace and give him time to understand and accept this. But the more time passes, the LESS accepting he is. 


My mom is the heavy Catholic but even she is making an effort.
Yet, most scholars study things like religion and some of the great literatures of the old and new world are religious texts or influenced by. Maybe, its something else.
He's such a hypocrite because he's always crying about biased news sources and it's like my brother in Christ you watch FOX NEWS!!!
It is! Tho tbh I've barely had much of that and also feel weird discussing genitals with my dad so I didn't say much on that I don't think. I mentioned it happened but he's so dumb he probably doesn't even know what or where the clitoris is ü§£ much less how it could grow
Thanks homie üòî‚ù§Ô∏è I'm just gonna have to set an aggressive boundary which is hard for me. I always feel bad correcting people for some reason üòì sorry you have a difficult time too
OK sorry
Sounds like your dad has fallen to the conservative cult. Unfortunately, my entire family is in that cult and there is no way that I know of to get them to see the light. My mom told me I was going to hell and my dad compared me to a pedophile when I came out, so I'm right there with you.
That just gives red flags. Sounds like he MIGHT be engaging in terf or GC spaces if he's gradually getting less and less supportive. Caelan Conrad made a very extensive 3 part video series about this, they had a section in the first or second video about parents who want to learn how to support their trans child but end up getting sucked into GC communities. If you have the energy for these videos it's a very interesting watch/listen although highly triggering.

I don't really have any advice when it comes to this cause transphobes will turn anything you say against you to shut you up and make you stop being trans and it's really hard to reason with. But I wish you the best of luck, hang in there bud.
Not to say that there aren't definitely Republicans like this, but I am a republican and I'd never think of sending that to someone I claim to care about, I wouldn't even send it to someone I hate, because everyone, even those who are garbage, deserve the common decency of not being an ass for no reason, but if you find a link (I'm sure there's thousands out there) I'd definitely send one, because all you're doing is putting the shoe on the other foot, and there's nothing wrong with that, stay strong Royal figure (not sure how you identify but if I were to guess I'd say male?) And know that you're loved, and amazing
My parents are p liberal but they send me stuff like this too all under the ‚Äûwe just want you to be safe‚Äú because look people regret it so you will too. Very frustrating
Just say ‚Äúfox news is the conservatives equivalent of CNN‚Äù and watch his brain twist itself into knots
Shit. That fucking sucks. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Sorry that happened to you üòî honestly with all the type of things fox news reports and I'm surprised he hasn't accused me of being a pedophile yet üôÑ he still has stuff of mine (I moved to a diff state) so I want those things back but after that I'm probably just gonna stop talking to him after that. I don't want to unload a bunch on you but my hope is I can find someone to come with me so I don't have to see him in person all alone
Mine wanted to die, so there‚Äôs that. Idk what‚Äôs worse.

Oh wait, I‚Äôm still in the closet after 5 1/2 years.
I doubt this will give you comfort but just know that there are Republicans and conservatives who are trying to get in and change views on certain things, and who do want the LGBTQIA+ community to feel loved and safe
Thank you ü•∫ it's ironic that they say the trans cult makes you trans but they are the cult that's making people hateful. 

Luckily, my dad and I live in separate states. It's not super far but it's a long enough drive that he's not gonna put in the effort to just show up or something. So I think I'll just send a text of stuff I would genuinely like any supportive family member to watch to better understand me and just be like. Listen. I know what this biased news sources are saying and I'm not changing my mind. You can either be supportive or you can get lost ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Thank you sm! ü•∫ Also ur correct I'm a trans guy haha so King is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è



Tbh I was just saying this to a friend. My dad is heavily Republican in that he always listens to Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, fox news, etc, totally buys into everything, always votes red, etc. He digs his heels in on most topics. But I don't think he hates trans people in that he would be loudly agreeing with the current events surrounding trans people. I don't think he cares enough about trans people generally existing to hate all of them. A Republican candidates views on trans people isn't a deciding factor for him (I don't think mf doesn't even think trans ppl are real lol) 



The problem is now he has a trans CHILD and that simply CANT be right cause he ""KNOWS"" his kid! This is less about how wrong trans people are and more about how it shouldn't be directly affecting him, ykwim? So he will use his sources to try and convince me I'm of the population of trans folks who will ultimately regret this and cry to my dad about how he should've stopped me or something weird like that.
I'm used to it now. I've learned that my family only really loves the version of me they have in their heads, not the real me. They only love me so far as I can make them look like good parents/ siblings. In fact, the only family that supports me is my brother who is also estranged from the rest of my family, so now we found solidarity in being the outcasts.
So sorry, you‚Äôre going through this.

If you send anything back, not likely to this, show him C. Jenner (no idea how to spell that gal‚Äôs name, but basically that transwoman who hangs with Terfs x/ ) on that channel. 

Like if they‚Äôre soooooo convinced on all the crap they say, why keep on a trans person. Let alone the major benefits they give their LGBTQAI+ employees.

(The answer to rhetorical question because want to include sources for anyone who needs a springboard for those dealing with ‚Äúred-pilled‚Äù family members and/or dealing with gaslighting) 

One reason that I can see is because anti-trans/LGBTQAI+ speech it‚Äôs all profitable clickbait and they believe/know their viewers are dumb. Carlson even admitted on a far-right podcast that he lies to his viewers for ‚Äútheir own good.‚Äù And Fox‚Äôs lawyers say he can‚Äôt be believed 

https://www.npr.org/2020/09/29/917747123/you-literally-cant-believe-the-facts-tucker-carlson-tells-you-so-say-fox-s-lawye

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tucker-carlson-admits-lying-on-show_n_613fb9bee4b09519c5085ebd

Even the mask/vaccine mandates are uber strict at Fox despite all the anti-mask rhetoric/vaccine rhetoric.

And then there was the incident of them recommending hormone therapy as a cure to Covid.

https://www.thedailybeast.com/ivermectin-fans-are-back-with-even-weirder-drugs-for-your-covid-19-including-hormone-therapy

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/fox-corp-staffers-are-fed-up-with-fox-news-hateful-lgbtq-coverage

These links should also have links to original sources. And ‚ÄúAnchorman 2‚Äù is basically a satire making fun of how Fox got started in the first place, including being set up by an Australian businessman.
I‚Äôve only recently discovered myself, but am terrified to open up to my family
There most certainly is. Unfortunately I was stereotyping hard, I apologize for that. Unfortunately the republicans and conservatives that get all the airtime and are the loudest are the worst ones. There are good people in most groups and that includes conservatism.
This is weird to say but I'm so glad to hear you don't live with your dad hahaha! I was worried. Still sucks but oh goodness does that take a weight off one's shoulders. I can't begin to imagine how awful trans kids have it when they still live with their unsupportive families... (I came out to myself and my close circles after I moved out for college, everyone is ok with it so I've had it easy on that part honestly)

But yeah I think that's the best way to go with unsupportive people... Setting that boundary and the consequences of breaking that boundary (for example restricting or completely cutting contact) + following through those consequences is very important. Sometimes it's the only way parents will realize that they do still want their child in their life and so they have to do the work to keep them in their life.
It seems that in his weird little world he's trying to protect you, so at least you know he loves you in his own weird way, not that it matters because he's actively hurting you in doing this
Thanks so much for all of this! It's so weird how they openly admit to lying to rile people up and it still works üò≠ 

It's been a long time since I watched anchorman 2 but kinda wanna watch it again now that you say that ü§£
Good luck!
I agree, and I wish that those of us who want people to feel seen and loved could get some as well
I'm definitely VERY lucky wrt being openly trans and coming out and all that. I went to art school in a very progressive town with a lot of other openly trans kids, so I was also out to close friends who accepted me without question. I did however wait to move to a new state to come out to my family and start HRT, specifically because of my dad. Before now I was living in our family house alone but paying my dad rent. I definitely wanted out of that situation as fast as possible cause I did NOT need my dad to hold also being my landlord above my head. Plus he would just show up unannounced all the time ü•¥

I feel a lot of guilt and that's because my two siblings stopped speaking to my dad for personal reasons. I mean aside from transphobia he isn't a good dad to his 1 cishet daughter lol. He's definitely a narcissist. I feel a lot of pressure though cause I'm the last kid he talks to and I'm afraid he might go beserk or something if all his kids cut him off. I know it's not my responsibility but would my mom and her family understand that? And I'm afraid of the whole extended family turning me into that villainous trans kid that hates his parents for not immediately accepting him without question. Again I KNOW it would be probably better to cut them all out but I have a really BIG family yanno? üòì Idk sorry for venting so much haha
Yeah I did reply to him and just gave him the benefit of the doubt that it comes from a good place. my dad shows many narcissistic tendencies and in those cases everything they do is ""out of love"" even if it's really messed up traumatizing shit. Neither of my siblings talk to him and they arent when queer so probably says a lot more than I could. He treats each of us in very specific ways. Ex I'm the golden child, or I was. It's a very weird boat to be in. The golden child who terrifically failed and disappointed his dad üòÇüòì
Will Ferrell is great! 

He actually started out as a journalism major too. Anchorman and Talladega Knights are part of what he calls the ‚Äúmediocre man‚Äù trilogy which is designed to be satire of white, cishet male privilege from a white, cishet male ü§£ 
(And wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it also informed his George W. Bush parody on SNL)
Hey man that's ok don't be sorry for venting, that's quite a lot you got on your shoulders yeah. ü•∫ I'm glad you're in a place where your dad holds no power over your livelihood. That said he sounds like a god awful human being lol and it's definitely not your responsibility to keep in touch with him if it's affecting you negatively and he won't do anything to improve. Cutting him out doesn't mean you have to cut out your whole family, and while you could explain to them why you did, you also don't owe them any explanation if you don't want to explain yourself. 

You said your mother was making an effort to support you, wasn't she? You should keep building on that and guide her through learning to properly support you as a trans person, same for extended family members who are supportive. You might not be able to stop rumors from spreading and bigots from being bigoted, but despite it you can upkeep good relationships with people who genuinely care about you, will make effort to be good to you and will stand for you no matter what. I really don't know what your relationship with your extended family is, but you have the right to pick and choose who gets to be in your life, how often you see them, what you talk about and etc., and who doesn't get to be in your life at all.

Under Texas law, I'm now considered a sex offender. See y'all when I'm out of prison.	"Edit: I was slightly misinformed at first. The law hasn't passed passed, it has up to now *only* passed the senate. Somehow that doesn't make me feel entirely better, but here's hoping the house still has some sense. It passed the Senate 20-11. I also found out today the guy who created the bill is a senator in the same city as me. He's literally MY rep. How did I get so lucky?

To my knowledge the law hasn't taken effect yet but it did pass. But it's worded ambiguously on purpose, like most laws are, enabling the enforcers to discriminate at their discretion whatever poor sap they choose. This law in particular bans drag ""performances"" in any public space where a child might potentially see it, including in grocery stores or restaurants. It goes on to define ""drag"" as anyone who dresses or presents in a way that doesn't ""match"" their biological sex assigned at birth. According to the law, simply wearing ""women's clothes"" when you're ""biologically a man"" could be construed as ""drag"". It goes deeper, also including other typically gendered ""accessories"" such as long hair on a ""man"", makeup or having your nails done. What does this mean in practice? It's simple. I could be seen as grooming kids, and arrested for it, for simply having makeup on when I go to the grocery store. My options? Keep doing what I'm doing and hope nothing bad happens (this is what I choose) or get scared, let the fascists win and just conform and comply, let my gender dysphoria return with a vengeance when it's finally starting to dissipate, and probably before too long, return to suicidal ideation. (This is not what I choose) Aren't you guys glad we live in the freest country in the world?"	"Start reporting Republican women when they wear pants
I am speechless. In which universe is the wearing of clothes related to grooming?
Keep the ACLU contact handy: [https://www.aclu.org/affiliate/texas](https://www.aclu.org/affiliate/texas)
Call fhe cops on every priest wearing a robe. After all that's a dress. Maybe they'll even find actual grooming going
Easy solution, get all the menopausal republican women reported for being too masculine. This law is so easily abusable that they'll soon realise they're going to have to sift through a thousand non-trans people before they can even find a single trans person
wtf is happening to america
You know America really prides itself on being ""land of the free"" yet every day so many people become less and less free, and I don't think they're actually considering how this is going to affect people in the long run as well

Because this is just beginning, theyre taking rights away from us and others then sooner or later we're going to see them take rights away from so many more, Just because it doesn't affect someone now doesn't mean it's not always going to and that's what these close-minded selfish dumbasses need to start thinking about. If they don't care about us maybe they'll care about themselves when they get their own rights taken
Fucking Texas.
My solution? Blow up call centers about politicians and right wing news anchors wearing makeup and how your son is now asking why men wear makeup. Why are sex offenders trying to indoctrinate my children into their trans culture?! I can‚Äôt even. üò§ 

Texas is a joke of a state. Doesn‚Äôt have a working power grid, kids dying by the dozen from shootings, but clearly the biggest issue is men in makeup. üòë
I am also in TX and dont know what this is about

Do you have a link my friend?!?

EDIT If anyone also in TX wants to message me my inbox is open. Sylvia Rivera kept a list of all the trans folks she knew and their emergency contacts in her bible. that, along with her other activism, inspired me to want to network to other trans folks near me. so my inbox is open  and i would love to hear from you ü©∑
Jeans, pants of any kind, shorts of any kind, t-shirts of any kind, short skirts (ever heard of kilts anyone), hosiery, heels, combat boots, cowboy boots, gladiator sandals, Oxford style shirts, polo shirts, tank tops, cowboy hats, boyshort underwear,"" boyfriend"" style shirts, business suits, aviator glasses, tennis shoes,... the number of cis women they'll need to prosecute for wearing these traditionally masculine and often clearly meant for men clothes. The  number of retail stores being fined for daring to sell these make items on a mass scale to cis women.
Ted Cruz's senate seat is up for a vote in 2024, Start by voting that POS out. Lots of down ballot races too. Take a stand! And if not you're always welcome here in Oregon.
The concern is valid. However SB 12 has only passed the senate. Holding out hope for the House being more sensible.
A similar law was shot down by the courts in Tennessee. Hope you can get the same justice!

This is what eventually caused the Stonewall riots, just to be clear. Here we fucking go again, I guess.

‚ÄúHey Patrick! What am I now?‚Äù
I concur with any suggestion for malicious compliance and weaponization of the law. However, what's missing is basically how to go about that safely. 

First up, be in contact with a law professional. This law WILL backfire so there's probably some legally-inclined allies out there waiting to help use their knowledge and abilities to help it get overturned in courts.

Second, loopholes, loopholes, loopholes. Study up the law like it's the Bible and figure out what you can do that you can't be arrested for. The ambiguity inherent in it will allow you to exist comfortably as you want to, just with a few caveats.

Lastly, break the law. Not by direct illegal resistance to it but by using itself as a weapon against itself. This circle back to my first point of getting in contact with someone who knows legal stuff because you want to do things that would get you in trouble, put you in a courtroom, and force the court to evaluate the legitimacy of the law. You want to coordinate this with a community of people who the law effects (which include basically anyone who works with clothes and makeup) so that no single individual bears the cost of the case and the number of problems with the law become more apparent. 

But above all else, survival while oppressed is better than death while oppressed. Be cautious, focus on your health and well-being, and make enough sacrifices to keep yourself safe. Do not conform totally but don't risk it all just to lose it all in prison unless you plan on writing a book.
What? It's normal for men to have longer hair, and I hope there's a fucking outrage this is a violation of human rights! Aren't the Republicans the ones who love America bc of our ""free country?"" It's not freedom if people are being forced to comply to rules that sound like they came from religious transphobes
I live in one of the states that followed Texas, and managed to pass a law like this. It's super scary and difficult, because I've already socially transitioned and changed my name. At this point, I don't own anything that wouldn't be considered Drag under these bills. I've been transitioning for 3 years, I don't have my old clothes or name or anything anymore, and can't afford to buy a new wardrobe to re-stealth. I haven't been able to afford my hormones either for about a year, so I look obviously trans right now. I'm stuck in a terrible place. Even going to the store is a terrifying ordeal.  


I really wish we didn't have to go through these kinds of things. I wish I could help you, but at least I can say you aren't alone. We'll all get through this together somehow.
>It goes on to define ""drag"" as anyone who dresses or presents in a waythat doesn't ""match"" their biological sex assigned at birth.

This isn't fair. I completely agree that sex, nudity and raunch shouldn't be exposed to kids, but drag queens typically aren't doing that stuff around minors. I've been to the drag queen story hours where I live. Reading Babar books while wearing a dress isn't sexual or offensive.
Do they realize that practically every painting of Jesus he has long flowing hair, and is never seen wearing slacks or a button down shirt? 


Hey Texas, I learned in school about a bunch of men who wore curly wigs, tights, and high heeled shoes: the founding fathers!  (Some of them even spoke French) 


And how about makeup? I'm sure tough guys like Trump or Chuck ""Texas Ranger"" Norris would never wear make up,except every single time they are in front of a camera. 


Anyways, good luck in prison, along with a very large chunk of the rest of the state.
Wait they arrest men with long hair, nails and makeup? Can't wait to see them arrest a Black metal musician
Just move a bit north up here to New Mexico where your rights are protected and the community is absolutely fine with you being here.  We have legal weed, free college, and the most bomb food you'll ever ear.

&#x200B;

We even passed the ""Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Freedom Act"" which codifies our rights.  We even allow people to change their gender on their drivers license without a doctors note.  Even ""x"" if you want to identify as non-binary or gender neutral (That's what's on my license)  


  
This place kicks ass.
Can someone link me the law that passed? Is it SB12 or something else? Thanks in advance
Are you referring to bill [HB4378](https://translegislation.com/bills/2023/TX/HB4378) ?
Leave. Even Mexico is better than this shit.
Nothing says freedom like forcing everyone else to conform to the exact lifestyle you think is best
I‚Äôm having fun imagining effeminate trans men and masculine trans women mess with their brains x)
As people above say once a stupid amount of reports get submitted and people use it against them then it‚Äôll soon stop being enforced.

It‚Äôs the same concept as the book bill that was passed lately, the intent was to stop being able to teach about lgbt and sex under the guise of it being inappropriate for children so people have started to report the bible for the same thing and under their law it‚Äôs entirely reasonable to do so.

They will not have thought this through enough for the consequences that will happen
Sorry for spamming the hell out of your post OP. thank you so much for making it or I wouldnt know this even happened. The disinformation makes it hard to sort fact from fiction. 

Sylvia Rivera was arrested over 200 times for ""upper head female impersonation"" and what did she say? She said ""I REFUSE to pass!"" She compared it to a POC passing as white. 

OP I encourage you to listen to her old interviews... Making Gay History's first ep of their podcast has an interview with her and a lot of other fiesty historical queer folks that will comfort and motivate you. Ive been listening to it and it helps, i promise, to hear people from the 70s or 40s talk about what they went through and hearing the radical shit they were saying/doing then. 

As Chuck Rowland in s1e7 of the podcast, who got fired for being gay and fought it for 15 years until the government sent him a letter apologizing, said... This is how people get radicalized--  they get fucked with! And they see its bullshit, and the light comes on and they fight back

So basically no Scottish bagpipes, no rock concerts, no football (paint on the face), no male news anchors and no actors existing in the state of Texas

They will have to arrest all women wearing jeans and shirts and other male clothing.
fun fact: most state legislatures personal info including: phone numbers, addresses, full names, emails, etc. are available online on either their website or the states government website, i was able to find that the one who introduced this bill (gov. dan patrick)  has a p.o. box which i‚Äôm not saying what it is

We have to get our country back on track and the only way to make positive strides is to vote these conservatives out of office. We need the majority vote in both the house and the the senate.
The land of the free. Equal rights for all.

Except black people, asian people, hispanic people, jewish people, gay people, women, muslims...

Everybody who's not a white man.

No y'know what not even white people. Nobody gets any rights.
You have another realistic option too, and that's move out of the christostan caliphate to an actual free part of the county.  Life has never been better for us in solidly blue states.
I hate it here. I wish I could be taken away from Texas myself
I swear to god this is one of the most flawed fucked up laws in American history. Imma start reporting Republican women for wearing pants, Republican politicians for wearing makeup(how else does trumps face get that orange), maybe be a little malicious and report everyone I see because how would I know what‚Äôs in their pants?

Wtf doesn't the US have more serious problems? Like in general? Oh well divide and conquer right? How can there be a majority for any laws like that, not just within the general population but even within the gop?

Well in for a country that feels comfortable incarcerating 505 ppl per 100000, which actually is a huge improvement if you can believe it by about 190 from 2018, it kinda tracks, I just guess they felt like they were missing a couple of prison slaves in their prison industrial complex to line their pockets.

At this point it seems the only 3 options left would be to either take radical steps to strip them of their power, generalstrike have EVERYONE lay down their work until they step down [maybe just have everyone dienie just republicans any type of service might work] a revolution something like a civil war or removing your self and as many people and money as you can from the economy and move it to a different country maybe even Mexico, that would be fun to see the reaction of politicians when Mexico economy is growing while the US economy is falling into a deep recession 

Internationally how about sanctions? We're more than just one nation. Maybe have all US trans people ask for asylum and force political action of other nations, because of draconian prosecution. If Western nations condem Russia for this type of shit a couple of years ago they should do the same  to the US.
Only word of advice for you: join your local Pink Pistols, Socialist RA, or EFJBC chapter, organize, and be VERY cautious. Don't go quietly into the night.

This could lead to some very terrible things or situations, this is wild but not really totally a surprise considering it's texas.

Same here in Tennessee.  Except here it's only a temporary judicial order keeping it from being currently active.
Get as many people in texas to report as many people as possible, flood the system with false reports, that should piss them off and hopefully anyone ‚Äúguilty‚Äù will slip through unnoticed, then burn the system to the ground (take that as literally as you feel like taking it)
i‚Äôm usually pretty good and understand the ‚Äúother‚Äù person‚Äôs side.  like even if i don‚Äôt agree, i can still understand where they‚Äôre coming from, even if their logic‚Äôs really flawed, but how is dressing as an opposite gender grooming?  what could you possibly be grooming a child for by wearing a dress?  and by grooming, i mean the textbook definition, how tf is it grooming?
Well they define drag pretty clearly I guess. How do they define ""performance""?
We will not comply!

Report everyone for everything. Men with long hair, women with short hair. Men who wear bracelets (you know those ‚Äúmanly‚Äù bracelets?) Women wearing pants. Men with earrings. No one is safe report them ALL.
Some people in the thread are talking about reporting women for wearing men‚Äôs clothing to make a point. Please do not do this. That behavior is going to enforce gender checks for trans mascs and POC in particular will be at much higher risk for assault and death. Any older person will remember the articles laws, these gender check assaults impacted all of us, please do not weaponize the police.
have you ever documented anything about your transition officially? name changes, gender changes, anything like that?
I just want civil war & to divide already, or Die trying.
I'm apolitical, so don't have a strong opinion either way. 

I am curious as to why some people feel so strongly that that drag performers, who present an often sexualised parody of women for adult entertainment, would ever need to interact with children?
[deleted]
The same bill was passed into law here in TN, but it's currently embattled legally.  A judge already put a stay on allowing it to go into effect.
so just having long hair would make me a sex offender even if I have a beard that is crazy.
I‚Äôve always wondered why anyone thinks the US is so free. From the outside it‚Äôs a deeply unattractive place, and steadily getting worse. Stay safe.
Okay I've read over this shit and it seems the bill - if I'm reading it correctly and assuming the word ""and"" in law between two criteria/conditions in a legislative document means that both the terms before AND after are required for it to apply... - says that it performances in the nude generally, or cross dressing in the context of...a performance that ""appeals to the prurient interest in sex"" if people under 18 are around or if it's done in a public space one can reasonably assume a minor could see. Now what that means legally speaking - and thankfully it's not just some new string of words in law - is... well

>material appealing to prurient interest as material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts, and defined prurient interest as a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion 

However, of course, this is subjective to some extent. And all the above is simply defining what counts as a ""sexually oriented performance"". More importantly perhaps is that - again if I'm reading the damned law correctly...it's a law prohibiting owners of commercial venues as well as anyone who might be able to authorize these types of performances. And, even with the vagueness of the legal definition above...it seems that ""Drag queen story hour"" would be a stretch-armstrong type reach to prohibit. Further it doesn't seem to say anything about arresting people. Mostly just fines - for business owners or people able to authorize public performances. 

So, if all parties act in good faith and to the law as written, it literally does not prevent you from presenting fem in public. It just states that if you are presenting fem in public...and acting like...sexual in fairly performative ways or just otherwise inappropriate ways then you might have a problem, or in a place of business be asked to stop/leave. So like...don't play grab ass or anything and it \*shouldn't\* be an issue. ... 

Kind of underwhelming as far as these laws go, tbh. A different state iirc is doing a law where if you're a ""male dressing as a female"" you can't even ""monologue"" in public...whatever the hellish fuck THAT means. 

If any legal buffs wanna correct my interpretation of this shite please do so.

Unfortunately its not just southern states.  I live in a liberal state in the northeast, and my TERF sister in law, who is a self proclaimed ""progressive"", lost her shit when her trans 12 yo kid started talking to me about gender stereotypes and i told them i presented as femme.  Lost. Her. God. Damn. Mind. Literally the conversation involved clothes and nail polish. I would never have guessed in a million years she was so transphobic. But I might as well have been being yelled at by Ron DeSantis.

Point being, unfortunately, while its a minority in most places, many people we would think would be our allies, still hold this sick transphobic bigoted view.
You know cops would turn a blind eye to that cause Jesus
How about female cops wearing pants?  That doesn't sound like it conforms with traditional women's clothing.
Yes report all of the women wearing jeans. Or just anything other than a dress. Then report the men for wearing shorts saying they look effeminate.
Yes. This. Totally this.

Just like someone in Utah turned that state's book-banning law on it's head to demand the Bible be removed from a school
Report any of them that have short hair. Report them for wearing pant suits. Report them for not wearing heels, makeup, jewelry etc. Hell, you could get really petty and report ones with broad shoulders and square jawlines. Menopause can also cause facial hair to grow, report that. Literally anything to abuse this barbaric law.
Okay, yeah, all that, but like. They KNOW these laws will be challenged. That's the goal. They want it to get to higher and higher courts to:

1. Waste time and


2. Give the generally conservative-filled courts a chance to support them officially.
It is the fascist takeover after all the political infrastructure was put in to ban abortion.

Conservatives got involved in their primaries. Conservatives worked locally in the political machinery. Conservatives gerrymandered districts to guarantee wins in conservative states. The most reliably conservative judges were put in at all levels. The Supreme Court was even taken.

The zero-middle ground polices of anti-abortion activists and religious groups built the infrastructure and led to this.

Anything diassproved of by conservative churches will be torn down.
Look up Seven-Mountain Dominionism. It is, unfortunately, not as crazy as it sounds. It‚Äôs basically the root of all the anti-abortion, anti-LGBT+, etc. legislative nonsense
Short hand notes‚Ä¶ government people (state and federal) are upset at a minority and want to make it impossible to live as said minority or just straight genocide said minority because it‚Äôs getting too hard to control and loud to ignore anymore. Some people think it goes against their ‚Äúreligious beliefs‚Äù to understand people who are different from them and use their ‚Äúfaith‚Äù as a shield to deflect all criticism or wrong doing. Should mention government and religion should be separate entities but they in reality mix way too often in the political affairs of the USA.

There's a problem regarding the little green pieces of paper with dead guys on them. I don't have enough.
This is what they are actually trying to do - get a super majority of legislatures in 35 states to be red by making anyone that could potentially be blue or moderate move to the other states... at that point, they control the entire US because 35 states let's them rewrite the constitution to be whatever they want.
I think we need to start looking into non profits in our states to help our family in other states at this point, much like the Aunty network does for women seeking abortions.

This way, of course most people fall for it, because of course you don't want sexually explicit drag queens dancing in front of kids. The 2ns thing it accomplishes is that it enables any transphobic or homophobic police officer, store manager or even just a regular person, to say they see it as a performance, they see it as drag, etc. And you can catch a lot more people in the net. That's not something that's possible to happen with more specific wording. Go back and look at all the bills republicans have made in recent years. They're ALL worded this way. It's on purpose.
Patriarchal valuation of masculinity and devaluation of femininity.

It‚Äôs the same reason why the culture warriors obsess over (especially feminine) gay men more than lesbian women.
Not legally no. But I am in the process currently of getting my name and gender marker changed. Surprisingly easy in this state, it just takes a while for the process. Equally surprising is that Texas is not one of the states in which you have to have had srs in order to change your gender marker. All you need is a court order, which judges in Austin will all too readily and happily give, which is why they are so backlogged, and all you need for that is a letter from a physician. There is no law that says judges have to honor the letter and getting one doesn't guarantee your petition will be accepted, but I've heard of exactly zero cases of anyone getting denied out of Austin, which is why everyone goes there. I'm trying to hurry up and get that done before that changes too.
You don‚Äôt have a ‚Äústrong opinion‚Äù on whether any random ‚Äúfree‚Äù citizen of a ‚Äúfree country‚Äù should be abused & arrested for, literally, just existing in society, while wearing ‚Äúany 3‚Äù  of; clothing, shoes, accessories, makeup, hair &/or nails, that some power-tripping, stick-up-their-‚Äú***‚Äù puritanical authoritarian ‚Äúmoralist‚Äù arbitrarily decided, does not ‚Äúmatch their AGAB‚Äù?

So, I guess that means you don‚Äôt care about equality, freedom, & human rights? Or, at least, not enough to ‚Äúhave a strong opinion‚Äù‚Ä¶?
It's Senate bill 12.
Everything I've read said it passed 20-11 but hasn't taken effect yet.
Constantly deconstructing these bill‚Äôs tripwire spiderweb, Machiavellian legal language, is exhausting, and decidedly bad for my mental health. So, I‚Äôm just going to leave a few quick points for your consideration, regarding how this ‚Äúlaw‚Äù could be used.

First, understand that those pushing these bills, see any ‚Äúdeviance‚Äù from, what THEY CONSIDER to be, normalized cis-het gender presentation, as based purely in ego & sexuality, & therefore serving NO OTHER PURPOSE than ‚Äúappealing to the prurient interest in sex‚Äù, to the presenting individual, & to any other person who happens to see them.

Further, seeing as how they deny that being transgender is a real thing, & that being ‚Äútrans‚Äù is not a ‚Äúlegitimate ontological state of being‚Äù. They view ANYTHING, other than ‚ÄúAGAB appropriate presentation‚Äù, PURELY as ‚Äúa PERFORMANCE‚Äù. This includes, but is not limited to, walking down the street, engaging in casual conversation, friendly waving to another person‚Ä¶ you know what? Just put LITERALLY ANYTHING here, & it would apply.

Honestly, that‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôm going to stop there.

I hope it helps view the language of this bill in a more illuminated light.
I would rather not see this country descend into civil war over this dumb culture war bullshit. Civil war means our families and friends are now on the menu. No thanks. I‚Äôd rather see an amicable split. I grew up in Vicksburg, MS. The losing side never really recovers. Ask me how I know‚Ä¶
Also, report cis women for wearing women‚Äôs clothes. They will need to prove they don‚Äôt have dicks.

This will not end well for fascists.
It's been said before, it will be said again. Malicious compliance is the greatest tool of a civil activist
Yea but they act likenthwyre straight outta the 60's
I‚Äôm an Aussie but from what OP‚Äôs said about this law it totally could apply.
It's 2023 we shouldn't have to defend what we wear

And you're delusional to think they won't go that far
And Tennessee. And it‚Äôs in the works for Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska (but that one is being filibustered into oblivion), Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia. 
*sigh*
Yup, plus who do they think they are parading around as a police officer? That's a MAN'S job. /s
No kidding. It's like the republicans haven't seen 80's metal bands before.
Probably only do this if you're positive they're an evil neocon demon. Don't want innocent people who live in these states and don't even support these laws to be hurt just because they're cis and typecast as a boomer Fox News enjoyer.
I'm worried this could backfire.

They might actually make all women wear dresses
Not just jeans, sneakers/trainers too...no more skate shoes, no more running shoes, no more B-Ball shoes

It's high heels and dressy flats from now on.

Malicious Compliance, comrades!
Could I have more info on that ?
Not if we tear them down first.
> Conservatives gerrymandered districts to guarantee wins in conservative and non-conservative states.

FTFY. If you look at Wisconsin, looking at the results from recent state wide ballots, they should have close to 50/50 R and D representation in the legislature, but they don't. Their electoral map is so heavily gerrymandered to weaken Democratic voices and strengthen GOP to where the Republicans have a supermajority in both the house and senate.
Wanting to bring about the end times and make the US a theocracy isn‚Äôt the sanest notion in my book, but yes, they have been at it for a long time.

The Dominionists aren‚Äôt the only ones involved though. Alliance Defending Freedom, Heritage Foundation, Family Policy Alliance, Focus on the Family, and American College of Pediatrics (not the AAP) have backers from multiple demographics, not just Dominionists. Gotta love the BS in those names though.
Exactly, as time goes on they're just going to keep taking more and more of peoples rights so just because it doesn't affect some people now doesn't mean it won't down the line

People think it's bad now but sooner or later it's going to get a lot worse if this carries on, I mean seriously what's next? Are they going to start not allowing women to work again or maybe they'll start separating places by color again. Because there is literally no end goal here besides people getting more and more power to just take away rights that everyone should have over their own life
Right?! No no no. Men in makeup who perform things I ENJOY are okay. What you enjoy is clearly evil!
That's facepaint, just like GI Joe isn't a Doll, he is an Action Figure
OMG I meant call obsessively in high volume to drive them insane! üòÖ how‚Äôd I forget this is America?
This has not been passed into law yet!!!
Grew up in Portland and moved to Texas, now sadly in Missouri and my spouse is trans and was just getting brave enough to transition and now‚Ä¶all of this! Enjoy Oregon, visit the falls in Corbett and Ashland! Good luck and we will probably be right behind you :)
$10 civil penalty similar to any other civil infraction such as parking tickets.
‚ÄúNo! I‚Äôm Texas!‚Äù
I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm originally from Texas but I moved out last year. I hope you stay safe babe üíñü´Çü´Ç
Thats fair! I mean same, but im inspired by how radical Sylvia was and how she believed we had the right to be openly queer. I think what she was saying was we shouldn't have to pass to be safe, and at the time ""pass"" meant passing as cishet and assimilate into white cishet society. I mean Sylvia also says ""if you walked down 42nd street and even LOOKED like a f-ggot you were getting arrested."" The point I think she wanted the hate to STOP, not find ways to navigate it and just survive it. She wanted change. She wanted liberation!!!!! Theres an underground documentary about Sylvia on youtube I recommend called ""More than Stonewall"". If you havent listened to the full interview that quote is from I encourage you to!

Edit i see this is getting downvoted. Why downvote our own history? Like yes I want to pass to avoid violence but it doesnt end there, I dont want to quietly pass and leave everything as it is just so the violence hits the nonpassing folks. I want the violence gone. Why downvote that? Very curious if anyone wants to lmk
just learn 2 code, duh
To those downvoted me... I was being sarcastic....
You don‚Äôt need tens of thousands of dollars to move, and you can take as long as you need to squirrel away bits of cash here and there. Advising somebody to move doesn‚Äôt come with the expectation it can be done immediately and effortlessly. 

I moved cross country for unrelated reasons in 2011. It took a little over a year and a half of scrounging whatever I could from the $8/hour I earned at the time until I had enough to survive a few months without work. It was hard, it was a grueling wait, but it was worth it and I‚Äôd do it again without hesitation.
I fear since this witchhunt started, that this is the real reason behind those bills.
This! The solution is to take back liberal majorities or at least get rid of supermajorities in Red States, not to run and let the bigots win. We need to keep up emigration from places like New York and California to progressive cities in the Deep South like Atlanta, Austin, and New Orleans. At the same time, blue states need to make themselves as unattractive as possible to the right wing by implementing progressive policies.
So which four of the current 19 solidly blue state legislatures do you think they're going to try to switch by forcing Democrats out?

Virginia is the only one I could possibly see flipping anytime soon.
Anyone who sings, lipsyncs, dances, or otherwise ""performs"" in front of an audience. A performance could be something as simple as ""crossdressing"" as an actor in costume. 

Please refer to my other post much longer on this thread going over the law itself. The criteria is not JUST that. Now unless the law doesn't view the word ""And"" between two sections when describing what constitutes the offence itself as binding them together and requiring both to be true. 

This one seems to not be worded the way some other more psychotic bills are worded, strangely enough. Did you read through it and check the definitions and all that jazz?

Furthermore it seems to be targetted towards owners of establishments as well as any person who can authorize a public performance - I assume that to mean someone who's job it is to schedule events like that or give the go-aheads. It doesn't seem to specify anything about the PERFORMER being charged with breach of this law - unless they're also the owner of the establishment I suppose.
Then I strongly recommend you leave the state as soon as you feasibly can. Texas is trying to make lists of trans people with records of name and gender changes; it‚Äôs possible the list has already compiled and they‚Äôre pretending it needed tweaking.

https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ken-paxton-list-trans-texans-1234647489/amp/
Ok wow thank you so much
So what does this mean. As a trans man on T, if i was in drag would that be considered legal? But me being masculine and wearing masc clothes would be illegal?
That still doesn't change the fact that the bill isn't targeting individuals on the street, nor even performers themselves, but people who own venues who allow it on their venue, as well as like...public workers who authorize performances in public spaces. 

Not in this bill, at least. 

This does not seem to allow one to be arrested for being trans or even cross dressing.
I don‚Äôt know shit bout the us but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that shit happens
Report cis men for wearing men's clothes. Claim that they are really women who are just trying to make men look bad.
Report any female officers who respond for wearing pants.
transphobic republicans are unironically already doing this tho. in some ways i think this was kind of their goal. i remember hearing about a case in a literal elementary school where they wanted to check all of the little girls to make sure they didn't have dicks. its absolutely insane they can talk about wanting to do this and people support it and don't see the obvious pedophilia but are so brainwashed that they think trans people just existing is pedophilia. its absolutely insane. but i dont think we should be doing what the transphobes have been doing. maybe im wrong, thats just my opinion. idk i guess my point is that transphobes have already called me and other allies the t slur ""because of my jawline"" (in other words because im an ally. im a cis woman btw) and i just dont really see why we would join sides with them in that? i dont know, if someone could explain this to me that would be greatly appreciated, im just trying to understand!
exactly. lots of 100% passing trans people, you want that bulked up dude with a beard and biceps the size of a watermelon, wearing skirts and using the same bathroom as ""our innocent children""? like okay, im transmasc. im not allowed to use the mens room because im biologicalpy female, but (hypothetically) if i was on HRT for 5 years, top surgery, full male presentation... theyd still want me in the womens room?

i think they only hate ""non passing"" trans people because it has nothing to do w being trans because guess what, you cant always tell üò≠
Still can't argue that to a judge in 2023.
No judge is going to interpret women wearing pants as women in drag
Tennessee got theirs struck down by the courts
Edit: sorry not struck down but blocked. We shall see how long the block will last.
The Secession States.
The West Virginia bill died in committee and the session is adjourned sine die.
Damn right! Haha
The malicious compliance venom in that was golden‚Ä¶we probably could take it a step further and start saying Y job before sufferage is considered a ‚ÄúMANS‚Äù job so no women should be allowed to be x job title. Asumming the law is that ambiguous. Probably not but it would get a good point across if the law is that broad and grasping at straws. I hope we don‚Äôt have to do that to make a point but if we must we must.
Which is ironic considering so many have used We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister as a campaign song (or whatever it's called) and yet... have any of them actually looked at Twisted Sister?
You're probably not wrong. They did just make it so women in the  Missouri house can't show their shoulders. I'm sure the Christian right wing would gladly make every woman wear a burka
Eeeep. The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale.
Actually, high heels were [originally and more commonly seen on men in cavalry positions](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-high-life-a-history-of-men-in-heels/iQJCgMgwSKV5Kw) \- by traditional conventions, all male soldiers should be wearing high heels. See how the transphobes reckon with that one.
Sure...

Strangely, while they have managed to influence backers from outside of the traditional dominionist fold, all of those organizations were founded on 7M values and by 7M members. Just because they don‚Äôt currently claim direct dominionist end goals, that doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt dominionist organizations. They‚Äôre all pushing for those seven mountains. Whether the members realize it or not, that‚Äôs what their leadership is reaching for.
well there are conservatives talking about taking away womens right to vote....
If they‚Äôre allowed to continue unchecked, gay rights and marriage are absolutely next.
Yep still needs to pass house and govenor, but yaknow abbot so just the house really
My wife used to live there and we‚Äôve traveled there many times.
Oh gotcha
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference?‚Äù ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I get frustrated when people say ""just move!"" as if anyone can do it if they work hard enough. You ever considered that maybe the person has family they support? Old/sick relatives, a kid that can't move away from their other parent? Maybe they're sick themselves and can't lose their medical support? They have too much debt to save any spare money? They're underwater on their mortgage and the house won't sell? They work in an industry that can't be relocated? All their spare change goes to supporting someone else who'd be homeless without them? Being in the state they're in literally prevents them from saving money due to the financial hardships created by that state's laws? They can't work because they're disabled?

""Just move, you can do it if you save enough!"" Is ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" rhetoric. I'm glad moving worked for you. It worked for me too. Doesn't work for everyone.
There were some republican state politicians late last year that actually said the goal was to drive all the liberals to blue states so they get a super majority in 35 states.  I can't remember who it was, but there were videos circulating for a few weeks about it.
Austin has tried to fight the state numerous times. Abbot, Paxton, and Patrick have smacked them down multiple times. HISD has been taken over. AISD is next on the retribution list.

Austin will lose. The local liberal tech companies don‚Äôt have the stomach to fight. They have shareholders to answer to and shareholders don‚Äôt give a damn about a few trans people getting their lives ruined.

Ok, l guess I‚Äôm doing this, after all. Let‚Äôs go, then‚Ä¶

*I have taken the liberty of adding quotations & parentheses for personal comments, & to aid understanding, & edited out excess legal jargon, not relevant to the point, for ease of digestion.

(From) [Section 1](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB12/id/2771604)

(applies to) Performances on; 

PUBLIC PROPERTY, 
(anywhere that is not private property)

on the premises of a commercial enterprise, 
(any business holding whatsoever)

or, in the presence of a child 
(literally anywhere).

So, as to where this can be applied‚Ä¶ well, you tell me. Can you think of ANY PLACE where these conditions would fail to be met? (Other than specifically licensed establishments for ‚Äúadult entertainment‚Äù). It‚Äôs literally ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù a person could possibly find themselves.

(From) Section 3.

A ‚Äúsexually oriented performance‚Äù means a visual performance that features:

A.(ii) a male performer exhibiting as a female, or a female performer exhibiting as a male, who uses clothing, makeup, or other similar physical markers and who ‚Äúperforms‚Äù before an ‚Äúaudience‚Äù (2 or more people); or

(B)  appeals to the ‚Äúprurient interest‚Äù in sex.
(Examples of ‚ÄúPrurient Interest‚Äù, taken from [LawInsider.com](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/prurient-interest): 1. ""Prurient interest is an appeal to an unhealthy, abnormal, unwholesome, degrading, shameful, or morbid interest in sex."" Id. at 117. 2. Prurient interest could be said to be the lowest common denominator, the assumption being that the material is bound to be sexually arousing to at least someone.)

(b)  A person commits an offense if, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER COMPENSATION for the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù IS EXPECTED OR RECEIVED, the person engages in a ‚Äúsexually oriented performance‚Äù:

Please take particular note of the language, ‚ÄúA *PERSON* commits an offence if‚Ä¶ *THE PERSON* engages in a‚Ä¶ performance‚Äù

This is regarding the ‚Äúperformer‚Äù, being charged with an offence, NOT a business, or property owner. 

Also, PUBLIC PROPERTY is stipulated as an area of effect. Who owns public property? Who are they going to bring an offence against? Themselves, the government? No, of course not. The offence is given to THE INDIVIDUAL ‚ÄúPERFORMER‚Äù. This legislation makes it possible to EXTEND the responsibility, for the offence, to property owners, allowing them to be charged/fined/sentenced, AS WELL AS any individual ‚Äúperformers‚Äù.

The primary offence is on the ‚Äúperformer‚Äù, themselves.

If not specifically codified in this particular bill, believe that other presiding bills have already laid out the legal consequences for the person considered to be the ‚Äúperformer‚Äù. I do not have all the specifics off the top of my head, and I don‚Äôt have the time to take this explanation further. You will find it, if you look for it. Being able to charge the property owner for an illegal performance, is not possible without the performance having been already made illegal, & consequences & proceedings for the initiating individual already being in existence.

So, combine this information, with my initial response, & begin to see how dangerous & discriminatory this law would be‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hopefully‚Ä¶?
me neither and I‚Äôm gearing up to be able to flee if it happens
We‚Äôre mostly just venting and showing the illogic of the bill. The idea is to overwhelm the system with reports against conservative people they have to abandon the law. But I‚Äôm reality we know they‚Äôll just ignore these and only prosecute people they know are trans, no matter how many false reports we flood them with.
Yeah it seems like these laws are focused on the vulnerable trans folks still In awkward phases of transition. The right is clueless about how many of us will look like cross-dressers if we dress according who our AGAB.
They're trying to ban men from wearing traditionally women's clothing

With that logic, women wearing traditionally men's othibg should also get in trouble

It's just to maliciously comply with them
No doubt. But a shittonne of reports, considered legitimate according to the vaguely worded law, could potentially get it repealed. It‚Äôs been done before.
Most likely long enough that it will be struck down.
What does sine die mean?
Their predecessors from the 80s (and maybe themselves if old enough) were diametrically opposed to using this song or anything else vaguely metal because of the Satanic Panic. And men in 80s metal bands were often made fun of for being ""femme"" or suspected of being gay or just sexual deviants.  The language that we have today to describe gender variance pretty much didn't exist, but take a look at bands like Poison and other glam metal bands (including TS, actually).  These are all cis men who didn't  cross dress outside of performances or videos,  but that slight amount of gender bending style was enough to implode the brains of most of the conservatives back then.  

Tl;Dr I can't fucking believe any of them are using that song for their campaigns.  Dee Snider and whoever else is left of Twisted Sister should sue the fuck out of them.  Ridiculous fucking people. 

Edit: i guess the whole thing where he said to stop playing that song already happened.
Nah because they are so racist that they wouldn't want their wives looking like ""terrorists""
And show them the portrait of Louis XIV (14th) in his red-soled high heels!

I believe it was the Persians(?) who either pioneered the use or at least popularised them for cavalry use, I could be wrong.
Thanks :)
I didn‚Äôt know about that law
Oh yeah I really wouldn't be surprised if they start passing laws that don't allow women to work especially considering all of the laws they've been trying to pass banning abortions and allowing forced pregnancies during literally any circumstance and any age
Seriously? I can't say I'm surprised but fucking hell. Do you have a source or anywhere I can read more about this?
I need a source to show my family.
100% agree with you, they are not going to stop if this continues
It will almost certainly pass. There is no doubt in my mind üòû
i understand that. I'll be fighting with you guys until the end tho. stay strong. i know its hard. but they want us dead and we should stay alive even if solely to spite them
absolutely. they dont understand the nuances and facts of it. they know the caricature of a trans person that these right wingers have made up and then decided to blame for everything, subsequently catching real trans people in the crossfire. no we have to deal with the repercussions of some fake radical groomer trans person that they made up who doesn't even exist
I get what this is about but no judge is going to consider pants for women to be traditional mens clothing in 2023.
‚ÄúWithout a day‚Äù

It means the session is over for good.
No, you're right, it was first the Persians as far as I know.

My first time seeing a man in heels was with the Swedish band ABBA. ABBA is awesome.
In theory suits should still work. That's only a past-decade sort of thing for the most part. Sure it's been worn before that and it's gained popularity since, but by no means is it traditional
You're missing the broader picture and thus the point. It's not about actually having a judge decide on these, it's about flooding the system with reports to drown out any actual reports submitted by transphobes. They won't have the resources to investigate every single one, at least not in a timely manner.
By their logic they have too but idk

I'm not American so woo
They are.

first man in heels for me was Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in ""Some Like it Hot"""	12hw16y	trans	1687	0.98	2023-04-10 20:59:15
The governor of Utah‚Äôs response to a ban on transgender people in Utah sports is encouraging and positive	"It‚Äôs not perfect, but a lot of it obviously comes from a place of kindness. He vetoed a bill banning transgender kids from competing in women‚Äôs sports when, at the last minute, the commission overhauled the bill that originally proposed inclusion after review. A bill that was built with the LGBTQ community where everyone found a compromise together and agreed to tweak the system continuously instead became a blanket ban at the 11th hour. The pull quote below is exactly the kind of thing I wish more people would realize, and it‚Äôs coming from the republican governor of a red state. Maybe there is hope for the trans community. I encourage everyone to read the whole statement. There is some transphobic language, but it seems to come more from a place of ignorance, not hatred.

https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/03/22/gov-spencer-coxs/

‚ÄúFour kids and only one of them playing girls sports. That‚Äôs what all of this is about. Four kids who aren‚Äôt dominating or winning trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who are just trying to find some friends and feel like they are a part of something. Four kids trying to get through each day. Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few. I don‚Äôt understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live. And all the research shows that even a little acceptance and connection can reduce suicidality significantly. For that reason, as much as any other, I have taken this action in the hope that we can continue to work together and find a better way. If a veto override occurs, I hope we can work to find ways to show these four kids that we love them and they have a place in our state.‚Äù"	"Wow. Just read the whole thing and I have a couple of thoughts on this. 

1) It initially sounded like ""don't pass this because people will sue and we don't have the money to deal with that."" Just goes to show how short sighted their transphobia makes these legislators.

2) Towards the end of his statement, he does seem super sincere and as if he had given some thought into this decision that comes, as OP mentioned, a place of kindness. The excerpt you chose really captures that well, OP.

I guess one last thought, or hope rather, is that more of our political leaders, and equally as important, their constituents, can learn from this man and put as much thought (not that it takes all that much, let's be honest) as he has.
It‚Äôs encouraging for sure.  I hope other republicans take a fucking moment and consider what the fuck they are doing.  But I‚Äôm not very hopeful.
Sadly, I just heard that the veto was just over-ridden :(
I'm proud of him for taking a stand against his party and being compassionate, but unfortunately the party still outnumbers him and they're still going ahead with the ban, fuck America right now.
As someone who lived in Utah for a while, I think this message is more important than whether or not the law goes through. The law will probably go through, but I think everybody anticipated that. What people did not anticipate is a republican governor in a conservative state standing up for the rights of trans youth, and I think for a lot of kids who have grown up in an area where if you assume people want you dead you'll be right most of the time, seeing a prominent leader take a stand for you will mean a lot.
Yes, it's good that one Republican did the right thing. But then they decided to override his veto. So yeah.

I can't get that excited about one guy being decent, I guess, because he really is just doing the minimum in terms of being an ally.
You can tell that he doesn't really understand us, but he genuinely seems to want what's best for us. This honestly made my day
[deleted]
I'm impressed. There's a shadow theocracy in Utah, I almost can't believe this
This is America where people at least pretend to care about fairness. Everyone deserves a place at the table, it can just take some time to slide around the seating chart for a new friend.
The end of his statement got to me. It shouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see empathy like that but it was
This was just for show.  Maybe he's looking at a presidential bid.  

Whatever his real intentions, I don't know how any of you can trust a Utah Republican even a little.  You **can not** get to be the Republican governor of Utah with a clean conscience.

Look at loads and loads of our history.  These bastards only extend olive branches just to use our own compassion against us.  If you don't know your history, and know it from queer/black/indigenous sources, then just trust me this motherfucker is up to no good, but also, get read.
[removed]
I read through these threads and always see y‚Äôall bitching about transphobia. It‚Äôs not transphobia. There are many actions taken towards you folk that is hateful and menacing and horrible, but this isn‚Äôt one. Trans women are shattering women‚Äôs records across sports because they grew up in male bodies and come into the space with massive competitive advantages. It‚Äôs not fair. I support your right to be who you are and live your life free from hate but physical competition is an area where I disagree on inclusion
Cox‚Äôs statement doesn‚Äôt surprise me.  He‚Äôs done it before.  At a 2016 vigil for the victims of the Orlando nightclub massacre, he made an equally incisive statement.  

Cox is far from perfect.  But unlike almost every other conservative politician at the state or national level, he‚Äôs a decent human being.  Sadly, he‚Äôs probably 10-20 years before his time.  

The crusade against us will continue for the foreseeable future.  The Republicans want to exterminate us, and have shown they will do whatever it takes to make it happen.  

But what many in our community don‚Äôt realize is this crusade is a last-gasp effort to maintain the patriarchal Christian white-male status quo.  To be sure, it'll be rough going.  But they‚Äôre too late.  Their crusade is bound to fail.  We‚Äôre too big and too powerful.  Younger generations are far more accepting as a whole.  We‚Äôll eventually see more politicians like Cox, even if they‚Äôre Republican.  Things will get better.
""Because there are logical and passionate arguments by many parties...""

Oh, have there been? /s
... Yeah I don't like this, one bit. I respect he's a politician but I just flat out disagree with some of what he says, especially talking about how this issue turns ""allies into opponents"". 

Yes, it does turn allies into your opponents, because the allies believe in fairness. He also talked about Lia Thomas and... as usual, a republican completely neglects the context as to why she performed so well, citing it as an ""egregious example"". I agree with his points on finance since that's seemingly the only thing republicans start conversations with, but I dislike how it's the forefront of his discussion. 

I'm just saying, if they really want to ban trans people from sports divisions that align with their identity, they should make Transmasc's play in the womens leagues too. I'd love to see the hilarity that ensues from that as long as the Transmasc's consent to playing in womens leagues at least to make a point.
Despite not being conservative, as a Utahn, Cox is not bad at all. Plenty of democrats in Utah actually registered as Republicans to vote for him in the primaries, as this being Utah we always swing red, but he was one of the best candidates they put forward, and actually seems to care about this state and the people in it, regardless of race, sex, gender, religion, or sexuality. If the democrats don‚Äôt put any good candidates forward this next election I‚Äôll probobaly be voting for him tbh.
Human decency. What a rare sight to behold in this day and age.
I live in Utah, and this gives me at least a little bit of hope. I just want to be myself and be happy. Maybe someday, things will turn out ok, I really hope they will. I just wish everyone could be accepting towards me, especially my family. Who knows, maybe they‚Äôll come around. this give me hope that they might.
As a Utahn I‚Äôm proud to have this wonderful man to be our governor, he is the only governor I‚Äôve only heard good things about, h gives me so much hope
I live in texas and I‚Äôm VERY envious of a leader who seems to give a shit about their constituents. And, sadly, a budgetary problem probably resonates more with other legislators than a human rights issue.
The governor is providing multiple reasons why it is a bad bill. It starts with the most simple and logical reason and ends with a powerful appeal to emotion because emotion is what m drives behavior change. It's a very common and powerful rhetorical device used to sway opinion.

The end result is the reader or listener comes away from the speech with the logical reasons cemented into the argument by the emotional bond created by the ending. So the reader or listener is now on the side of the speaker emotionally and morally.
I lived in Utah for 13 years, and while the legislature is bought and paid for by the church there have been some suprisingly open governors.  Huntsman, and Cox were both better than expected.  I do feel like he has to hit point #1 you mentioned because he (and all of us know) that the only thing that might move the Utah state legislature is not humanity, but $$.  To me it shows both that he is a good person, and that he understands where the only levers he really can pull to effect any change exist.
He doesn't sound like he will support trans people BUT cares about life and with a pro life stance that he has he equate the sacrificing his beliefs for the greater good if preventing suicide with trans people using straight logic of trans people are a minority and wouldn't change much
They don't care what they're doing. They just know the voters that vote for them want it and hate trans people

Politicians will do any say literally anything to get/stay in office
For most the cruelty is the point. They‚Äôre desperate to have an under class they can absolutely shit on.
[removed]
Of course it was‚Ä¶
They‚Äôre trying to gather votes they haven‚Äôt yet edit: nope, they did it like last night, fuck.
This is the kind of politician that makes primaries SO important. The dream is to have a liberal governor, but many places that‚Äôs highly unlikely. If you know you‚Äôre in a red state that will very likely vote in a republican, we want more people like this rather than Abbott or his ilk.
I‚Äôm grateful he at least tried. I live in Utah, and it‚Äôs at least a little bit comforting that there are some who are accepting of me. I‚Äôve lived here all my life, there are a lot of good people here. I‚Äôd say the majority of the hate is fueled by ignorance, A lot of people here live in their own sheltered bubble, I did too for the longest time. I feel extremely lucky that I‚Äôve found a support system, even if my family isn‚Äôt the most supportive. Maybe someday things will be better, I really hope so.
My thoughts exactly.
Exactly. I‚Äôve lived in Utah my whole life. Between all the disgusted looks and hurtful jokes,  this is a nice change.
It felt like more than the minimum, especially releasing a statement like this. As political statements go, this one is pretty solidly pro trans kids. But I‚Äôm in texas, so maybe I‚Äôm just pining for some compassion here.
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs being an ally at all. He‚Äôs not supporting the community. All he did was point out that trans people are human and deserve to be treated with dignity. It feels very much the same as ‚Äúhate the sin, love the sinner‚Äù.
And he seems to defer to people who DO know and seems to have tried to educate himself.
That‚Äôs pretty awesome. A politician keeping their word. *sigh*
Agility dogs should compete against cis men. 

Horses should compete against cis men. 

F1 cars should compete against cis men.
To paraphrase a great author, if you think trans women are women except when it comes to sports, you don't really think trans women are women. You just allow them to be women some of the time.
Across sports? The effect of trans athletes on sports and performance records is statistically insignificant.
>  Trans women are shattering women‚Äôs records across sports because they grew up in male bodies and come into the space with massive competitive advantages. 

This is just not true. There's a handful of subcategories where trans women have a small advantage over cis women, and they don't compete enough (and likely never will) to ""shatter records across sports."" Trans women occasionally win, but that's reasonable to expect across 1000s of competitions. You are couching your transphobia in logic but it's clear you have no actual understanding of the science or statistics, you're just being transphobic. 

> It‚Äôs not fair.

This is the weirdest take because sport already is dominated by people with the right genetics and upbringing. Competitive sports is never fair, but you're targeting trans women because you are transphobic rather than finding much more significant ways to make sports fair. 

If you care about fair women's sports so much, increasing funding for research and marketing is a way better way to make it fair than banning trans women. You're not making sports fairer by banning trans kids from playing sports with their peers. Which is what this bill does.

Educate yourself: https://youtu.be/HdT1PvJDRo4
I would pay. I would buy memberships. I would print pink and blue foam (middle) fingers. I would support my trans bros while they just flex on the cis.
It shouldn‚Äôt be a ban as much as just common sense
>the voters that vote for them want it and hate trans people

...which is in turn mainly true because the politicians and their pundit pals have *told* them to hate trans people so the politicians can always score an easy win when their numbers are down.
Fuck off. We are not mentally ill, and we sure as Hell don‚Äôt need or deserve to be thrown in prison or *ENSLAVED* (and yes, that is exactly what you just advocated for) just because we‚Äôre trans.
It is well known among democrats in Utah that they need to be registered as republicans.  The republican primaries are closed in Utah, but the democratic primaries are not.  All of my friends that are democrats in Utah are registered republican so that they can push more liberal republicans through the primaries.
True, in my experience it's pretty rare to even meet another trans person IRL (I'm in Australia though) and I guess it's easy for transphobia to spread when there's more people who have opinions on trans people than people who actually know trans people personally. Sorry your state is treating you like shit.
Not only that, this was the second time he vetoed this bill.
Yeah, I don't see how anyone can be anti-kids and hold a position of power. But that's just me. He didn't say he supports trans kids' right to take blockers to delay puberty or anything like that. He said he doesn't want them to kill themselves. So... Yeah.
Intersex and hermaphroditic athletes present interesting edge cases. It is not all b&w.
So because it‚Äôs insignificant, in your mind that means all the girls and women who are currently losing to trans men don‚Äôt matter. Gotcha. Like always it‚Äôs always about men.. nothing truly changes.
You want to defend womens sports from a fake threat? Sure, but by definition these bulky hot men need to now play against cis women, because after all, ‚Äúit‚Äôs how you were born‚Äù that‚Äôs the most important, not years of hormone treatment or sex reassignment surgery when deeming who can and can‚Äôt play.

I‚Äôd pay real money to watch this too
Who are you guys voting for? Becky Edwards is the popular choice right? At least, that's the vibe that I get. If Mike lee wins the primaries, the next favorite would be McMullin in the generals, right? (I have no one irl rn to ask these questions) I really hope we can unseat mike lee
You literally don't even understand what trans men means.

How did you get to this sub? Did you intentionally come here to be transphobic?

I'm not out to my grandparents, but I told them that Novel is my nickname, and they're very good about calling me it just because they think it's cool and fun. I guarantee that if they knew why I call myself this, they'd do nothing but deadname me.
Same thing happened here. Got into a fight with my brother once, he started calling me the feminine version of my name.. And saying since I look like a girl he should call me one. I can‚Äôt wait till I‚Äôm out. That was surprisingly affirming. But he‚Äôs a raging transphobic a-hole so

Hopefully it just sticks as his ""nickname"" for you. I started calling my sister, Jenn, Jan in 1995 when the Brady Bunch movie came out and it's still her nickname now lol. My youngest, 9, only just found out her Aunt Jan is actually her Aunt Jenn. ü§£ü§£ü§£

We‚Äôre not enemies	"So I‚Äôll cut right to the chase: I‚Äôve seen a lot of trans men saying trans women are dominating trans spaces, I‚Äôve seen a lot of trans women saying trans men are being terf-y and misogynistic and trying to quiet them, and a lot of non-binary people don‚Äôt seem to be part of the conversation at all. This debate has gotten rather heated in places.

We. Are. Not. Enemies.

Yes, absolutely call out hurtful/toxic behavior when you see it, and absolutely talk about the experiences you‚Äôve had, but please don‚Äôt wage war or whatever it is that‚Äôs going on. These are important conversations to have if we‚Äôre to keep everyone feeling safe and included. But please keep it civil and understanding. Assume that the ‚Äúother side‚Äù is your friend until proven otherwise, not the other way around. 

Most trans women aren‚Äôt trying to erase trans men. Most trans men are not trying to silence trans women. Yes, there are bad apples. But that‚Äôs not everyone- in fact I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs not most. What we want, all of us, is just to be able talk about our experiences and relate to people- not to hurt anyone. We‚Äôre not so different after all.

It‚Äôs understandable to get angry over these debates, really, but we need to remember that our real enemy is the people who would see our rights taken away again- the ones who‚Äôd see us dead, every last one of us. We need to stick together and lift each other up, because it‚Äôs hard being what we are in a world like this. Civil war will do the opposite of helping us. 

Again, do call out toxic behavior. Do raise your concerns when you have them. But keep it civil and respectful, don‚Äôt generalize or assume, and please, listen. Keep an open mind, hear what the other person has to say, give it some real thought, and respond compassionately. This won‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre suddenly friends with everyone, but it will for the most part keep things peaceful. We need that. 

The people who need that most are the ones who are new here, and the ones who are struggling. Imagine just starting to question who you are, coming to places like this to familiarize yourself with the community and maybe make a home, and the first thing you see being this war. Imagine being in a really bad place, being constantly worn down by the situation you‚Äôre in, and coming to one of the only safe, comfortable places you have to distract yourself only to find out that there‚Äôs so much hurtful conflict there too.

I know it‚Äôs a cliche thing to say, but we‚Äôre all in this together. In the real world we need to be allies, not enemies, because that‚Äôs the only way that we‚Äôll be strong enough to change things for the better. We need to stick together because if we don‚Äôt then our real enemies will be the ones who win.

Edit: I can‚Äôt respond to all of you, but I‚Äôm so glad that most of you seem to agree! We‚Äôre all family here, we need to support each other."	"As a moderator, this is why we always push for people to report things that are harmful. We don't like call-out posts where someone vaguely makes remarks about something else that may or may not even be about something that happened in our subreddit.

There's not much we can do if we can't see it, and there's only so many moderators out here.
With friends like these, who needs anemones?
I mean, ngl, as a trans man I *do* feel erased, but it's not transwomen that are doing it. 

It's cis people.
I will never understand why this ridiculous rivalry occurs. I've seen a lot of people talking about it like it's a new thing, but it's not. It was happening 10 years ago when I transitioned as well. It makes me sad because we're facing more danger than ever and yet we still fight amongst ourselves - and perhaps I hope that having been able to overcome gender we would also be able to overcome the need for petty gender based rivalries as well.

But apparently not.

But that is definitely not to say that is the dominant force in the trans community. I always stayed out of communities that engaged in that type of thing - well, I'm nonbinary so I don't have much of a choice - and I've always chosen communities which reject such silly nonsense, and include both binary and nonbinary people as part of a wider trans liberation movement. After all if trans men or trans women benefit at the expense of the other, then we all ultimately suffer, winners included.
I have never seen a trans man or a trans women say anything negative of the other half of the trans group
I mean it just happened that reddit is full of transfem and TikTok is full of transmasc...not like it matters anyways we're all the same
People in the comments denying that transgender transphobia isn't happening need to wake the fuck up. Non-binary people are also getting attacked (there's a trans celebrity blaming non-binary people for conservatives making medical transitioning harder).



There are trans men making TERF adjacent comments. Like transmisogyny makes them more manly.



There are trans women mocking/ignoring the struggles trans men go through. Because being a trans *man* must mean the transphobia that trans men face suddenly vanishes because of male privilege...


I see both trans men and women on transmed/truscum platforms. Like excluding ""different"" trans people will make the cissies love you. Fucking bootlickers.


A lot of people are saying ""it's the cis transphobes entering our subs. They're just trying to stir shit between us."" No, it's not cis transphobes doing this, it's us. We're being the transphobes. We are attacking each other, hurting each other, ignoring each other. It's like our suffering is a competition. Who gets misgendered the most? Who has the most dysphoria? Who has the most difficulty passing? Who is killed/r*ped the most? Who fucking cares? We're all in this together.


We need to grow the fuck up and listen to one another.
I‚Äôve been a part of the trans community for 15 years now.
- Trans women are treated as domineering and ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù and that‚Äôs wrong
- Trans men are treated as invisible and like they ‚Äúhave it easier‚Äù and that‚Äôs wrong
- Enbies are scarcely included and are often left out of the discussion, and that‚Äôs wrong
- Don‚Äôt even get me started on the mistreatment of intersex folk

None of this is new. There has always been some degree of infighting. Some amount of thinking the grass is greener. We are a coalition of related experiences, we‚Äôre supposed to be allies, not enemies. The only difference between back then and now is the massive increase in visibility we have among cis and questioning. It‚Äôs been a double edged sword because we‚Äôre seeing progress in some ways and regression in others.

We‚Äôre supposed to be brothers, sisters, and siblings in arms. When we fight each other, our opponents win.
Glad I haven‚Äôt witnessed any of this. I‚Äôve been kinda keeping to myself regarding my gender. Definitely not a pride issue, I just don‚Äôt have much reason to go talking to people about it, ya know?
We‚Äôre all the same.
They want to separate us.  I saw it in the 80s.  Together we can bring on change for everyone.  Hate spreads like fire.  Love is like honey. Honey sticks to you. Makes you sweet  Makes you feel good.  Spread love.
We are allies. I can feel it.

Why just yesterday while reading a work email addressed to me I felt quire reassured by the overuse of the ""he him"" pronoun even tho i am femme enby. 

Why? Well I'm hiding a bit. I couldn't put she/they in my signature so decided to start transitioning towards it and start with he/they. 

This person clearly thought I was transmasc and was going out of their way to use what they assumed were my desired pronouns. 

It felt good to have a pop-up ally out in the wild. Makes me think there are more.
Hugs for all my trans brethren ü§óü§óü§ó
We are all one and the same
I probably live under a rock.. I didn't know about this tbh :(
Identitarianism is a poison, people are not groups, people are unique individuals, no matter the race, orientation or identity. It does not matter where your evolution happened, you are still different from the others of your group.
The idea that some trans people would try to in any way say that other trans people are less important or struggle less seems really silly. It‚Äôs kind of like how within the lgbtq+ community as a whole, cis gay/lesbian people try to delegitimize bi and trans people, it literally doesn‚Äôt help anyone, and it‚Äôs not going to make cishet people respect you more. All trans people are equally important and valid
I was at a University orientation, once, and there was a table there for some outdoors club for women and non-binary people. I approached them, not knowing this, and they directed me to a different table, where a more general outdoorsman's club was hosting.

The interaction gave me pause. For the record, I don't blame anyone involved; but for context, I am at-present a man who is non-committally considering non-binary identification. They had no way of knowing that, though, nor does it really alter my social standing or priveledge--it makes sense that the most fitting organization for me would be the mainstream, male-dominated space. They could tell that from my outward gender performance.

And yet, I couldn't help but think... what about other non-binary people who perform their gender in a traditionally masculine way? There's this implicit association in our culture between femininity and oppression--which is a legitimate association to observe--but a side-effect of it is that the converse association is culturally prevalent, too. That is, marginal identities that are orthogonal to femininity are seen as implicitly feminine nevertheless.

My interaction with this outdoors club was brief, but I had the distinct sense that 'legitimate' non-binary performance within it was a much easier to achieve if you were performantly _feminine;_ and this binding of binary female coding with non-binary legitimacy is a hard thing to reconcile.

I don't really have a solution. There _should_ be spaces and organizations that exist _for_ marginalized people, and not for the service of the hegemony. But in maintaining these spaces, you run into an inherent taxonomy problem, because the qualities that make up any facet of people's identities can't be accurately sampled in a discrete, digital way. You _have_ to use heuristic approximations in your designations, and it's really difficult to do that while navigating representational trends that you might not necessarily _want_ to uphold.

I still think it's valuable to try, but I understand why these kinds of divisions happen. The feelings of exclusion and erasure are almost an inevitable consequence of this problem, and they _are_ valid and rational emotional responses to being confronted with identificatory boxes that don't quite fulfill their intended social function... but that doesn't make them any easier to deal with, either individually or communally.

I guess all we can do is keep trying--keep building community as well as we can, despite how messy it is.
Personally I think it's just that society is more bitchy about trans women. So we get talked about more. So we have a bigger presence.
Honestly, if trans people fight each other, what chances do we have to make a peaceful and safe community?
ESP seeing as this is all a divide and conquer tactic from the rightoids‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs not help them weaken our community.

You‚Äôre all valid: MTF, FTM, Enby, agender, intersex, queer etc.

That which divides us pales in comparison to what we have in common.
I think there's a real issue with people defining an out-group's behaviour by that group. I noticed a few months into my social transition (and engaging more in online spaces) that if a trans man (I'm FtM) said something TERFy then I'd think he was a dickhead, but if a trans woman said something that hurts trans men then I'd think *""trans women hurt trans men"".*

I believe this is a natural part of human psychology and we don't need to be ashamed of it, but that doesn't make it right. We need to learn to see the individual first before we see the group. And yeah I'd even include cis people and cis, straight men when I say that.
I want to say I'm sorry. I've been absolutely awful. Lately I've realized I'm narcissistic as fuck and I want to fix that. You are right, we shouldn't be enemies. In fact I'm looking for a lgbt support group near me to help address my internalized transphobia. So far Google says every group is at least an hour from where I live. I will make the time and effort to support my brothers and sisters. None of us should feel alone and I think that is one of the root causes for my own self loathing. Thank you
I guess I'm lucky because I've not seen much of this. But I have much love for my transmasc brothers and enby pals.
like i said in my comment on the Hunter Schafer post: they'll burn us all on the same pyre given half a chance. FtM and MtF folks are so many things to one another, but most foundationally we're *allies in a literal war*. Watch your allies' backs.
I love the energy of this and the related posts so hard

It's been getting to the point where I wondered if it was trolls stirring up division, so I'm grateful we're looking at this head on
Am Mtf dating someone ftm. We are better versions of ourselves with each other supporting. This sucks
I was thinking about this recently! Actual infighting has never happened where I could see it but, given that we are a large group full of individuals, it's simply impossible for it not to happen. The larger the group, the bigger the chance of there being actual scumbags in there and this might be a big reason why we don't get anything done.
Preach!
Dude I hate this (I agree obviously). It‚Äôs so dumb when people say they‚Äôre speaking for their trans group when it‚Äôs bs. As a trans man, I feel like we are dominating a lot of the social media spaces in general but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm okay with it. Also sometimes it changes and sometimes I see more trans women than trans men on social media but that does mean that that‚Äôs a bad thing. Either way I feel as though most of us have similar enough experiences that gender literally doesn‚Äôt matter half the time. We don‚Äôt need to have a gender war let‚Äôs just thrive in our transness ffs
We‚Äôre all fighting for the same rights and we‚Äôre in this together!

I know the world sucks and can get to us but we shouldn‚Äôt take it out on each other!
Marginalised people marginalising people.

For shame!

The ones doing this should *know better!*

But humans love to kick down huh.

Well, for anyone under our beautifully coloured LGBTQ+ umbrella who wants to discriminate against anyone else under that same umbrella, push yourself into the rain it's your own fault if you get wet
Guys honestly we have enough hate surrounding us anyway we can‚Äôt have Infighting
I didn‚Äôt know there was a rift.
What the? We at war with the homies. We got to stop fighting my fellow trans peeps. ‚úä I didnt even know this was going on.
Just remember folks, the bad apples usually seem to be the loudest. Doesn't mean it's the majority.

100% agree OP. Glad most of us have solidarity on this.
as a trans guy, i just wanna say, we are all trans
only difference is that we are trans in opposite directions
Personally I was unaware of this turf war among us, but I'm saddened that we can't get along.
my money is on bot / sock puppets from terfs and haters trying to divide us as a community.
I just always assumed that we were like quantum entangled particles, for every woman shedding a penis there is a man removing breasts to maintain the balance and that we‚Äôre all part of the same process helping to right the biological injustices that have trapped us all in misery.   

I don‚Äôt understand why they would want to be male, and they don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôd want to be female, which means we do understand a lot of what each other are going through.   

I for one am way too worried about all ‚Äúthe straight people‚Äù to have any issue with my trans brothers and sisters.

Is it really a thing? Feeling a bit guilty for not having noticing it. :/

I love my trans mascc bros. <3
I would stand against a million abusive trans women to stand with a single trans man.

I would also like to imagine there are very very few abusive trans women and men for that matter and I wouldn't be alone in standing and speaking in defense of others.

I don't understand this divide at all and honestly this is one divide I don't want to be educated on. I haven't seen it yet and that makes me feel horrible as everyone deserves as much support as possible.

I love everyone here. Trans men and women, NBs, allies, questioning, everyone on this sub  is amazing. I don't always agree with what I see people say but I love hearing about everyone's experiences it makes my chest all warm and makes me üòä 

There are only two subs that make me feel safe and like I have a home and this is one of them. ILYA <3
I feel Transfemme people can understand some struggles that cis women go through, like how women are vulnerable when it comes to unwanted attention from men. We all can relate to being harassed to some extent.
Trans woman can't make transmasc memes. If you feel under represented make transmasc memes. This is just another example of men wanting women to fix things for them without lifting a finger.
i‚Äôve been saying this all day regarding the whole truscum hunter schafer thing‚Ä¶ why the fuck are we now dividing our own community. where is this getting us. like fr what possible outcome can be reached with this infighting and wedge-driving between our own people. we are all trans, we all have (for the most part) the same experience with cis people and them not understanding us. how do we expect to move forward and gain access to the care and resources we need from government if we can‚Äôt act like adults, which is a big issue with them in the UK at least. i know this isn‚Äôt the main reason for lack of care access, but it‚Äôs a contributing factor that isn‚Äôt helping. anyone. at all. especially not binary trans people. also (in general) trans women have it significantly harder than trans men and enbies (in general) so please leave them alone especially over such arbitrary and insignificant things that don‚Äôt fucking matter thanks :)
I'm non binary,
Men are invisible,
And women get attention.
You binary folks literally asked for this üòÇ
Yeah this might be unpopular but after watching Hasan Piker talk about how the trans community eats/attacks itself. I kinda agree. It‚Äôs kinda batshit and why i tend to just stay out of the community and focus on myself.
As an enby, I need friends like these not enemies! Take my upbote
Agreed- thank you for what you do! You guys are awesome.
Shut up and take my upvote. Lol
Owl city throwback WOW
Yesss love the reference!!

I apologize for this but the pedantic Owl City fanatic within me requires me to inform you - the verse you're referring to is ""with fronds like these, well who needs anemones"". Sorry for being annoying ü§£
*Exactly*. I‚Äôm a trans guy (though not a binary one), and this is my thought exactly. Trans women get shit from society too, just in a different form. It‚Äôs transphobic Cis people who are actually erasing us.
Exactly. Cis people are the ones erasing us, not transfems.
To be more specific, I think it's transphobes who erase you.
I feel like trans masc people or trans men feel erased more maybe because it‚Äôs easier to pass for them typically. Cis people are definitely erasing trans folk as well, but trans men/trash masc nb typcially can pass better then transfem/trans women can do it can seem like theres not much representation there.
There have been arbitrary divisions in pride and community groups since they‚Äôve existed unfortunately. I remember even in the 90s hearing lesbians say they do a lot of work behind the scenes but get none of the spotlight (for pride events) and there is even division between those who argued ‚Äògay people are just like straights we want to get married and have a kid‚Äô and those who embraced diversion from mainstream society and had more exploratory ideas around lifestyle, sex, traditional family unit, etc. 


This is why intersectionality is so important; we‚Äôre better when we‚Äôre aware of these divisions and how they‚Äôre exploited. A rising tide lifts all boats. 

And to the OP point: Scrutinize divisive ideas you hear very carefully‚Äî are you signal boosting an anti trans message inadvertently? I worry posts like these are feeding into some ideological-political motivated imposters (i.e. trolls or provocateurs from right wing, incel, terf, etc. spaces)


And to reiterate I and most trans women love and support all our trans siblings
Seconded. Rivalries have been around forever, we need to remember to stick together if we‚Äôre ever to get anywhere.
I‚Äôve seen posts talking about the low amount of transmasc representation but that‚Äôs about it
I have seen a lot sadly (and often in RL)
I‚Äôm not on TikTok so I don‚Äôt know, but I agree. It doesn‚Äôt matter- we‚Äôre not so different. We all need to stick together.
Pardon my ignorance 


Where does this even happen?

In the usa? On social media in general?



I live in a small country where trans people barely exist, I have been on some discord setvers and lgbt hangouts (I have only been once to this and it was nice, lots of people) and the servers are almost empty 



The only thing I have noticed is that transmasc don't feel represented here on trans places on reddit, which is due to trans woman being more present on reddit 
There are also few enbie or xenogender posts 


When I'm on discord I see that trans masc representation is way bigger than transfem's 
It sucks and I get what transmasc feel here on reddit 

But like what are we all suppose to do?
We all should try to attract more transmasc to reddit and more transfems to discord and more enbies, intersex, xenogender people to everywhere


I still don't get and I haven't seen trans people being transphobic
Only once when I was on discord trying to get into a server and I was called a transcum (I made a post about this with a throwaway account, asking if I was transcum and I'm not, they had no idea what they were talking about) and they kept misgendering me a lot


Does this mean every trans masc is bad? Transphobic? Mean? No 


I will never get how people assume an entire group is like this or that when they just had a bad experience with one or 2 people
Seconded 100%. I‚Äôm transmasc non-binary, and I see some awful stuff and some wonderful stuff from all sides. We all really need to remember what our grade school teachers told us and put on our listening ears. Some understanding for and from everyone will do us a world of good.
Your point is 100% correct.

I still think there are probably some cis transphobes coming in and stirring shit up, though.
I agree. There‚Äôs always been stuff like this going on, and it‚Äôs always been shit. We‚Äôre all family here, and we should try our best to be a healthy one.
Yeah, I get it. And it‚Äôs definitely not everyone or anything, I‚Äôm just trying to address an in-fighting issue that‚Äôs been going on forever. Trans men feel erased, trans women feel like they‚Äôre being told to shut up, non-binary people aren‚Äôt really acknowledged at all. It seems to have gone up slightly as of late, so I‚Äôm just reminding people that we‚Äôre all on the same team.
We are definitely allies. It‚Äôs not everyone, for sure. I think for the most part we help each other. It‚Äôs just a few people in-fighting that gets a lot of attention.
Same to you sib! I love all of you guys.
Precisely.
It‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs not every post or anything. It‚Äôs kind of something that‚Äôs been going on forever. Trans men feel erased and underrepresented, trans women feel like they‚Äôre being silenced and called overbearing, non-binary people are barely in the conversation at all. A lot of it seems to stem from just a few trans women trying to diminish trans men‚Äôs struggles, just a few trans men being terf-y and trans misogynistic, and just a few binary trans people blaming non-binary people for lasting transphobia in general society. 

It starts as people voicing genuine concerns then just becomes a sort of in-fighting where people attack each other and play Oppression Olympics until everyone is left feeling miserable and ignored. It sucks for all parties involved.

We‚Äôre all one and the same, and we need to work together and lift each other up. 

Love to my trans siblings. üíô
I definitely agree that these feelings are natural and should be heard. All I want here is for people to try to keep it civil and understanding.

And yes, I suppose that really is the best we can do. We just have to keep trying.

All the best, sib. üíô
I think that definitely contributes. And it sucks for all of us in different ways. Trans women shouldn‚Äôt be constantly targeted and harassed, trans men shouldn‚Äôt be constantly ignored and infantilized, non binary people shouldn‚Äôt be blamed for Cis people‚Äôs bigotry or excluded from the conversation entirely. We just need to listen to each other.
I'm not aware of your previous actions, but thank you for owning up to them. That's a brave and responsible thing to do.
I appreciate the effort you‚Äôre aiming to make and agree we all should be self examining and putting in effort. As a side note I think when you say brothers and sisters it would be good to say siblings as well so as not to exclude our non-binary family too
What groups are you referring to? Are there like hangout places for trans people? If so i'm missing out.
It‚Äôs wonderful that you‚Äôve been able to recognize this and start changing! Desire to improve is a wonderful thing- what more could we ask for!

I used to be the same way too- don‚Äôt get me wrong. And trust me when I tell you that once you‚Äôve managed to shed most of your internalized transphobia not only will it help you improve your interactions with other people, it will help you love yourself more too. It‚Äôs very freeing.

I wish you well, and I hope you find a good group to be part of!
this and the trans meme sub are good at erasing nonbinary people im not gonna lie
Absolutely. We need to look out for each other.
So am I! I‚Äôm really glad to see I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this way. Y‚Äôall are my family and I hate the fighting so much. We just need to listen, be understanding, and lift each other up.
Agreed 100%.
Agreed!
Yeah, humans can be a real pain.
It seems like a lot of people didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm really glad it hasn‚Äôt gotten big enough for that yet.
Seconded. It looks like a lot of people didn‚Äôt know, and I think that‚Äôs a good thing tbh. That means it‚Äôs not as big as it seems to me.
Yeah, I agree. I almost didn‚Äôt post this because I don‚Äôt want to make this strange fight bigger than it already is, but I guess I just decided it was important to remind everyone of that solidarity. 

I‚Äôm glad too- I‚Äôm really happy this has gotten such a positive response. I guess my perception of how big it was got skewed by those few bad apples.
Stuff like this has been going on forever. It‚Äôs pretty common among any group of people, but especially marginalized people, for there to be disagreement between a few. It‚Äôs not a big turf war, as others have said here it‚Äôs just a few people with loud voices drowning out everyone who IS getting along.

Sending love, fam üíô
It‚Äôs always kind of been a thing, don‚Äôt feel bad about it. 

We love you too! The in-fighting is definitely a minority.
I‚Äôd also add that trans men are just as capable of being awful, but I agree with the overall sentiment here. We‚Äôre not all that different, and especially in a world like this we need to stick together.
>Trans woman can't make transmasc memes. If you feel under represented make transmasc memes. This is just another example of men wanting women to fix things for them without lifting a finger.

ah, yes, transmisandry.  the opposite of transmisogyny.

I don't know you, nor can I speak for you, but your statement here is exactly what the OP was talking about.
I‚Äôm not saying you should make memes that don‚Äôt apply to you. I‚Äôm saying we need to stop this arguing. That goes for everyone- trans women, trans men, and non-binary people. 

Trans men shouldn‚Äôt blame trans women for erasure. Trans women shouldn‚Äôt diminish trans men‚Äôs struggles. No one should forget that non-binary people are real and valuable. 

We‚Äôre not so different. We need to stick together and help each other.

Also, on the ‚Äúmen wanting women to fix thing for them‚Äù point, I‚Äôm not sure if you mean me or not, but I‚Äôm not a man. I‚Äôm non-binary.
Sorry, I don‚Äôt think I understand what you mean? I‚Äôm also non-binary, but I don‚Äôt see how anyone is asking for anything?
> the trans community eats/attacks itself.  
  
Cis people saying dumb stuff like this is why I never watch any of the """"""trans friendly"""""" content creators.  
  
The ""cis community"" has been at war with itself for almost all of recorded history but God forbid trans people have a little inter-community discourse on the interent..
A leftist streamer talking about a community he isn't part of eating or attacking its own is so filled with irony I might as well be turning into metal.

As if leftists and content creators don't get into fights on a damn near daily basis.
It's from Finding Nemo.
I think it probably has less to do with trans guys passsing more, and more to do with the fact that those who don't pass are seen as women, and therefore non-threatening, unlike trans women who are easier to paint as predators. So, transphobes prefer to focus on trans women with their rhetoric, which leaves the concerns of trans men almost completely ignored in the conversation from all sides.
I feel erased because if I go to events where it is explicitly advertised that I am welcome there, it actually turns out to be a group ""for women"", they welcome us with ""Hello ladies"" (causing intense dysphoria) and have even tried to include me in conversations about the patriarchy by explicitly saying directly to me that ""As a man, must have been nice not to face harassment."" And the abuse comments which I have mentioned before.

I have been sexually harassed and assaulted before (that was fortunately fairly minor) and it is triggering for me to be referred to like that.

It is nothing to do with whether I pass or not. Maybe from their end, as they seem to think it solves every problem.
I've heard Tik Tok is more popular among transmascs whereas more transfemmes prefer Reddit, which is why there are so many transfemme posts here. I don't have Tik Tok so idk if there's more transmasc representation over there or not.
Yeah, and that is a real problem that needs to be addressed, but we can hopefully do so in good faith. I love my trans-masc brothers and enby pals! And I want this to be a space they feel comfortable being in!
I guess I just spend time with the right people
It‚Äôs not in every post or anything, but it does happen in bigger ones that come up. There are just some people who generalize or don‚Äôt listen and empathize. I just want to encourage people to be open-minded and understanding, not accuse anyone or anything.
I just Googled lgbt support groups near me
Thats good. We seriously need to stand together. All trans people on one side.
People who feel strongly about something tend to broadcast those views a lot more. Sometimes for the better, sometimes not. I totally understand. I'm really glad you made this post *because* of the overwhelming amount of good responses. It was a nice reminder that this community as a whole rocks.
I don't know what other like to be transmasc. I never will. I don't know what it's like to experience gender euphoria from masculinity. I have no frame of reference for the transmasc experience. All I could do is parrot other memes I've seen. What can I do to help increase the amount of transmasc representation?
I'm an outsider, but I think I have the context for what this is about. Some people feel trans women / trans fem people are much more visible in shared trans places on Reddit than trans men / trans masc people and there has been (a sometimes heated) back and forth about that with some people feeling like there's pressure on one group to do more than the other. The comment above yours is a continuation of that discourse. It looks like it came out of nowhere without context, but that's the backstory of it.

Just providing that information in case you were sitting there thinking 'what the fuck was that about?'
I mean. I didnt say it was a bad thing to have that discourse. Just that I‚Äôm not interested in it and more focused on making myself survive.
Oh no. He said that too. The left eats itself too. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs accurate and something I‚Äôve thought before as well. I agree we need to support each other as well.
That joke has been around waaayyyyy before either lol
My bad - it is a lyric in an owl city song, saw the other comment and got too excited ü§£ I need to watch Nemo again
Yes, exactly this right here
I use both and yeah it is like that.
yes, I mostly too, but sometimes I have met terrible people. 

&#x200B;

I understand, that it is hard to understand, that the others want, what you want to get rid of, but sometimes how you phrase that is important.
Thanks! I found a meetup here in Bangkok. Didn't know there would be such a thing for English speakers.
Definitely.
Yeah, I agree. I love this community a lot, I just hate it when stuff like in-fighting and prejudice comes up. I suppose this is a good reminder that most of us aren‚Äôt like that.
> All I could do is parrot other memes I've seen. What can I do to help increase the amount of transmasc representation?

well, you can start with not saying like this when referring to trans men, because very few of them are misogynistic

>This is just another example of men wanting women to fix things for them without lifting a finger.
I‚Äôm not sure if this was meant for me specifically or not, but either way I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre right. Stuff like this has been going on in basically every marginalized community forever, to an extent, but I‚Äôve just seen it pop up a bit more lately and wanted to address it.
I'm still gonna look at him funny trying to comment on strife within a community he isn't part of and, theoretically, is a supposed ""ally"" towards. It's none of his business.
It's the long-awaited punchline to Marlin's joke about the mollusk and sea cucumber. He finally gets to tell it at the end of the movie.

He wasnt wanting to comment on it anyway. Hell, this is why I don‚Äôt bother with discussing this crap. Have your win.

Transphobia should not be tolerated.	"The amount of transphobia in subreddits is disgusting. The amount of memes and comments that make fun of trans people (especially MtF) is horrid. If your humor is pointing out and making fun of people‚Äôs insecurities, then you‚Äôre not a funny person. 

The hate that trans people are getting because of ‚Äúcompetitive sports‚Äù is astronomical. Look, I‚Äôm sorry your favorite person didn‚Äôt win but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should completely insult the hell out of someone and deny their identity. What happened to some decent respect?

This is hate speech, it‚Äôs harassment, and it is harmful. 

To all my fellow trans friends, I recommend to stay away from big subreddits like r/memes because I‚Äôve noticed they encourage transphobia. Let‚Äôs not support subreddits that don‚Äôt take accountability for their messed up actions.

edit: MtF not FtM"	"> Look, I‚Äôm sorry your favorite person didn‚Äôt win

Implying thy even knew who was playing üòÇ
There‚Äôs been a lot more as of recently for some reason. I would expect a few because this is Reddit, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where every other joke punches down and claims to be satire. Is it even funny anymore? How many times can you laugh at the same joke before it gets old?
I understand jokes, which are made to make people laugh. I understand jokes which are polite

But jokes which are made to say offensive things? That's too much.

&#x200B;

>The amount of transphobia in subreddits is disgusting. 

Let me fix that for you. The amount of transphobia in ~~subreddits~~ the world is disgusting. 

The subreddits are just a reflection of popular transphobic views in the world, mostly the US since it's the majority of Reddit. Yeah, the US is transphobic, and even allies can be ignorant as fuck and say shit that just isn't funny or downright mean, even if they don't realize it.

We have an uphill battle to fight for acceptance. That's why people are terrified when they find out they're trans, when a transwoman tries to go outside in clothes they feel comfortable in, when we speak to doctors about transitioning.

That's our life. We can avoid subreddits but it's much harder to avoid the reality of our world.
I've been noticing this a lot on r/memes lately specifically. There's been a lot more LGBT themed posts that are good but I've seen some pretty clearly transphobic ones recently with those saying something about it getting harrassed
Reddit mods will never remove hate speech unless you're in an lgbtqia+ friendly sub and even then its sometimes a coin toss
Friendship ended with transphobic r/memes, now r/dankmemes is my best friend.
you should see r/teenagers.
Yep, I‚Äôve leaved most massive subreddits cause of the constant misogynistic and transphobic humor and comments. I don‚Äôt need that on my every day.
I am surprised to hear FtM is getting more ridiculing than MtF. Youd think ""super manly men"" would make fun of a girl wanting out of their incorrect body.
Even trans people are posting that on trans subs and I hate it
I noticed on reddit especially no matter where you go there's transphobia. I recommend the shinigami eyes browser add on for people who aren't on mobile
r/dankmemes is better than r/memes by the tiniest bit, but fairly bad overall. best ones are ones like r/traa r/196 r/19684 and similar ones
This whole antiwork shit has really blown open a giant gaping cess pit of transphobia. Don't look at those threads.
I was very surprised today when i got banned from a subreddit for denouncing transphobia, and then when asking the mod about it, they told me i was bigoted :D
So yeah r/trans is safe and i'm now gonna stay within here, not gonna explore this godamn hell hole of a website anymore.
Reddit really needs to train its moderators in spotting hate speech against trans people. I've reported people outright using slurs or telling us we deserve to die for being trans, only to have Reddit's moderation team tell me it's not hate speech. 

Subreddit mods are great. I feel like Reddit's site wide mods harbor some deep ignorance and/or a few transphobes.
it‚Äôs so normalized and it makes me so uncomfortable. i literally joined all these trans subs bc of it.
No one's holding a gun to your head and making you go to those subs. It's a form of self-harm to continue to do so. You either accept that transphobes exist or you waste your life fighting against them, which is pointless because they get off on the conflict. What *really* upsets them is *your success* (like that girl in sports) so get off of Reddit and do something.

Come here for support or whatever else but why engage with these people? Would you go to their church/neighborhood BBQ/cousin wedding and try to argue with them? Then why do it on the internet? It's the same damn thing.
What really hurts and saddens me more than anything, is that people don't seem to see trans people as HUMAN. This whole argument with trans athletes having an ""unfair advantage"", (despite trans athletes competing in the Olympics since 2004 and no evidence showing they've taken opportunities away from anyone), is just the reality that society is not comfortable with trans people existing. So people pick a battle over a nonissue, claiming they're doing it in the name of ""feminism"" so cis females have their rights protected, and it's such a gross mess. Especially with banning kids from playing sports with their friends, with the gender they align with. It's so unnecessary and like people just want us to be in a third category, cast away from everyone else, so we don't take up or invade their space. I've never been more passionate about trans rights than now because I can't imagine being a kid and growing up learning of anti-trans legislation and your whole identity being disputed. I know trans people have gained more rights and visibility, due to those before us fighting with everything they had, and there has been significant progress but the progress needs to continue. The Trevor Project did a study recently showing 85% of trans youth said their mental health was negatively affected due to the state laws discussing trans rights. Come on, people! Do better!
Thank you truly for making this post.

I felt like I was just going crazy looking at the front page of reddit today. Just saw this post on and could not believe the amount of upvoted, hateful, derogatory comments against a mod who had participated in an interview:[https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sd8g28/if\_the\_fox\_news\_interview\_has\_you\_concerned\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sd8g28/if_the_fox_news_interview_has_you_concerned_about/)

Why all the hate? Well, the mod had the audacity to be trans, autistic and not work 40 hours a week. The mod appearantly ""makes the movement look bad"". My god, anyone is allowed to be antiwork. You're not invalid because you don't work fulltime/any other reason. Then I saw that places like r/Cringetopia had picked up on the story, and it too had degrading comments about the interviewed person that had hundreds of upvotes: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/scx5ce/fox\_news\_interview\_with\_mod\_of\_rantiwork/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/scx5ce/fox_news_interview_with_mod_of_rantiwork/)

I kept scrolling, just looking for *one* comment that called out the hateful behaviour but found none. I'm very grateful I found your post here, makes me feel a little more sane.
And guess what's on the front page currently, a deliberate ""Be transphobic, you're free here!"" megathread ""shitpost"" because of hate is just shitposting with no real impact on real people /s

Can we have one goddamn day where our existence isn't a controversy? Like, one? It gets real tiring after a few years.
r/Cringetopia is also extremely transphobic and banned me for being trans
There's been a huge surge in transphobia after the r/antiwork debacle.

Much like Caitlyn Jenner, you can call someone an absolute piece of shit without resorting to transphobia.
i barely comment on r/memes so i haven't seen transphobia yet there but like some video memes subreddits i have.
[deleted]
Hm yeah ik what you mean I'm almost in no lgbtq subreddit. I looked in r/memes and sorted with controversial but I surprisingly only found one post about gays (not homophobic) and yeah there were some homophobic comments but way more that agreed with the post. I'm was really surprised by it maybe I was just lucky but yeah.
 Agreeded.
The whole r/antiwork drama escalated things to the point I don‚Äôt feel safe on Reddit anymore. I might look for alternatives.
Thank you so much!!

Am ftm and i just had scrolled through those subreddits with the rampant transohobia, and it honestly hurt me a lot inside since i only came out 5 months ago and i have anxiety anyways.

Your (and other people's too ofc) comment(s) made me feel so much better now. Tysm üò≠üò≠üò≠

Oh yes lets focus on Memes and Jokes instead of real Transphobia .  
I do admit yes there are everywhere Transphobes etc and Transphobia is a real thing .  
But holy shit yall guys really got a huge stick up your arse if you cant take a joke/meme .  
Honestly nowadays you can hate on Straights and make memes about them en masse and no one bats an eye , make one joke about Transgender People or an Homosexual and you get immediatly canceled.  
And well yes there is much hate about Sports currently , but that is an hard mess to solve anyways when TransFemales are competing against cis Females which is obviously a good thing , but then get Points in the Number you usually get in the Male equivalent of that Sport.  
Honestly everyone no matter if youre part of LGBTQIA+ or not , all should learn to chill the fuck out and just laugh about themself thanks to a Meme and come together instead of canceling eachother like a bunch of pussies .
I mean if they‚Äôre a joke they‚Äôre a joke, attacks are attacks but drawing the line is tremendously difficult‚Ä¶
Especially again when they‚Äôre not attacks and merely jokes‚Ä¶ not an easy subject. 
Furthermore trans women obliterate cis women in sports, this is not a joke or an attack this is a fact. The world isn‚Äôt black or white it‚Äôs very grey, sometimes it you who‚Äôs opinion needs to be adjusted to fit the world better‚Ä¶ my two cents
I'm sure they care so much about women's sports they're also in favor more coverage and more equal pay for woman athletes, right? ...right?
You just called out so many people that pretend to care so they can be jerks to trans people.
Ol‚Äô Dave ‚ÄúTeam TERF‚Äù Chapelle did just ever so much to normalize transphobia and the attendant hate that feeds it.
I remember when I was completely harrassed for pointing out a meme was in fact 'punching down' on trans people
exactly. if it‚Äôs actually funny, and you aren‚Äôt meaning to offend anyone, then go ahead and make a joke. it‚Äôs when people make attack helicopter jokes and get annoyed at us asking them to stop
it sucks and its really hard to control because of how many posts we get. feel free to hit me up when u see posts like that
Usually they just lock the sub and prevent meaningful discussion.
Dank memes is worse imo. They‚Äôre part of so many posts in r/onejoke, it‚Äôs insane
Counterpoint:

You absolutely should *not* see r/teenagers
I'm too old to go there anyway
Yeah, I notice that trans women are usually the subject of easy to spot transphobia on reddit (go on any popular meme sub and all the ""trans jokes"" are about mocking women with different anatomy). Trans men can still be subjected to this kind of transphobia, but a lot of transphobes just don't realize that they exist and/or invalidate them by not acknowledging their presence. Terfs are aware of trans men, but their demonizing is still centered almost entirely on trans women. I am curious as to where OP is finding abundant FtM centered bigotry because we are usually just left out of the conversation/mockery entirely
Sorry sorry my mistake. I meant mtF. Ill fix that
if you take a look at my comment history, you'd see what a *great time* I've been having with that today....
I try telling people that Fox News does like a dozen stories a day where they interview untrained people and try to paint them as the face of some movement or another. They get forgotten about by the time they are done airing. That the real harm that Fox wanted to do was sow discord among the community. 

But I know they won't listen. Most of the users there aren't even antiwork, they just want someone to hear them bitch and moan while they engage proudly in all the things wrong with modern work culture.
>think of a better way to fight these toxic people

If only there was a way, it's disgusting to see this amount of disrespect towards Trans people. 

Whatever we do, they acknowledge it like ""attention seeking"" and what not, bullshit.. They don't even wanna listen when you wanna explain and stuff..
Can you explain the antiwork drama and how it‚Äôs correlating to trans people? I‚Äôm kinda confused about that.
You got some fat privilege there, do you know how stupid you sound or should we tell you?
Empathy: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

i'll show you what humor is:

ratio + you're transphobic
Are you talking to yourself in the mirror, buddy?
Counterpoint, then instead of simply separating by gender, why not body type? Imo that‚Äôs more fair since some woman are bigger than others and have more muscle mass (The same for men too). Wouldnt that make it more fair then?
Asking a bit too much from the transphobes there
That's better way to say what I meant

If you do not want to offend someone, it doesn't make you really bad person

And if someone feel like that, say ""sorry, I didn't mean to"". If people would act like this, we would be perfect society

Thank you. Glad to see the mods of r/memes are good people, unlike 1/4 of its users (geusstimatating)
Oh I didn't know that sorry
yes
count yourself lucky. it‚Äôs awful.
Ah I see.
The person interviewed by fox was a non binary individual. They looked like the stereotype, and Fox News picked them because of it. They also didn‚Äôt do the interview very well. It was a shame, because now there‚Äôs people on many different subreddits making fun of their identity, and using wrong pro nouns on purpose. Some of the subreddits are the big ones, and mods don‚Äôt care.
what do you mean privilege? the privilege of not having paper skin and caring more about real issues than mean jokes? sorry not sorry.
my empathy for overly-sensitive, sheltered, out-of-touch babies can only go so far. i understand what its like to be discriminated against. i understand what its like to have hurt feelings. best to stop caring what people say about you and being a miserable crybaby. tolerance begets tolerance. people have better things to do than bow to your feelings
And because you are referring to the r-word in that, I am reporting you. Again, insulting minorities including people who are neurodivergent shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated. You think I‚Äôm sensitive but in reality, you don‚Äôt know an ounce of respect because you‚Äôre a fucking edgelord on the internet.
mmm. not everyone will be happy but as long as your intentions are good then it‚Äôs fine
PLEASE get some sleep it‚Äôs not healthy
It‚Äôs ok! No need to apologise, I was just warning you. It can feel like a real gut punch to have to find that out yourself

So if you barely care about what people think and their feelings, why are you even commenting here? You obviously care because you‚Äôre mad at trans people getting insulted over transphobic jokes. Also, isn‚Äôt it natural when people insult you, you call them out on it? From what I‚Äôm getting is that whenever we get insulted and punched down you just want us to roll over on our backs and let it happen because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfunny.‚Äù 

Humor is subjective and calling a trans woman a man is not funny at all- it‚Äôs just rude. These are the so-called ‚Äújokes‚Äù you are mentioning. If you think that‚Äôs funny, then you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed on this subreddit.
Well sure do that , but im prefer to be an fucking edgelord instead of being a soft bitch , that cries over fucking jokes .yall should rather fight against real transphobia , but i guess you need to see an fellow Transgender being butchered on an alleyway near your House(which sadly happend really in my town, since itsinfested with fucking NeoNazis) to understand that these Jokes are literally not worth getting mad at .Since im literally an Minor in terms of Disabillity i dont care if im ""nOt AlLoWeD"" to use the ""R-Word""  
EDIT:isnt it kinda almost ""Hatespeech"" aswell to literally call an whole SubReddit Transphobic ? when there are surely more than enough people that dont give a shit about Transgender or maybe are even Allies ? .
im commenting because all i ever see trans ppl do online is complain. im frustrated with the general state of the community. its pathetic. and no i dont want you to roll over and let it happen lol. i would prefer, if anything, for trans people to dish out offensive humor as well, rather than cry about every little insult thrown our way. 
also, maybe i just shouldnt attempt to connect with other trans ppl online.maybe i should avoid trans spaces altogether because clearly if i dont 100% agree with whatever stupid fucking hivemind the rest of the LGBT seems to be apart of, i shouldnt be allowed in LGBT spaces lol."	sd967q	trans	731	0.97	2022-01-26 15:57:03
So they put a Trans girl in the apartment next to me, and it's wild. Two completely different worlds.	"I'm gunna call this person Sherry.

Sherry, like me, is Transgender. I think it's weird that they put the Trans girls in the back corner of the complex, but whatever. I'm heiring (erring?) on the side of actual coincidence and not some weird form of segregation? Anyway.

Sherry and I come from two radically different backgrounds. Coming out was... not good for her. Sherry has been in rehab (and I think jail) for some hard drug use. Not a tooth in her skull. Has a live-in caretaker, is mostly deaf, chain smokes, raps Linkin Park and ICP on the porch at all hours of the day (it's not fantastic). Trouble with volume control. Confrontational. Self-inflicted bruises that she does for her OF account. Wants to pet every dog that passes by. Corrects people when they misgender her. Brought me and my son a Papa Murphy's pizza that she got with EBT. A caring, generous person. Desperate to prove her worth in a world that has shut her out and dismissed her.

By all accounts my life is different. When I came out to my parents I was not ostracized. I knew I was safe, I had support. Did get a divorce but you can't win them all, right? Overall, I'm safe, my life is good. I stick to the sidelines, I keep my head down, I stay out of the purview of others. I don't correct people when I'm misgendered. I would be invisible if I could.

Not Sherry. Sherry is loud as fuck. She says some Transmedical stuff to try to validate her own existence. ""I have XXY chromosomes, so I'm valid as a woman"". Because she's never known acceptance like I have. She hates her old persona and ridiculed him in front of me. I said maybe that person chose that life path to cope with something that ate them up inside. Maybe she should be gentle with herself and especially with her old self. He gave her everything he had. It wasn't much, but it was all of him. And now he's gone. He did that for her. This sentiment was completely new to her.

She likes to regularly talk about how she's kind and caring. If I had a drink for every time I heard the phrase ""that's just the kind of person I am"" I'd be Hunter S Thompson. Whereas she projects, I just outwardly and kinda openly hate myself. I hate being Trans. I don't want to be seen. I don't want to be validated. I just wanna disappear. I just wanna be a fighter. I just wanna stand up for myself. I just wanna rap Linkin Park on my porch at 3 in the morning. I just wanna tell people that I'm a good person even if I struggle to believe it. I just wanna ask if I can pet every dog that passes by. I just wanna be like Sherry.

I don't really know what the point of this is. I was going to journal it but I thought maybe it would mean something to someone else. She means a lot to me. She's resilient, she's the advocate for herself that I want to be.

If this isn't just some absolute bullshit for how the reception of your coming out can pivotally change the course of your life, I don't know what is. If you have a parent or parents that are Transphobic, homophobic, please be safe. Find a friend first, or a resource.

Anyway. I'm gunna make myself another one, y'all have a good night and you're valid and have you been working out? You're absolutely glowing."	"I‚Äôm sure Sherry sees you, living a quiet, independent life and raising your son, and she wishes she could be you too.
>She hates her old persona and ridiculed him in front of me. I said maybe that person chose that life path to cope with something that ate them up inside. Maybe she should be gentle with herself and especially with her old self. He gave her everything he had. It wasn't much, but it was all of him. And now he's gone. He did that for her. This sentiment was completely new to her. 

Genuinely I have not heard such a beautiful and empathetic statement, I wish everyone could hear or see this perspective of self compassion. I love the way you write and the words you had to say <3
It sounds like the both of you could learn a lot from each other. I suspect you both already have.
Thank you for sharing this üíñüíñ
This was actually really interesting to read. My coming out has been so different, that it just hits hard remembering there‚Äôs people who‚Äôs hole life changed because of the way they reacted. 

I really do hope Sherry can get help, specifically a therapist. 

(Also props to you for having a journal to write this kinda stuff in. Journaling can really help some people so I hope it‚Äôs been helping you)!
Damn onion cutting ninjas. Good luck to you both, and I hope you eventually get to a point where you feel safe to publicly affirm your gender and stand up for yourself. Scratch that, I know you will, just give it time. <3
I am cry, OP.

Your framing of things resonates with me. I'd say I am somewhere between both you and Sherry, and I wish I were even a little more like her.
Hey, just so you know, you're valid too. We're all different, and we all look at others and think 'damn, I wish I could be more like them'. Somebody looks at you that way, you inspire them, and you can be proud of that. Don't sell yourself short on what you think you should be or do.
This was great to read!!  <33  thanks for sharing :))
very interesting slice of life there, thanks for sharing <3
I'm fairly close to a transmasc version of sherry honestly, and seeing your perspective of her is... very comforting.
Thanks for sharing üíúü´∂üèº
This is kind of poetic.  

Give Nevada by Imogen Binnie a read, if you have a chance. It's a book written by a trans woman, about a trans woman. And there are some diatribes in there that are very similar to the one you're describing here. You might relate to it.  

And thank you for sharing your story!
this is really nice to read. thanks for sharing OP!
You have a talent for writing. You honored Sherry with this post. I respect your will to hide, but please consider bringing more of your words to light. Please.
(Ps: not part of this beautiful community, was scrolling and I am glad this caught my eye).
This is really moving. Thanks for sharing
It sounds to me like you're both good influences for each other.
so does she refer to her old self as ""he/him""?
This is an awesome story and sounds like the plot of a trans Mitch Albom novel or something!
How cool would it be if op had DID and sherry is her altar and she imagines the personalities live in different apartments when they share the light..

M. Night shamolanalawn
With dick or no dick some pople gonna be a dick.
She sounds like my ghost of Christmas future! Well that suggests I‚Äôll ever properly transition at all! HAHAhaheheeh‚Ä¶ fuck. Either she sounds lovable heh
There really is a huge breadth of experience among transgender people. I'm glad the two of you are getting along, rather than not being able to do so.

> heiring (erring?)

Erring. It comes from the same linguistic root as ""error"".
That's really kind. I don't know what direction you travel on this Trans journey but please respect him/her that came before you. They literally and figuratively gave their life for you, because you deserve it! Thank them. Be patient with them. Don't hate them. Because they loved you. I do too.
I'm definitely going to remind my girlfriend of this when she sees photos of herself pre-transition or says mean things about how she used to be.
I had goosebumps reading this. Truly beautiful.
not sure what good it did/does but it felt important to honor her. <3
Ha my mom asked me if I was still journaling or if I keep a diary now that I'm living as a woman.
That's wonderful, I'm glad you were able to take something good from it. <3
Yes, as do I.
Wdym cool?
We get along great. She's a riot, I'm the quiet. Thanks for the cl**err**ification! That's why they pay you the big bucks.
I get that this is a helpful way to think about it for you, and that makes it useful and meaningful.

It doesn‚Äôt work like this for some of us; and is for some of us an actively harmful thing to say.

Describe it like that for yourself - that‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôve found a way to contextualise something that makes it less painful for you! - I would suggest avoiding making it sound like a universal thing, though.

To my mind; I am the only me that ever existed. There was no person who came before me - the person people thought I was was simply a mask over pain. I‚Äôm still the same person I was before; just a happier and less hurting version.
I'm actually really glad I transitioned late instead of as a teen, much as I'd love to have the body and looks I'd have gotten if I did. It gave me the chance to spend half my life as a boy and the next half as a girl. It gives me a unique viewpoint most don't get the chance to experience. I'm proud as fuck of being trans. You can't misgender me because I don't have a gender. I'm something new, created from sheer force of will. Someone who looked at the hand fate dealt them and said fuck this, I want to try again. That person I was before, they always were and always will be a part of that. The part that comes out to defend me when threatened, the armor that shields me from petty insults, the strength to deal with situations I might not otherwise be able to. I may not be that person anymore, but they'll always be there if I need them.
I too love this perspective, and now I‚Äôm trying to not cry into my lunch ‚ù§Ô∏è
It was a hard habit for me to crack until one of you kind redditors gave me the perspective that I shared here, and it has given me a completely new outlook that I really, really needed.
Awe, no you! I really hope you do gain some comfort from the comments and the community in general. You'll get there! I still struggle with it myself, but I do generally correct people when they misgender me, for example. :) 

If I'm being honest, I was pretty startled that someone would never correct others when they get misgendered, partially because I know it can be done casually as well if you're not confrontational like me.
I completely understand we have different perspectives and experiences, I didn't mean to invalidate yours unintentionally. 

I heard specific words from her that I use myself when describing pre-transition or pre-coming out, like ""that guy was X"" or ""he did Y"". I felt it was safe to include that because she showed a lot of targeted anger toward a former persona as I did, and I just wanted to share what helped me get through that.
100% I read OPs story and I couldn't even comprehend what they were saying. Like there's only ever been one me, I'm just a much happy me then I was in the past.
I felt the same, I'm me, and always have been. I don't owe anything to the unhappy version of myself because that's just me.
Yaaaas this!
This is YOUR story and YOUR thread. Ofc it is okay"	xwxc0r	trans	613	0.99	2022-10-06 05:37:00
I tried to be happy but I so scared that people will make fun of me for being ‚Äúme‚Äù (I get misgendered to a f tonne that I tell of people in public then I would cry in public). Here are some photos before I got mad.		"Who the fuck is looking at you and seeing anything but woman?
I'm legit confused why and how would anyone misgender you. You look and are so pretty and more like a woman than many cis women I know.
Know the feeling darl. There is such a disconnect with how I see myself vs how others see me. Stay strong and know you're gorgeous x
Look how pretty you are!
There is just something wrong with the people who misgender you cause you look wonderful and pass amazingly
You are stunning! Sorry you're being treated like that.
Misgender people back, that's what I do. Nothing better than calling an old male bigot Janice and watching how pissed they get. If someone makes fun of you so what? It has no power over you if you give it no power. They want you to cry, they want you to feel bad. Fuck em all. Be happy and piss them off.
You look very feminine. The only reason I could think that you are being misgendered is your voice or mannerisms. Voice is such an important factor in whether we are read as male or female. Would you be comfortable posting a voice clip? Or if you feel it‚Äôs your voice look into voice therapy or surgery?
had to make sure you weren‚Äôt a trans masc who hasn‚Äôt started transitioning yet. You are a beautiful woman, i definitely echo voice training
Hello new crush üò≥ screw those people. They‚Äôre jealous at how amazing you look
honestly have no idea how many misgendered you. Unless your voice betrays you. It‚Äôs the only thing I can think of. But sweetie. You are a gorgeous woman. Be proud. You are legit gorgeous and your outfits on point.
Imma start throwing hands for you on god!
So beautiful!
lovely üéà
Dear you look beautiful don‚Äôt let other people dictate your beauty and appearance and happiness dear enjoy your beauty and happiness üòòüòòü•∞ü•∞ü§óü§óüë©‚ù§Ô∏è
If someone misgenders that gorgeous face then they are blind and dumb. You got this girl!!!
You look like a beautiful woman. You‚Äôd have to tell me you were trans
From my perspective, i bet a majority of people who do that to you are envious, jealous that you have worked hard to present as a female/woman.  Rise above that and love yourself.
How do you see a man there? If I saw you in person and didn't know this was a trans subreddit I would say you where born female
Look good to me üòÅ
You are very gorgeous.
What a sweet smile you have!
Such a cutie!
Be happy to spite the haters. Let them keep their hate.
You're beautiful and wonderful!
Girl you look way too good for any sane person to misgender
Girl you're hella pretty I'm jealous üò≠ screw them, you do you‚ù§Ô∏è
you‚Äôre beautiful. don‚Äôt let insecure people bring you down üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüíò
Mis gendered ??? HOWWW???!!! Likee
Literally HOWWW!!! I Don‚Äôt see anything but a women ?? How would anyone ?? Uhh wha??

I almost don‚Äôt want to believe you bc you pass

But you still look so good, you pass 

The only thing MAYBE?? Is the eyes? They look tierd? But like you can‚Äôt change that ? 
Maybe your voice? But idk i haven‚Äôt heard you before Soo idk 

But your a pass in my book
Beauty.
very nice  never give up. if we cannot bask in our own peronal development and beliefs were even more a prisoner in society . love and hugs there wll be more better days than not
You are flipping beautiful. Pretty sure you are a top 1% of attractive women in any room you are in. I see nothing that clocks you. Some people are just filled with hate.
People are always gonna hate. We just need you show we don‚Äôt give af. Misgendering, fuck em. You don‚Äôt need their respect because they obviously could never share space with youüíñ
Well you look very cis to me. You actually remind me of an old friend :)
You are absolutely gorgeous don‚Äôt let people‚Äôs hate of themselves ruin the person you are. Live your life to make you happy because that‚Äôs all that matters. Be yourself you are a beautiful woman
You must live in a super conservative place. Your outfits, makeup, and hair are always on point. By the way your new hair is gorgeous as I said last time üòä
Esp now there are bigots that kinda look for us so they can insult us. Jealous woman tends to do this also..ü•∫

But you're very passable so if you get misgendered it's from that it's not because you're not pretty. 

It's difficult being hurt by anyone for no reason that's the part I have trouble with.  
ü§óü§óü§óü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è
Not going to lie, you're my transition goals now.
I LOVR your look girl! :) Keep on being you. The world became a better place when you decided to be you ‚ù§Ô∏è
They‚Äôre probably just mad that you‚Äôre more put together and beautiful than most of the women they know. How they know you‚Äôre trans is where I‚Äôm confused. I wouldn‚Äôt know just seeing you and I am trans too so I feel like I notice things other people wouldn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre just looking for people to hate at this point because their lives are miserable. If I do notice another trans person I just go out of my way to be gender affirmative.
Yeah you still gorgeous anyway! I love who you are I respect it
Gorgeous!
You are beautiful and just remember that no matter what pronouns someone calls you, you are the one who knows who you truly are. If they don‚Äôt respect you and your pronouns, they can just F off.
Girl you look absolutely stunning. They just hate you because your had the courage to be yourself rather then what society tells you to be.
As far as FFS,take your time and decide what you want to change. Find a surgeon that will work with you and is recommended by bunches of others. Do whatever makes you happy with yourself.
No one can actually take away who you are. If they could then pushing cis gender identity on us would actually work. No matter what others say you're you.

If passing matters to you, you've nailed it.
Oh girl! You are so beautiful! I know it's hard but don't let the haters get you down. You are trying to be happy and live your authentic life and that is the most important thing.
Beautiful
I've been where u are so if I may, let me offer some advice for you to consider.  Before I do though let me say you look amazing and clearly you know how to put together a look.   However, it might be simply too good for what you're tying to accomplish.

There was a time when I was getting ""clocked"" often and couldn't figure out why.  Then it hit me......I was overdressed for where I was going and the hair was just too perfect which kept me from blending in.   Where I live, women will go to the mall in the most casual clothes they own.   As soon as I stopped dressing to look ""great"" and dumbed it down with jeans or a skirt just above the knee, a t-shirt with tennis shoes and putting my hair up under a baseball cap I found my way.  I learned that a successful trip to the mall (or anywhere else for that matter) was NOT drawing attention to myself by looking dressed up with an awesome hair style.  

Women don't care about what other women look like if they're wearing the most basic stuff to go out in public and very little makeup, but as soon as you dress it up, do your hair perfectly and look amazing......they're ready to inspect every little thing about you and judge you.  

You're a very passable girl.......hang in there.  It may feel tough right now but I'm cheering for you and I believe you'll figure this stuff out.
Fr!! I'm trans and I have a horrible habit of trying to pick out other trans people in crowds cause I was raised conservative and my parents would always do it.  But honestly I wouldn't even take a second look at you honey!  You look gorgeous (‚Å†¬†‚Å†‚ïπ‚Å†‚ñΩ‚Å†‚ïπ‚Å†¬†‚Å†).  I hope that makes you feel a bit better.
They do it on purpose because they don‚Äôt want to validate our existence
I think someone is just fishing for compliments with this post.
It's the hands. There's no surgery to change hand size and length of the fingers.
My mom tells me I need only hairline and that‚Äôs it but I know that I need to get forehead nose and chin done. My mom would say do you want to look notched like that tv shows. I have saved up a lot for surgery but I‚Äôm torn between two halves ma I get treat like crap in public  with people talking about me and sometime I get it wrong accusing people for talking about me but I‚Äôm on edge of my seat. I wish I had never ask those staff me ever if they were laughing about me because they probably weren‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm just not used to people.

I feel as though surgery would help me substantially. 

I was told by grandad to do walking lessons and voice then do surgery if you want to but would not even be supportive about it. 

I‚Äôm stuck. 

I just want honesty.
I‚Äôm trying to not be rude. That‚Äôs why I only ask if they were laughing at me or talking about me. I don‚Äôt want to stoop to their level.
Definitely looking into voice training but I don‚Äôt know if it actually works. I‚Äôm also going to buy those Hera breast forms so I can feel more comfortable and prepared for the surgery (FFS surgery). I was told that I need to practice my walk or do ballet classes.
Most of the time when I walk past young adults. People who have gone to the beach and the trouble makers who act foolish. And rich folks would make fun of me. Or people who look better than me. I saw a couple kissing on the tram standing and kissing each other right next to me as if they want me to notice them. Eshays who would try to be edgy and say mean things behind my back. Junkies and homeless druggies would perv at me and I feel like crap because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm only attractive to junkies smh. It‚Äôs horrible.
Thank you üôè
I‚Äôll try but it‚Äôs not easy.
Could it be my male gaze?
Was in the city
Thank you
As a kid your conservative parents would always try and pick out trans people in public crowds. Around what decade was this, seems unbelievable.
[deleted]
Yes because you're the only human who doesn't crave validation. How enlightened of you.
Not being a jerk costs zero dollars my dude
I‚Äôd start with not going to unqualified cis people for advice. People are saying voice training, that‚Äôs an absolutely massive factor there‚Äôs no other way around it. 

Past that, I can only say what I relate to. I‚Äôm pretty tall relative to female height especially outside of Europe, and have had to figure out what clothing works well on my silhouette, which seemingly overlaps with yours a fair bit. And this might sound pretty abstract but trying to phrase this type of stuff with just text is difficult.

You‚Äôre a big woman from the looks for the first few photos, but wearing little woman clothing. The cardigan and bag and to a lesser extent shirt in the photos are little woman clothing. They kinda shrink physique, which looks cute on smaller girls but once you‚Äôre tall enough broad enough whatever it just looks off. Same with how the shirt is cropped, if we can‚Äôt see the edges of the collar here and the cardigan is what‚Äôs doing that it‚Äôs actually making you look *more* broad believe it or not. And in your case the hairstyle while dope is also loud, so your legs and shoes look fine (black boots and leggings work with all physiques and silhouettes), hair and face presentation looks cool, model height, but then the mall girl torso clothing throws it off. If you had an oversized *and thicker cut fabric* maybe brown sweater, and a bag that looks louder/more distinct and has a thicker strap (this part about the strap is a really big deal. That thinner strap size is literally relative to look good on smaller girls), the fit is totally cohesive now. Past this, I‚Äôm just some internet rando who made one comment, I‚Äôd go to fashionable girlfriends you have (ideally tall girls) and see what sort of advice and brutally honest feedback they have to give on outfits

Tbh I don‚Äôt think the fashion aspect is really necessary if one has a passing voice, but think it‚Äôs worth mentioning. And if those pieces you‚Äôre wearing make you happy then fuck what I say, none of this is taking into account the personal feelings of the individual, which is the most important thing in personal style and fashion
Going to be 100% honest, I can't see how you'd get clocked by looks alone. How does your voice sound? Personally Ive seen ultra passing trans women who I can clock as MTF because their voice still has a masculine tone to it. I have not heard your voice, and I'm not going to judge that, just that's the only thing I can think of. Like, if passed by you irl, my first instinct is that you're just another woman, can't really tell you were amab.
Well then honestly, you're mum's a bit of a bitch. I understand the desire to pass, duh lol. Surgery isn't a cure all. Trans people will still be clocked after FFS, BA etc. It's important that decisions to change our bodies in such ways are made because it's something we want for ourselves, to make us more comfortable in our own skin, not for the benefit of others, not to try and blend in. That might be a factor, but it should be secondary. 

Idk wtf walking lessons is lol. Do men and women walk a particular way? That just sounds like a person would end up walking in an exaggerated female fashion that comes off look very fake. Voice training is obviously a long process that takes commitment, time and effort to pay off but does help people pass.

I also understand what you mean about being very sensitive to people around you. As someone who does not pass, I have a hair trigger for that sort of thing, especially because I work in a very public setting around dozens of people. It's not a healthy mindset to be in. I try to cope by telling myself that what's important is that I'm happy in my own skin.

For what it's worth, I think you're gorgeous. It's so easy to get in our heads and have a dysphoria spiral. When people tell you you're pretty, listen to them because they're not just saying it to make you feel better x
You are a much better person than I am. I personally will always be Ryde to rude people. I have a thick skin and they don't bother me really. I just make them feel how they tried to make me feel. Taste of their own medicine.
There is an entire profession that is devoted to changing your voice. It works. Find a good speech pathologist and you‚Äôll be golden. Mine specialized in trans voices and he helped tremendously.
Voice therapy is definitely cheaper than voice surgery. I didn‚Äôt really get oh with therapy so I had voice surgery which is on my profile. I‚Äôm now having post therapy which is somewhat helpful in stamina and raising my voice higher. I think they also do classes for women etiquette as well as trans women.
No problem girl we gotta have each others backs out here üíú
Life is about ups and downs the best times in life require self-determination and effort.  Learned along the way to adapt to changes in personal vital needs
You underestimate how shit people can be.  My dad calls them ""chicks with dicks"" and says their destroying America.  He still does it but I remember him starting around 2014 when trans and gay people were in the media more.  In the town I grew up in there was a guy who drove a box truck with racist and homophobic slurs written on the side, most of them followed by ""your going to burn in hell"". That guy was friends with the police, and he parked his truck in the middle of town all the fucking time, no one ever stopped him.  America is still quite homophobic and transphobic in some places.  I'm barely 2 decades old and I've been called the f slur many times by people my age.
I mean I have a family member that isn‚Äôt conservative, is gay and pagan and not too long ago they were in a call with a friend and started talking about how they don‚Äôt get, ‚Äúthey/them pronouns‚Äù and started making transphobic jokes. Even said something about ‚Äútheybies‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure what it was bc eventually I had to put in my earbuds bc I knew if I confronted them about it I‚Äôd accidentally out myself soooo

Plus they were being so loud I could barely hear my video and that‚Äôs was just as nerve wracking considering I was in the opposite room.

Plus they‚Äôve said on multiple occasions in not so many details about how trans ppl are going against the gods bc the gods gave them that gender for a reason. So yea some ppl are just fucking assholes. Makes it even worse is that they were born around the time Stonewall happened.
Transphobes don‚Äôt make sense. They just hate
Not to take away from op's frustration -- I wish I looked that good -- but proportions of things like straps, accessories, even cuffs and collar width is crucial.  Plus size has the same problem though there's more choices than used to be.  In my 20s being trans was overwhelming but (considering the other things I have made time for since)  I wish I had learned to sew and design my own clothes.
I sound like a guy or butch lesbian. It‚Äôs creating discomfort when I‚Äôm in work situations too. I feel out of place and draggy. Shudders. Is it too late to train my voice?
I used to think this way same as you but it will only make me feel like crap because it‚Äôs not who I am. 

It doesn‚Äôt stop people from thinking that we‚Äôre crazies in the street and are equivalent to junkies.

Man if only Jim Crow (or creator of) were real person he would only be the person I would yell at. Tomato juice and all lol.
I‚Äôm prioritising ffs surgery because I thought that I need a bit if work done. Then later on my boobs so I can replace the breast forms (i want 38C). Do you know any surgeon who could produce natural result that doesn‚Äôt look fake (for ffs surgery)? Anyone have ideas?
Love me some down votes for trying to help lol
As a person from the south I can confirm shit like that happens here.
It's never too late to start voice training. I won't tell you it's easy though. It's a learned skill, kinda like playing an instrument. Personally I have been voice training for roughly 5mo, and while I know my voice still can sound fairly masculine (especially when I forget to use it), but I can clearly tell a difference between how I used to sound vs how I sound now. 

There's an app called voice tools that helped me track this greatly. It will show your tone, pitch (and whether it's male/female or androgynous range), and also a little story you can read, which will then show you what % was more masc to fem. Seeing fem overtake masc overtime is highly euphoric. Additionally, videos on YouTube (a popular one is trans voice lessons) can help a ton. It won't be instantaneous, but you will see progress as long as you keep at it!

Finally, you are absolutely stunning hun! I couldn't even dream if being as beautiful as you are. And if people talk and have opinions, that's all they are. In the grand scheme of things, thier opinions shouldn't hold any weight on your happiness of being a woman (I know it's *super* difficult to basically stop caring what others think, but if you can get past that hurdle, or even work your way towards it will help immensely)

I wish you all the best hun! Hopefully you managed to pull *something* useful from this üòÅüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüíú
It's never too late. There's tons of voice training online that you can practice with, or if you have the money you can try seeing a vocal coach. You don't need to have the most perfectly feminine voice but voice training does help with passing.
I'm a veteran so I am probably much less inclined to deal with idiots than the average person. The military gave me a thick skin and the ability to shut down stupidity as quickly as possible. I hit em back quick with their own bs and keep moving. It's the same thing I do with other crazies. Tell me the moon landing was fake and I tell em the are a sheep for thinking yhe moon is real, tell me a second gunman killed JFK and I tell em JFK was a lizard man from Mars. Earth is flat, lol its all a simulation. Misgender me I misgender em back. 

Always gotta throw them off to shut it down.
If you want to consider ffs r/Transgender_Surgeries has a lot of discussion and a wiki.

Agree with the suggestion of ballet, it helped my daughter.  Other forms of dance (belly dance is usually very gender positive if you have a good studio in your area) probably good too.
Yeah you get it.  Living in the south as someone LGBT or a racial group that isn't white is quite the fucking experience.  Everyone wants to try and convert you to Christian, hurt you, or just be generally sarcastic towards you.  The best part is the questions, like ""are you one of them drags?"", ""Y'all can't be dressed like that theres children around"".  I love the south cause so many parts of it are beautiful and I want to die here but damn the people can really be awful.
I second voice tools(as well as the rest of this post. It's been useful if not cringey to hear myself back. I pass on the phone pretty much 100% of the time, in person around 80% voice wise, although I want my jaw and browline done. Other than that, I'll just say this, which I've said before on here: slay isn't just an appearance, it's your state of mind, the confidence to live as the human you are. There is so much time for you to get the little things done but YOU have to do it. It's a scary world for us out there, so we have to be fierce. My state government currently wants to crush us, so we have to be strong. There are people who would gladly cause great harm physically and emotionally to us, so we have to be willing to fight if necessary. But at the end of the day, we are who we are, and no one can take that from us.
Is voice training actually useful for anyone, or are there some cases where the surgery is required to reach the more feminine vocal range? Cuz I've just started and I can't possibly see how my voice will every sound feminine. I can't get higher pitch at all and my voice just cracks or whatever.
I mess around with voice tools, and I think it can be handy too how it can record a bit and you can play it right back, though it basically just does pitch, which is supposed to be pretty irrelevant versus resonance or whatever, only I don‚Äôt understand what those other things ARE, nor what to physically do to change them.
Don‚Äôt forget all the racial and sexual slurs we get called. That‚Äôs including the T-slur. 

And not to mention the ones that are always starting conversations like, ‚Äú I‚Äôm not racist but-‚Äú or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not homophobic but-‚Äú and it‚Äôs like yep imma stop you right there and remove myself from this conversation and do something that doesn‚Äôt require conversating with you üòÇ 

Even had instances where just cuz I‚Äôm white, racists, homophobes, transphobes, etc. will start spouting their bigotry and then I have to call em out.
A lot of us are changing this shit in the south and that‚Äôs why republicans are freaking out and passing these terrible anti-LGBT laws. They can‚Äôt stand that people are getting tired of their hate. It‚Äôs desperation. They are flexing hard while they still can.
Well I can't speak for everyone,but I would say I used to have a pretty masculine voice, and much like yourself, I didn't believe that I could reach a feminine range. While I'm sitting fairly low on the fem scale, I am now within the range *almost* naturally by this point. I've even shocked some coworkers lol
YukkoEX (on tiktok is where I saw this) shared a tip that helped me quite a bit. I can't remember exactly what was said, but to adjust resonance you basically want to reduce the space in your throat. They suggested to swallow, and pay attention to the feeling (more or less?) The more ""closed"" your throat is, the higher your resonance will be. This was easily the *hardest* part, because it's quite difficult to figure out how to do this. Even now I run into issues where my voice will legit just cut out while practicing this

Edit: found the video https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZMYbNqeBn/
Huh, maybe I can do it then. It's just idk how to control my voice. And I still need to get over the embarrassed feeling I get when practicing. It's stupid but I still feel it.
That‚Äôs interesting, thanks!

I‚Äôm super clueless with this, and obnoxiously I feel like even to the extent I feel I sound better or worse, it‚Äôs not consistent. 

Like I just tried to do what you described while running VoiceTools, so I could listen back to it, and then did it without doing that, and like I actually‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs anywhere near perfect but it‚Äôs not Vin Diesel sounding to me, but then, especially when I‚Äôm talking to my mom I hate how it sounds most of the time‚Ä¶ Although you with that, I guess not all the time.

I don‚Äôt know, I wish I could‚Äôve just avoided the damage that was done to me, I hate this. 

Right this very moment  I feel like I don‚Äôt sound very bad, but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and it may slip away at any moment, and I don‚Äôt even trust that it‚Äôs decent without being able to hear it back immediately. 

I really wish there was an app that would tell you what your residence was you could adjust and practice! 

At this point, I can‚Äôt even tell how masculine and sound even when I‚Äôm specifically trying. Like I know, is I dictate this it‚Äôs above the androgynous range in Voice Tools, that‚Äôs without even necessarily matters, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the worst thing ever, but‚Ä¶ Honestly, I think if I sounded like this all the time, but I looked pretty I would be fine, because there‚Äôs cis women who could pass for male from their voice, but then you SEE them
I have faith in you! There is definitely a learning curve, I won't deny that. But once you know how to control your resonance, it should move along petty quickly
Do you have any advice on how I can even begin?
I'm no professional, and as soon as I learned how to control resonance I kinda went off the road and did my own thing. That being said, I hear trans voice lessons on YouTube is a good place to learn, a lot of people seem to reccomend it"	129derh	trans	587	0.98	2023-04-02 07:13:21
It won‚Äôt stop with Texas	"I‚Äôm fucking terrified. I‚Äôve been thinking about this constantly since yesterday, and, as a lot of us may already have, I‚Äôve come to the horrifying realization that, with the way things are going, us trans folx here in the U.S will not be safe(ish) from state power for much longer. I mean I knew that this was the direction things were going but I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be this fast. I thought we‚Äôd have more time. They‚Äôve already successfully dehumanized us in the eyes of much of the general public, and now they‚Äôve used the state bureaucracy to equate being transgender with child abuse, which is the most direct way to dehumanize groups of people, and, if history‚Äôs taught us anything, is usually one of the last steps of that dehumanization process before state-sanctioned violence begins. Well, they‚Äôve now officially codified that part of the process, and since no one in a position of power to do so is doing anything in an organized manner to stop it, it won‚Äôt stop with Texas. And if someone who wants us dead even half as much as Greg Abbott does wins the presidency in 2024? I‚Äôm sure you can guess where things go next. And for those of you who still believe they‚Äôre our allies, that includes many of the Democratic candidates that the DNC would allow to have the nomination. They may not say it out loud but they will do nothing to stop it. Of course, our friends in Texas and Ukraine need immediate help, and focusing on them is still priority #1. But I felt the need to share this thought because I‚Äôm fucking terrified that myself and many of us here will likely need to leave the country within the next few years. Or go into hiding. Or fight to survive. I hope I‚Äôm wrong. I really hope I‚Äôm wrong. And to all of our friends in Texas and in Ukraine who need to leave their homes immediately, I‚Äôm sorry this is happening and I‚Äôm sorry that I don‚Äôt have anything of my own to offer you right now because I wish I could do more than my current situation allows, and I generally don‚Äôt pray, but I pray all of you make it out safe. 

They say those who don‚Äôt know history are doomed to repeat it. And that‚Äôs true. But right now, there are powerful people who *absolutely know history*, and are currently doing everything in their power to repeat it."	"I see it a bit differently. We are at a critical point in the debate. According to this [PBS article](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/new-poll-shows-americans-overwhelmingly-oppose-anti-transgender-laws) from last April, people like Shitface McGovernorson of Texas are on the *losing* side. 

They are getting desperate. Their desperation is making them take off whatever mask of politeness they had worn before.

We are in the middle of a major cultural shift. Those are never easy. They are always painful, especially for those who are beginning to gain their rightful place in society through that shift. 

Get organized, find ways to support our siblings in Texas, support organizations that support them.  Retaliation like Shitface's is to be expected, and it is just that --- retaliation. We can --- and I believe we will --- push through this. 

History will condemn him and his ilk.
If more states follow suit I genuinely could see a civil war of sorts happen, it'll really come down to if the cis people care enough...The states that support lgbtq people seem like they are pretty firm on that stance and the ones that don't support us seem to hate us. Like everything in America, we are very polarized. But we don't literally fight because it's not worth it, there just isn't enough tangible damages. But with this people are going to die or mass exodus out of these states. I still doubt it'll be enough since economics aren't coming into play, but God is it stupid, and I pray for change every day
get armed (legally and safely) and get organized.
the aclu has issued a statement saying that the letter is unconstitutional, and i'm sure there's at least one person willing to take this to the supreme court. not that it will help because the supreme court is currently loaded against us
Because I feel the need to add something positive to this incredibly depressing post, apparently chuck tingle bought the domain governorabbott.com to shit on him for this and even though I‚Äôm terrified and crying that makes my heart smile a little bit.
Utah...its already spreading sadly üòî
I agree, but there is hope from my perspective. 

We are at a critical turning point in our society (discussing the US right now, things differ depending on location) in more ways than one. For decades, the general public has experienced a general shift in attitude in so many ways, with LGBT issues being extremely prominent. In the 90s, Ellen Degeneres‚Äô mere coming out was scandalous and controversial. But now many live freely as their true selves with support from their families. 

Am I saying, ‚Äúhey, let‚Äôs all take a chill pill, there ain‚Äôt no need to worry!‚Äù Absolutely not. The attack on our rights by the state is very worrying and we have to fight back or *they will win*. But the good news is a fight we can win. And with the proliferation of LGBT+ acceptance within just the last 20 years, *we will fucking win and force these backward fucks out of power* 

And please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm dismissing the struggles many of you have to face. Trans rights especially are abysmal in the US and many of us are still unjustifiably treated like shit. For those in a tough position or surrounded by bigots, I‚Äôm so sorry and I‚Äôm sending my love.
This is super scary
the texas bill is quite controversial, but also moderates won‚Äôt stand for trans adults (i hope) being targeted. 
while i hate the bill and the notion that a transgender youth being accepted is abusive, it finds its basis in the parental control given in Texas and other states. 
what i find ironic about the bill, is that means trans kids in unaccepting homes have no legal protection against abuse(s)
This crap is why I‚Äôm in Hawaii. Course the buggers are welcome to try and come after me, they‚Äôll be in for a serious shock if they think because I‚Äôm trans I‚Äôm helpless. Kitty has claws.
Im not planning on coming out soon. I live in the south and it was already unsafe but now its just gotten worse. Im going to try and get myself a good reputation legally. (No criminal record, Good grades) and hightail it to Canada as fast as i can. Im going to try to get an exchange student program, even temporarily elsewhere is better than staying here rn. Also it might be easier to get citizenship with a record of going to canada for schooling.
I'm really scared
So there‚Äôs a bit of misinformation going around about what this letter means. Abbott wrote an executive order that child protective services needs to specifically investigate the parents of trans kids for child abuse, based on an opinion letter from the texas attorney general (Ken Paxton) that interprets providing gender affirming medical care as child abuse. Standard medical care for minors, like hormone blockers and HRT, are called our specifically, along with procedures already illegal for minors to have, mainly SRS. Paxton uses tons of misinformation about gender affirming care to support his position. It doesn‚Äôt change any law, but it asks that you interpret the law a certain way, targeted specifically at the families of trans kids, along with recommending any teachers, care givers, or other adults who are aware of the trans child‚Äôs care to be complicit in child abuse, under the law, and be charged along with parents. I just wanted to provide clarity where I can since misinterpretation can be twisted against the community and I‚Äôm a Texan. At this point, not by choice though.
I‚Äôm so pissed about this bullshit happening in Texas. It‚Äôs blatantly unconstitutional, and it‚Äôs not a law. It‚Äôs a letter. They don‚Äôt have to go through with it. I‚Äôm positive that there will people who don‚Äôt go through with it, because they know that supporting your damn child is not abuse. Mandatory reporters won‚Äôt report, the agents sent to investigate won‚Äôt actually take the kid away. I‚Äôm normally not one to hope for the best when it comes to people, but damnit things like this need that hope. I‚Äôm not a praying person, though I am a little religious, but damnit my prayers are going out to Ukraine, Texas, and Florida. Obviously, some of those places have problems that are worse than others, but they all suck and are hurting people. All we can do is hope for the best, and pray. I‚Äôm with you in the anger and fear though. I don‚Äôt want to go out of state anymore, really. (Luckily, I live in California, so I‚Äôm not worried about anything anti-LGBTQ+ actually happening governmentally.) Trust me, there are safe places, my friend. Not everywhere will turn into a blazing dumpster fire of human rights like Texas.
It‚Äôs time for a protest on Texas. This shithole has run rampant for too long!
The texas order was illegal and should be revoked. No legal legs to stand on
I live in Texas as well, I looked into this as a trans FTM child (my parents don't accept it, and I'm scared they might kick me out soon), at first one of my friends told me this was a good thing and I was excited, until I looked into it more, and started to freak out. And yeah, you're right.

Edit: Other people are right here, and we should all stay safe and hope for the best.
I'm escaping to canada and so should all of you

General Quarters. General Quarters. All hands man your battle stations.
This makes me so scared, im only 15 theres not a damn thing I can do about it.


Im not disagreeing, but this is NOT what my anxiety needed
It's not worth tripping about. Resistance to what is right always happens and it always passes eventually.
Right now michigan is safe. Its not the best place to live but its safe than most. If anyone looking to leave this is one suggestion
As much as this guy is a total piece of garbage for instituting this order or whatever the hell it is, I can't help believe that it's a total publicity stunt in the face of a midterm election to rile up their base and get the vote out.

It's horrible and despicable and possibly one of the grossest things I've ever seen a politician do, but I think they already know there's no chance of it actually going through, it's all just hot air.

With these politicians don't realize though is the pot doesn't settle once it's stirred, all of this rhetoric for votes and they're changing the course of society and the way that we interact with each other. Hate is a brand for them and that has devastating consequences across all sectors of society.

Edit: wanted to add that I hate Texas but I will go there to protect people if we need to. If there is any real force behind this, it has to be squashed quick.
I know someone who‚Äôs kinda an insider on the Texas stuff. He reassured me that there‚Äôs ‚Äúabsolutely no way it goes through‚Äù. Even so, I‚Äôm worried. I‚Äôm set to start HRT in only a few weeks.
Panicking, doomed, and destined for political suicide. This is the result, a dying beasts death throes
I current live in Ohio, a state that only allowed birth certificate change in 2020, I rushed to finish my documentation changes for the very reason of a domino effect of transphobia.
Unfortunately I‚Äôm a trans minor stuck in Texas, but I hope that in a few years I can move out of state. And hopefully after I get enough money I can move to Canada because that‚Äôs where I‚Äôve wanted to live and I‚Äôll be safer there hopefully. Sending all my love to my fellow Texans and to the people in Ukraine‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I agree sorta. I think it‚Äôs going to get really really bad in red & purple states in the short term while marginally better in blue states. The only issue being I think the short term is going to be like a decade as in a short amount of time in the grand scheme of history but an eternity for people living through it.
We may push through it; but how many of our sisters, brothers and non-binary people will die in the systematic stamping out of our existences?
I think I agree with this take. Fascists get like this when they realize they're losing battles. You don't have to push this kind of legislation when the rest of civil society is ALREADY ostracizing trans people and declining them affirming care. It's only now that everyone is moving on from their bullshit that they feel the need to shift to explicit violence. But short term this is gonna SUCK hardcore for the people directly affected. My heart goes out to all my trans siblings in Texas... and tbh everyone in Texas, that place just fucking sucks in general.
115 bills in 30 state legislatures does not sound like the losing side to me. And it‚Äôs not the American people I‚Äôm afraid of. It‚Äôs the state. 2/3rds of American people are against anti-transgender laws yet the lawmakers who write and propose and pass these bills keep getting elected to public office. We do not live in a functional democracy and thus the will of the American people does not hold much sway over the letter of the law. And when the law itself and their enforcers come for us, many of those people who are against anti-transgender laws will likely look the other way because their lives aren‚Äôt directly affected and they aren‚Äôt willing to risk their lives to help. I‚Äôm not saying not to have hope. Please find hope in whatever you can. However, I‚Äôm writing this out because I believe that treating the current situation any less seriously than it is is dangerous.
Hey I'll be helping with peaceful protests I'm right here in the heart of Texas eyyyyyyyy
I think this and hope for it too.
Noting that I live in a blue state so my stake in this is arguably lesser, I don't want to experience history, though I do want to reap the benefits of history.
I want to believe there are enough cis people here who care enough about our struggles to take up arms for our sake to stand a fighting chance against the U.S military. But I don‚Äôt. Lawmakers who are not transgender themselves or absolutely committed to making the lives of marginalized people better whatever the cost are going to ‚Äúreach across the aisle‚Äù and compromise with the people who want us dead. Their voter bases will continue voting for them because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre the lesser of two evils‚Äù, and all while life here becomes more and more intolerable for us. I don‚Äôt mean to be fatalistic. There‚Äôs hope. It‚Äôs just that our hope now lies in one of two places: with small and scattered leftist organizations throughout the country that *currently have too much infighting to do anything more than provide short-term mutual aid; and outside the United States. I am hoping that when things get bad enough those organizations will find unity of purpose and organize on a national scale. But I‚Äôve been a part of many such organizations in the past and I‚Äôm having a hard time believing in that enough to count on it.
its not about if a civil war happens , its about when it happens . like you said , our existence is extremely polarized , and the states that do support trans people are going to stand their ground firmly , while the states that decide that trans people are not allowed to live are also going to stand their own ground . with the legislation thats being passed combined with the cultural changes that are taking place a civil war is upon us , no doubts about it . the scary part {other than the war part of course} is the very real possibility that transphobia will win out in the end and trans people in the u.s. will be under even more threat . in that scenario , a lot of the world would probably follow suit due to the u.s' political dominance .
At least getting armed is easy in Texas
This is great advice and I would also encourage anyone who can to do so. However, I personally cannot legally arm myself or safely organize at the moment, and I know many of us share those hindrances. So if things go pear-shaped before I‚Äôm in a position to do so again, I‚Äôm gone.
""Legally?"" The law is the very problem with this situation.
I am armed, though I live in a blue state, and I carry *everywhere*.  I've been attacked enough times that I'm done being random assholes' punching bag.
Iowa has a renewed interest in this too.
I can only hope you‚Äôre right. If this is a fight I can see any shred of hope for us winning I will fight. But considering that the opponent is the wealthiest and most militarily powerful nation state in human history, it looks bleak ngl. Naturally I‚Äôll hold out whatever hope I can until the time comes to either fight or to flee, and we‚Äôll see then.
I very much disagree with your characterization of the bill as ‚Äúquite controversial‚Äù because, while not technically wrong, I believe describing it as that shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the danger that bill represents to the lives of millions. That is not just ‚Äúquite controversial‚Äù. That danger is an existential threat. 

And the moderates have done nothing so far except sacrifice the rights of marginalized communities at the alter of bipartisanship. I will not put my faith in them.
I love your fire. Whatever you do be safe ‚ù§Ô∏è
Whatever you can do to survive and be happy, please do it. And please be safe. I live near the Canadian border and if I don‚Äôt have time to organize to fight or plan where I‚Äôm going to go Canada will be the move.
Hey man, I get it. If you want, I can help you move to a safe state. I‚Äôm a career coach.
He *isn't* just encouraging a specific interpretation of the law. He is specifically directing executive organizations (DFPS) to do specific things (investigate and take action against the parents of trans kids), and he has the authority to compel them to do so. This *is* law.
Ok, so they haven‚Äôt changed the letter of the law yet. But it sounds like they‚Äôre gearing up to do so, and an executive order stating as much is just as terrifying. Thank you so much for clarifying, I read the letter itself and it stated the attorney generals office would begin investigating and prosecuting parents of trans kids and assumed they had to have first created a legal basis for doing so. Can you share a source so I can also share that information?
They don‚Äôt have to go through with it and I hope they don‚Äôt ofc. I‚Äôm too jaded to believe they won‚Äôt actually change the letter of the law considering the governor and the attorney generals office are on the same page about this. And once they change the letter of the law the machinations of the state start to move and peoples lives get ruined or taken from them.
I‚Äôm so sorry. I flaired this post with tw cuz I also have extreme anxiety and I knew this would probably trigger lots of peoples anxiety. I felt it needed to be said though. But still. I‚Äôm sorry. We‚Äôll get through this. I know this seems bleak and tbh it is but regardless we‚Äôll make it through cuz we have to live and we deserve to be happy.
Yea you‚Äôre right it always passes eventually. But more often than not it kills lots of people before it does. And this time around I‚Äôm one of the people it could kill. So I will trip as much as I see fit to thanks. At least until such a time when my survival becomes a more pressing matter than my fears.

If you want to leave Texas, please let me know. I‚Äôm working with a bunch of people to get anyone out who wants to leave before things get spicy.
Oh yeah, things are going to be shit in the short term. I live in Indiana, so I'm facing the same outlook. 

What I want to do, though, is avoid despair. We've come this far as a community. The torch has been passed to us. This is the trial we find ourselves in, just like the trials of those who came before. We cannot let ourselves lose hope --- and not some hope that *something* will miraculously happen, but a hope that inspires us to push forward.
Actually, I just thought of something.

Would it be possible to make a subreddit to memorialize those who've lost their lives due to transphobia? A place for friends and family to mourn and share their memories of lost loved ones. Sort of a place for virtual memorials and for emotional support for those who knew them. 

I sort of imagine a place where people can post stories, videos, and photos of their memories with lost trans loved ones, a place that prioritizes healing.

I've never moderated before, but I think such a place may help, at least for some people. I'd be willing to learn, if others thought it'd be a good idea.
It's horrible. 

We can't prevent every death. We should mourn every life lost to this cruelty. And every brother, sister, and sibling we lose should make us redouble our efforts to not lose another.

The goal is to minimize the damage and make it so that it never, *ever* happens again.
I live in Indiana. I'm not in a safe blue State. 

And I am not saying we do not take this seriously. That's emphatically not the kind of ""hope"" I'm talking about. What I mean is that without some hope and expectation of victory, we lose morale. If we lose morale, we lose the will to fight. And we *must* fight, probably for some time yet.

To be honest, I was expecting *more* bills. Some of them have already failed --- even in solidly red States with solidly red legislative branches. Many more are still unlikely to pass. Many hateful politicians still do fear public backlash, if it is big enough. So let's raise hell!

They are attempting this because they have heard the death knell of their hateful, colonopective ideology. They are desperate and brutish. 

I know that our democracy is an utter sham --- that it is the interests of the powerful that are represented. I know that rights must constantly be fought for --- that no rights except those belonging to the most powerful are ever guaranteed, because the forces of fear and hatred will always seek to chip away at them. 

No. We do not have much power. But we still have *some*. And others who have won difficult parts of their fight had less power and fewer resources than we have now. The question is: do we have the will, the pride, the wrath?

I will say, I want give credit to our allies. I know many of them who will not bend to transphobic laws that pass, who are as outraged as we are. Many are and will continue to fight with us. 

Instead of despair or worry or fear, I'm advocating for a prideful rage. 

Our community has come so far, has overcome so many obstacles. This is just another in our way. It too will fall.
I agree 100% with not being complacent because they are on the wrong side of history. Even if we will win longer term, our actions and inactions have great effects on when.

Here is why they are on the losing side. These laws are a reaction to progress. The attitudes and beliefs in these shitty acts were defacto a few years ago. They existed and were enforced strongly without the need to write a law about it. Only as we have made progress have they had the need to pass these laws. We saw the exact same thing with gay rights. We are in a parallel period that lead up to the passage of various DOMA (Defence of Marriage Act) type legislation. It was nearly a decade between the federal DOMA and Obergefell. It was a decade between those two events. SCOTUS is a lot more hostile to us now. BUT I fully expect with our continued education of peers and families and living as good human beings, we will get there. It is already later than it should be, but it is not too late to make things better.
I have a very simple idea for gaining political leverage and making those legislatures actually follow our will:

We change our registrations to Republican and start voting in their primaries. We start running leftwing candidates in Republican primaries. It will completely scramble the power dynamic that makes fascist candidates electorally viable.

When party coalitions become scrambled like that, it doesn‚Äôt take much to tip the balance of power even in really unrepresentative systems such as state legislatures with heavily gerrymandered districts.
I personally see the US as an oligargy more than a democracy as only rich white men seem to rule. Its very dissapointing
not necessarily, seek out organizations that can and do arm themselves, theres nothing wrong with needing protection outside of your personal ability to do so and orgs like Socialist Rifle Association and other left wing gun clubs/self-defense organizations can fill that role and probably will in a couple decades. also theres weaponry that can incapacitate an individual such as taser guns and similar stuff that extremely limited use for any other application, if that is viable for you
[removed]
i agree but advocating illegal things on the internet tends to bring attention that i personally do not want at this time
True, but remember, if a wide part of our culture accepts LGBT+ people (and more importantly, have loved ones a part of the community), the state will have a much, much harder time with its anti-LGBT rhetoric and actions
i certainly have no faith in moderates, don‚Äôt get me wrong. i would simply hope that those who claim to support individual liberty would not stoop to restricting the rights of adults. 
however with some research i‚Äôve found no court has ever convicted on the basis of the governors opinion. (it‚Äôs not a bill i assume? i was wrong.) however that‚Äôs where my faith comes in. not in moderates ethical basis, but in the legal system.. even a pretty transphobic state like VA has some nice places.

If you haven‚Äôt read it, here is Ken Paxton‚Äôs letter that Abbott used as a basis. Abbot isn‚Äôt the one interpretting it, it‚Äôs Paxton. Abbott is just a mouthpiece. 

https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/KP-0401.pdf

Paxton is Attorney General and the whole letter is outlining how and why gender affirming care should be interpreted as child abuse under the current laws. The information he uses is wrong and skewed, but his voice holds A LOT of power.
Here is Ken Paxton‚Äôs letter, which uses false claims and skewed medical information to make the claim of child abuse. It‚Äôs the basis for Abbott‚Äôs order. 

https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/KP-0401.pdf

Edit: Ken Paxton is the TX attorney general. He holds a lot of power over how laws are going to be applied and how people are charged. He‚Äôs a bigger threat. Abbott was just a mouthpiece.
If they change the law, someone will take these fuckers to the Supreme Court. They‚Äôre infringing on people‚Äôs right to exist. A truckload of human rights violation cases is headed their way.
Ok. Just don't let it kill you. Please.
It‚Äôs being challenged legally. But even so, I think that if it does go though, it won‚Äôt be enforced, especially in progressive ares.
I really like your thinking!!
That's actually a nice idea
I hope you‚Äôre right
I have stuff for self defense, but it won‚Äôt be enough against the state. And the SRA, while one of the larger armed left-wing orgs in the country, suffers from the same issues every leftist organization has since the beginning of leftism as a societal movement. I will consider joining them or one of the armed anarchist orgs I used to be involved with because I‚Äôll try anything before I have to leave my home and my loved ones again. But based on my past experience I can‚Äôt say I have much faith in the ability of those organizations to unify and organize well enough to stop what‚Äôs probably coming.
Just don't come to Aberta. Please don't, it's so bad over here.
I mean shit I‚Äôm already spitting distance from the border I might as well. I might even be able to convince some of my family to move with me. Probably not tho. I am concerned about Canada as a long term solution though only because it‚Äôs right there and even though Canada *does* have a somewhat less vitriolic state, it is still basically just a mining and gas company with a decent social safety net strapped to it and if the U.S starts classifying us as fugitives or worse, those of us who are still technically US citizens or even just not Canadian citizens likely won‚Äôt be safe there either. But that‚Äôs probably further down the line than having to leave the US would be so it‚Äôs at least a good temporary solution.
They had to have changed the definition of child abuse in a specific piece of legislation to include allowing minors to undergo any sort of medical transition. That‚Äôs the only way the attorney generals office could legally prosecute the parents for child abuse. If I‚Äôm wrong and they didn‚Äôt change the letter of the law, someone please tell me. Because I would love for this to just be more family-values posturing. 

I also hope that the people who have the power to do so will stop what‚Äôs coming rom happening but they‚Äôve thus far given me every reason to believe the won‚Äôt. 

But I understand your faith, and I would be a monster if I took that away from you. I only wish I could share it is all.
Yes, but Greg Abbott is the actual governor, who has directed an organization under his authority to take specific actions. That can and will be challenged, but until and unless the courts intervene (and that is far from guaranteed), he has the power to direct them like this. He didn't ""change laws,"" but that's not what governors do. His order is every bit as serious as it's being made out to be.
Let's not let Abbott off the hook.  Shitting on him is A-OK.
Thank you. I bookmarked it and will read it later.
You‚Äôre right they probably would get taken to the Supreme Court. And who does the Supreme Court currently consist of?
i probably completely agree with your criticisms of those organizations nor do i think they will be capable of stopping whats coming either. but its either use the most popular, mass-based means we have or put up no fight at all, so. but we also cannot predict what direction the downturn will take or its consequences, only educated guesses

I believe it was a posturing move. however, legal interpretation is as important as the law itself. like when we treat a law as outdated, we basically nullify it as a law.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not serious. But saying things like ‚Äúnew laws‚Äù or ‚Äúchanging laws‚Äù gives the GQP the chance to rebut by saying no, we‚Äôre just enforcing the laws we already have, and now they‚Äôre controlling the narrative. Ken Paxton got this ball rolling in the Texas government years ago, to the point that multiple republican candidates have made this a major platform. Much like Trump was a piece of shit floating in the bowl with other shit bumping him around, Texas is the same, just a different bowl.
No no, shit on him all you want. I just don‚Äôt want the sleight of hand letting Abbott take all the heat and Paxton walk away. Both are elected officials, so ousting one will not remove the other.
I realize that it‚Äôs a bunch of conservatives, but I also know that they have to listen to the constitution above all else, and wow is taking a child away from a healthy family for being who they are constitutional? Not one bit. Yes, they may be conservative as heck, but I‚Äôm gonna try and have some hope here. For humanity and the prospect of hurting children to be a bigger factor personally views. Personally, I‚Äôm hoping, because that‚Äôs all I can do besides get word around.
People get hate crimed and murdered for being trans, and it's very common. I can't come out publicly for fear of my saftey and people who have are treated awfully. It's really not good, which is why I'm getting out as soon as I can.
Those people do not believe the children are being taken away from a healthy family. They do not have to listen to anyone who says otherwise. They do not have to take their thoughts or feelings into account when making a decision. And they will almost certainly not. Nor will I bet my life, or anyone else‚Äôs for that matter, on the incredibly slim chance that they do.

Parent won't use my name until I prove I'm trans	"My parent is in town today because they want me to explain my gender experience. They've stated that they won't call me my name, James, until they understand better. Until then they are ""compromising"" by calling me J. It stings.
Of course I realize that this is very disrespectful. They don't trust my judgment enough to accept that I'm trans when I say so, even though I'm an adult. 
I'm not sure what I should do, if I should go along with their demands. It's demeaning, but I've never stood up to them about anything and am pretty desperate for their approval. It's kinda pathetic. I have no chance of winning over my other parent, so this feels like my one chance.
Besides, this parent has said some pretty not-cis things about their own experience with gender and don't want to alienate them if there's a chance I could help them grow and be happier by being patient here. 
If anybody has some advice, that would be great."	"I personally wouldn't entertain that at all. It's impossible to prove a feeling, your parent knows this. Even if you could I doubt it would be enough. 

I think I would go after the lack of trust and respect but I'd have to think about how to phrase it.
I'm gonna start off by saying I could very well be the wrong person to listen to. I've reached a point where if I can't be respected ill toss your ass in the fire and never look back. 

If it was me I wouldn't accept just 'j'. I would inform them if they can't give me the respect to call me my chosen name they can gtfo and visits over. Things should be on your terms, YOU'RE trans....YOU'RE the one turning your world upside down just to feel right. They're just along for the ride and if they can't do something as simple as call you by your name, that gives bad indications they'll have more gatekeeping moments that I personally wouldn't tolerate anyway. 

There is no proof your trans.....saying you are I guess? But seriously you don't owe them anything and I'd let them know that in no uncertain terms. You're trans because you say you are and they can accept that and respect you or they can pack up and go home until they can. 

Again....I may be the wrong person to listen to here. 1 person in my family hasn't disowned me and I really don't give a shit anymore. I gave them chances and they made it about them so I kicked them out of my life. Keep this in mind before you follow my words. On the upside, I have plenty of friends and my sister supportive af. 

This is your transition....not theirs. It's your decision....its your say. My opinion says quite strongly don't let them make this about them, or manipulate you into agreeing with whatever they want. This is a volatile path though, but the way to true freedom in my opinion. You'll have to fight for it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Just question everything they do. Literally everything. Then tell them you don‚Äôt understand, because you can‚Äôt personally relate, and that you don‚Äôt respect them enough to get past this.
""I'm trans. There, I proved it.""
I‚Äôm really sorry, dude. My wife and I both had to set down some boundaries with our parents around use of chosen name and pronouns. They‚Äôve been going for the linguistic hoops of‚Ä¶ just not using our names at all. 

Could you say something like, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt control your feelings about this, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to try anyway. I‚Äôm not asking you to fully understand or embrace this, but I am asking you to respect my gender identity by calling me James and using he/him pronouns and masculine terms for me.‚Äù The thing is‚Ä¶ trying to use the correct name and pronouns isn‚Äôt an extreme position to take. It‚Äôs the bare minimum. 

I hope it gets better for you soon dude!
I don't know what your situation is like. If you've moved out and have full control over your life, every time they don't use your name right just ghost em until they do. People who don't show you respect aren't worth keeping around so of they're not gonna go along with and respect what you want, don't show them respect either.
i dont understand how you prove such a thing. Do they want you to demonstrate a special dance or something?

Sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this - unsupportive parents are a bummer.
You don't need to prove anything to them. Maybe if she doesn't ever use your correct name (you don't have to ofc) you should put your foot down and tell them ""parent, I don't appreciate the way you are treating me. I shouldn't have to prove to you that I'm trans. I am trans, and you should respect that and respect me. And it would be nice if you would support me, and call me my correct name which is James""
There is no way to ""prove"" that you're trans. If you say you are, you are. From my admittedly limited perspective, your parent is being transphobic.
Ok.. have the prove thier your parents.  2 can play that stupid game..
First of all, you don‚Äôt have to explain yourself to anyone unless you really want to. Explaining yourself to someone who doesn‚Äôt or won‚Äôt understand will leave you questioning yourself and rethinking yourself and just leave you feeling awful about yourself. Trust me, I‚Äôve been though it before. 

You‚Äôre an adult, you don‚Äôt need approval from no one not even your parents. If they can‚Äôt see what an amazing person you are or accept/respect you for who you are then they aren‚Äôt worth it. That goes to anyone, not just your parents. You know who you are and no one should tell you otherwise. You are you and no one will change that. 

Don‚Äôt waste your breath trying to explain yourself to someone who won‚Äôt try to at least call you by your name because they don‚Äôt understand and want to learn more. That‚Äôs not fair to you. I know we all would like to have our parents in our life but if they don‚Äôt respect you for who you are then don‚Äôt even try because they aren‚Äôt trying. 

I‚Äôm sorry for my rant but I‚Äôve reached a point in my life that I have to put myself first and my well being first before anything. I‚Äôm done repressing myself and being something I‚Äôm not to make the people that I love and are supposed to love me for me happy and keeping myself locked away and unhappy. I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense but I hope you understand what I‚Äôm trying to say.
They don‚Äôt seem entirely unreasonable at least. Just lay out how you feel, how you‚Äôve felt. I don‚Äôt know your experience but I always felt like I was hiding behind an all-encompassing mask, patchworking armor to my soul to protect myself from everything. Nothing could bother me if I was just strong enough. Well, eventually you can‚Äôt get any stronger and dysphoria only gets worse with time - eventually crushing you. So I peeled away the armor, ripped off the mask - congratulations, it‚Äôs actually a girl!

You don‚Äôt have to stand up to them, if anything talk to them on equal footing. Being trans, especially pre-transition, is a unique maze to navigate and I would hope that they at least would understand that much. You can‚Äôt have all the answers, because nobody has them. I‚Äôm not sure how much this little rant will help, but I hope it can at least offer a little direction. Good luck <3

Edit: If all else fails tell them to prove what it feels like to be cis and watch them evaporate.
Start addressing them by there first name only back
Tell them it makes it harder to figure out when others don't use it/ don't try to see you as opposite gender which might could lead to you thinking that you're right for long enough that you won't accept the truth until it's too late (you're not always under 18)
You don't need to understand the nuances of someone's gender identity to understand that they know themselves better than anyone else, and to just respect them.
the sheer hubris of assuming that if they call you ‚ÄúJames‚Äù or not will effect anything about you üôÑ you‚Äôre James, whether they like it or not. they‚Äôre just being childish, trying to have some sort of control over that. sorry you have to deal with that, though. in my experience at least, a parent who won‚Äôt accept you ‚Äúuntil you‚Äôve explained yourself‚Äù won‚Äôt actually accept the explanation unless they already agree with it beforehand. yours might be better than that, but that‚Äôs been my experience.

advice: i ended up reaching a place with my parent where i just walk out the door any time they say something transphobic or misgender me. according to a friend who‚Äôs successfully handled an abusive parent, this strategy is the most successful way of getting a parent to change their behavior if they‚Äôre not willing to admit to any wrongdoing. haven‚Äôt been doing it long enough to see a difference, but i feel much better not having to deal with any of that.
Sounds like this is rooted in the traditionalistic ideal that ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a phase.‚Äù I hope they come around.
call their bluff by asking them to send you to a gender therapist to make sure. fly a pride flag at home. start wearing trans colored clothing whenever you see them. change your legal name to james. go on hormones. wear a nametag that says JAMES with your pronouns. rub their fucking faces in all of it and anytime they complain just grin and refuse to say anything except HI MY NAME IS JAMES
I personally think you'd be perfectly justified to not cooperate with them if they won't give you basic respect.

That said, it seems like you're interested in showing your parent kindness. And I really want you to understand that: you continuing to talk to them, try to ""explain your transness"", and whatever else, is an act of kindness in spite of their disrespect.

If you suspect your parent might be questioning, it's possible they are trying (in a terrible and rude way) to get you to explain yourself because they are curious and part of them wants to understand while another part of them still sees it as taboo.
You could say, ""if you want to understand my experience, step one is respecting my experience, and calling me by my preferred name is the simplest way to put respect into action"" and then let them know that's that...if they want to keep dead naming you, fine, but you also won't give them what they want if they do that.  Negotiate/turn the tabletops.
everyone should have the right to decide their own name. maybe ask them if theyd require a cis friend to jump through hoops before they respected their change in name. and point out thet the gendering of names is arbitrary anyway.
The reason why they wants you to prove it is because its impossible to prove so therefore they never have to use it
I don‚Äôt recommend letting them ‚Äòcompromise‚Äô. I came out 5 years ago and after a couple years of my mum continuing to call me by my deadname and getting aggressive and argumentative everytime I acknowledge my transness, she eventually said she‚Äôd call me by a nickname instead. She never calls me by my name (no matter how much I ask her to) unless in a professional setting. It‚Äôs basically a constant reminder that she‚Äôs disappointed in me and wishes I was different.
My dad‚Äôs girlfriend does that with me. Calls me J rather than my name that I‚Äôve been going by for 2-3 years, Jasper
I have been in the same situation for almost a year now, vying for parents approval when youre so desperate for it. I would say my advice to you is to say to them that you dont have time for them if they dont accept you for who you are. They can always come to you when they realize they value you and the relationship they have to you, but you cant go to them and initiate your own forgiveness. And you cant torture yourself hoping and praying that if you make the right concessions theyll learn to love you. You dont have to disown them, just dont give in to their transphobia, dont entertain them with your performance of gratitude. Just be honest with them and set boundaries. Its not your job to earn their love and respect for you as a person.
Ask them to prove that they are cis gendered. No, genitals don't count, as sex and gender are 2 different concepts. üôÑ
There's no way to prove it, you know yourself the best. I obviously don't know your parent but they will probably change their mind, and if not they're probably just being an asshole.
Honestly youre in better situation than iam, my mother told me that ""You have no girl inside of you"" two Times already she is also trying to convince me not to change my name to neutral  (Ashley) until i finish school after one year and half saying that I will ""hold on"", my dad on the other Hand is really nice person but  he doesnt call me Ashley eventhrough sexuologist told him to. And he keeps calling me ""man"" and ""boy"" and iam shy so I cant tell him that I want him to call me how I want him to call me.
Thank you! I'll think about how to explain that this is disrespectful.
I think it's a pretty simple situation to parallel. OP should ask their parent what their favorite color is. When parent answers, OP should just say ""prove it"". Parent will probably be confused at first and then left speechless.

People who ask these sorts of impossible questions aren't really thinking about what they're asking, sometimes rhetorical questions can help illustrate the nature of their request.
Thank you! It sucks that this is so common an experience. I'll just have to stand up for myself finally.
I love that. You ordered a burger for dinner? At a Mexican restaurant? I'm sorry but I don't understand and will not pay for the meal until I do
This is the way
Thank you! You're right, it is the bare minimum. I need to let them know that this is non-negotiable.
There comes a time in life when parents stop being your superiors and more your Equals. Realising that it means you can take charge of your own life and not take shit from them.
I do understand what you're trying to say, and I appreciate the rant. Using my name is not too much to ask from someone who claims to care about me.
In my experience, no one is gonna stick up for you but you. Even accepting and supportive friends aren't generally willing to stick their neck out to stand against transphobia. I'd learn to bite if you need to. 

I'll reiterate I'm probably bad to listen to. Also I'm sure others will disagree about their friends standing up for them but we all walk in our own shoes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
""You want a *burger*? Are you sure? Have you really thought about if you want a burger? I think you're just saying you want a burger because your friend ordered a burger. I just don't think you've really thought this through. You don't need a burger.""
That‚Äôs something I already do. Why even go to a Mexican restaurant if you‚Äôre gonna have a burger? I‚Äôve walked thru a casino in a dress with zero makeup pre everything, and I would be too embarrassed to order a burger at a Mexican restaurant.
This is the way.
For me, learning to assert boundaries with my parents over the years was HARD. If that‚Äôs true for you too‚Ä¶ I really recommend checking out Captain Awkward, because she is awesome at boundaries. She is also very trans friendly. [https://captainawkward.com/](https://captainawkward.com/)
I've moved out. The only thing they can control is access to my younger siblings, and only to a certain extent. They've already restricted my access to them before so I know they're willing to play that card.
You watch, by tomorrow it will be a hotdog they want.
‚ÄúYou only want a burger because Taco Bell made you shit a lot once‚Äù
Thank you! I suck at standing up for myself. I'll look at this.
It's a difficult situation. All j can say is your own happiness should come first before anything. It's sucks that they might restrict you from seeing your siblings tho.

Federal appeals court says Americans with Disabilities Act protections cover 'gender dysphoria,' handing a win to trans people		"Until the supremes overturn it‚Ä¶
This might be bad. It means they see being trans as a disability, and excludes trans people without dysphoria.
It will be important to see how this effects non-binary people, but it's a step in the right direction.
I know, they are going to set us back decades of progress.
There's no current basis for them to hear the case. The SCOTUS hears constitutional interpretations, not laws separate from the constitution.

That's one of the big reasons progressives are pushing for the codifying of RvW, because then it would be beyond the scope of SCOTUS.

Edit: That isn't to say they couldn't... Just that it isn't likely.
[The Supremes, overturning it.](https://imgur.com/a/gUftwFH)

In all seriousness, whether the supreme court gets involved or not, conservatives are going to try their hardest to fuck us over on this, as they do on every other issue.
I hate to be the killjoy, but I grew up with originalists and they're going to look at the text, which [actually says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12211)

> >!(1) transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments, or other sexual behavior disorders;!<

are explicitly not protected. In practice originalism seems to mean ""interpret the words of a law in the most bigoted and regressive way that can be historically hand-waved."" So we're not quite safe yet.

The good thing about *this* ruling is that it looks at the effectiveness of physical treatment and says ""well, there's the physical impairment, this case at *least* deserves to be heard.""
Maybe we shouldn't have a supreme court.
The ADA or this new inclusion of gender dysphoria?
I think you‚Äôre seeing disability in the wrong light. There‚Äôs nothing wrong or inherently negative about having a disability, under a lot of definitions things as simple as ADHD are considered disabilities. All it really means is there are certain compensations needed to give them an equal chance at life, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. It‚Äôs not something to be ‚Äúcured‚Äù.
Unfortunately, that argument could be used against us, yes.
Armchair interpretation (IANAL):

If your boss uses your correct name, you have no dysphoria in the moment and therefore no disability. So being trans is not a disabling factor.

Tomorrow the boss starts using your 'legally required' deadname or bathroom or outfit.
Now every time you encounter work you experience dysphoria, a potentially disabling condition(per DSM5).

From that we can argue that forcing bosses to use your correct gender identity is an ADA enforced protection.

Not all wheelchair users would say ""I am disabled"" but the ADA still functions for them as a guarantee of baseline social accommodation.

Someone fails at that accommodation, like knowingly using a deadname, we get to sue them for failing at basic citizenship.
Alright then, just tell the therapist or doctor or whoever that you have dysphoria. Whats the issue here?
I'm both shocked but also not at all surprised that all those ""sexual behaviour disorders"" are categorized in the same way.
Women unable to produce their own estrogen or give birth certainly sounds like a physical impairment to me; same for whatever the men are unable to do‚Ä¶ seems ridiculous to just limit it to intersex conditions or ‚Äúother sexual behavior disorders,‚Äù wtf is the latter?
Beeby does not believe they are saying disabilities are bad‚Äîthey are saying that not all trans people will be covered because not all trans people experience gender dysphoria. Also, usually, bigots view disabilities as something bad, Beeby thinks that is what they meant‚ÄîBeeby isn't them though, so not sure.
I am disabled. You don't need to talk down to me.
This language is using the DSM-4 (and earlier) language. With dsm-5 they recategorized gender dysphoria away from those, which are still classified under ""paraphilic"" disorders
And not categorized as ""these acts are criminal"" but phrased as ""these types are not worthy of our governments protection.""

the very existence of the section is bigotry.
The Party of Evil has hated the ADA for decades (how dare people with medical needs feel entitled to reasonable accommodation?) but they used to have a non-extremist right-wing, so that language was a concession between those people and the absolute goblins.
As am I, in a multitude of ways. It was not intended to be condescending, if that‚Äôs how you perceived it I apologize, I just wasn‚Äôt fond of the implications.
I'm glad they (kinda) fixed that but I still think it's shocking that somehow all of those where in the same category.

Happy Monday friend! üòä
Close game though
You are beautiful!
Cries in Packer fan üò≠
Falcons lost :(
Go birds! (I don‚Äôt follow football I‚Äôm mainly a hockey fan but I‚Äôve watched enough Always Sunny to know that when eagles are in conversation you always say Go Birds)
My team won too. I watch college and am an Alabama fan.
Omg! Just stopping in to say you‚Äôre really pretty! (You‚Äôre hair is so nice too?? I love the way you style it!)
*sad cowboys fan noises*
Honesty I might get into sport just because I heard people make like parties for events and watch the TV while a bunch of people are huddle together. Never been apart of it but it looks like fun.
This comment section is filled with football fans and I thought I was the only trans person who liked american football

Football season started yesterday and my favorite team won so today I‚Äôm happy ü•∞

I hate the world	so like I was walking back to my hotel room after winning a turtle burger and was about to get some ice cream and then these 2 transphobic boys pointed at me and went ‚Äòhaha trans‚Äô I looked at them and now I‚Äôm crying on a toilet. Yay.	"There‚Äôs so many POS in this world. But we can‚Äôt let the stupidity of the few discourage us and our happiness. They will have to live with the fact they let HATE belittle them. You are stronger, you have the power to be your true self and I know that if you are happy and out there, you are being the Happiness! Love yourself and the Journey! ‚ù§Ô∏è
""Haha, dipshits""
I would've just replied ""nice gender! Did your dad pick it out for you?""
I hate the world too. That's why I'm comfortable being trans. Because I don't give a fuck what the world thinks. It's full of stupid small minded people. Be happy so you can spite the world that spits in your face every day.
What's a turtle burger and how do you win one?
These people will one day remember moments like these. They won't remember exactly what they said. They'll remember very well how it made them feel, and how it might've made you feel. And then they'll feel the regret. It always happens. Whether soon, or late.
They were probably jealous, insecure little twats who WISH they have the confidence to be who they truly are. I‚Äôm sorry people are so cruel, I myself am not trans but I‚Äôm in this group because I have so much love for the trans community. I hope that‚Äôs ok! Adjust your crown babe, literally people hate because they‚Äôre miserable with themselves and have to project their shitty attitudes onto people.
I know it's easier said than done, but don't give these piles of human trash your energy. They'll never amount to anything and die in obscurity having might as well not existed, being solely thorns in others sides and nothing more.
I'm sorry üòî
I went to a Walmart today and got a few weird looks
""haha trans"" like yeah mate ?... What of it's so funny to ya ?...
me personally, i wouldn't have let that happen. personally, i'd've punched em
dealing with ignorance is, unfortunately, part of being open about who you are as a trans person. you should never let ignorance get in the way of being the who you are. for every transphobe you come across there is someone who loves and supports you, possibly even more so BECAUSE you have the courage to be yourself. it sucks that being you even has to be a courageous thing, but it is. you're stronger than you know!
Shoot a death glare back with ""haha idiot"" Or ""Oh look a talking asshole!"" Mocking their laughter like Jim Carrey - really mock it and telling them to piss off works too as well as wow look at that! There's um a huge dick on your head!
[deleted]
I ordered pizza the other day and the guy asked for my name and I told him, he laughed like it was a joke and said ""no really whats your name sir."" He called me miss untill I started ordering. I guess my voice gives it away. The place had like 8 men standing around and I just told him my dead name and left. I've never found my name to be weird or anything and I've never had anxiety about my name on but now I do. Now I'm goning to be worried the next person I give my name too is going to laugh at me..... I hate mem sometimes.

Btw my name is Stephanie and my dead name is just stevie....not that it matters
There's a lot of awful people but there's always good people out there. People who stoop to hate for no reason have deep rooted issues that they refuse to address. The best revenge is to live your best life and keep on being you.
I love to smile and be happy taking selfies and poses and I find it‚Äôs the people that are down and out that have the biggest problem x l love being a trans warrior
‚ÄúHaha cis‚Äù
There will always be ignorant and insensitive people don't let them have any power over you. Hold your head  up high and be proud of who you are. Together we can concur ignorance.
You are the better person though. I would feel the same if it happened to me, and am just happy that I have a small circle of trans friends. I felt the same way yesterday when a Facebook friend posted a trans phobic meme. It hit me hard because I had never pegged him to be one.
Please understand that I am completely sympathetic, and know your pain. One of the things that helped me is, I 100% accept that I am a trans woman. I am not and will never be a cis woman. So when someone feels the need to point it out, it doesn‚Äôt hurt as much. 

Hope it helps and remember, people are a-holes.
I‚Äôm sorry love :(
I'm sorry that happened. You don't deserve it.

&#x200B;

What's a turtle burger?
To be honest, in the meantime I‚Äôm quite proud for being trans/non-binary. I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I get looks from time to time, but then again, I think ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm something special, that‚Äôs why they look‚Ä¶‚Äù I know that some of us don‚Äôt want to be that ‚Äúspecial‚Äù, but for me it is kind of a badge-of-honor because I never fit in anywhere before anyway‚Ä¶
I hate to be tough, but reacting like this just gives them exactly what they want. Don't let some inhuman pieces of garbage get to you. Their opinion is nothing, and they are worth nothing. You are better than them and always will be.
UGH. I'm sorry. What I love about Reddit over any other platform is that you really can find your people and have these little moments with them to know you aren't alone in it all. As far as the douche bags, whenever I hear stories like this or experience something similar - I remember, I know these people. They're all the same. They go into public to be mean. To bully. They get some sort of thrill out of being aggressive and trying to humiliate others. They don't necessarily pick someone because that someone deserves to be picked on (in their mind). No. They actually would do this to ANYONE with a few small exceptions. In that way, they pick who they won't mess with. Everyone else is fair game. Then, what they do is, they just blurt out whatever they notice first. My BF in high school smoked and was from ""below the tracks,"" so they screamed ""burnout"" at her. Another was overweight so they yelled ""boom baba"" when she walked down the hall. They called me ""mosquito bites"" because my boobs were small. I went to a country in Latin America and I'm the only white-as-a-piece-of-paper person there, a group kept yelling ""La Blanca"" at me. It's four eyes or dirtball or whatever other word they can grab super-fast based on whatever they notice first. It's truly not a personal attack. They are the most uncreative, unintelligent lumps of actual crap on the face of the planet. If it happens to me I chuckle and remember that they have the brain capacity of a toddler who sees something and yells out the single word to mom. ""Tree!"" ""House!"" What they can't handle is any sort of in-depth response. They bank on shutting people down. Still... have to be super careful out there. People can get violent way too fast these days. I just smile and think, ""what a fuckin' moron,"" and walk away.
Thank you so much and no I‚Äôm not crying you are!
This. This exactly.
Just reply ""haha single"" and go about your day.

That's good!
This could get flipped around on us so hard it might backfire

So I‚Äôm at a hotel and there was an arcade and a crane machine and there was this turtle and instead of a shell it was a burger
You take a turtle


And then you love and cherish that turtle for the rest of your life. It will outlive you.
That was my question too! Yay turtle burger!!
Nah. Some scum remains scum. Best not to dwell on the opinions of strangers.
I admire the optimism.
But really most of these people will NEVER change. The ones who do are just a fraction.
Absolutely true projecting how they feel inside
Your fine it‚Äôs not your fault
I‚Äôm sorry ma‚Äôm/sir/xirs/mix/it
Ngl I would of but didn‚Äôt want security called and my grandma was right by me
(/lh)
That‚Äôs victim shaming speech. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not intentional but things like that have the potential to make people feel like they have done the wrong thing or they didn‚Äôt do enough. Which can make it hurt worse. And personally I think people WANT to see us do something like ‚Äúattack‚Äù someone so they can say ‚Äúsee I told you they are bad‚Äù. Because punching someone over words will NEVER work in your favor and the majority of people will not be on your side.
Your happiness is not a bother now smile you look much better when you do. Now enjoy your day/night and make the most of it!
So full of nincompoops, the world is. But at least there are some sensible folk out there too. Am I right,  Stephanie?
I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. Some people are absolute shit heads
A turtle but instead of a shell is a burger
I know you are but what am I! ‚ù§Ô∏è
How so?
I just cracked a few months ago, but I'm taking things in stride.

I got to the point where I don't care what others think because I look at the world around me, and it's absurd. There is so much fucked up shit happening in the world, and people decide to cause a fuss about someone's gender of all things? They over look warcrimes, poverty, an inherently exploitative system, and the collapse of the global ecosystem. And they instead decide to focus on the very important issue of... someone being a woman when they were born a man?

 These people don't deserve respect. They don't deserve to have their shitty transphobic opinions validated by being able to make you feel bad about who you are.
Well I only care about the opinion of people that I actually care about like friends and family. I don't get the thought process of caring about what random people think, especially when they are obviously dumb bigots. I don't care about what idiots like those think and I don't really understand why people do
That sounds adorable lol.
can i see a picture of it? ü•∫
Now I need one too
this took a turn for the best
My mom has several turtles. She recued two of them from the floor of the factory where she is a supervisor, they were covered in metal shavings and very dehydrated so she took them home. The others she got from a rescue.

It has been spoken upon and agreed that of my siblings, I will become the turtle keeper when she passes.
100%
Thank you for the support! I‚Äôm sorry too
Violence is never the right option unless you are protecting yourself from a physical attack. People WANT to see you do something ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù so they can say ‚Äúsee, I knew they were bad‚Äù. Don‚Äôt let people have that power over you.
i put a /lh tone indicator in the replies to note that it was a lighthearted comment lol and i dont think op took it as victim shaming based on their comment

Yes üíö
bless i am even more confused now. I hope it was good.
This may be personally, but i believe that some cis people would just brush it off, whereas if i were to get hit with that line, id crumble inside.

I got my transphobic/sexist boss fired and the company Christmas party was the most gender affirming night of my life (so far :P)	"I‚Äôm going to keep things pretty non-specific to protect everyone in this story. I work for a paint distributor in the US. It‚Äôs a rather large company with many stores in my particular district. I‚Äôm 24, MTF, and use they/them pronouns. However, as I am very very early in my transition, I only use my preferred pronouns with people I know really well as I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù anyone that wouldn‚Äôt assume I‚Äôm a trans woman by looking at me. Yes, I know, it kind of defeats the point of having preferred pronouns but it feels safer as I live in the Southern US.  I also have a physical disability that makes my work life a little more difficult at times.

The assistant manager at my store, we will just call him ‚ÄúN‚Äù, has never liked me. From my hire date until the date that he was no longer with the company, he spoke poorly of me to my coworkers and customers. He began keeping a hand-written and personal record of any health issues I would have. These were kept in a journal on his desk. However, this journal was leant out to my coworkers and even occasionally customers on a daily basis. It was used for to-do lists and order information as well as his previously stated notes on me. He kept the notebook from me specifically but wasn‚Äôt shy when showing it to my coworkers. That was strike 1. 

Strike 2 came when I found out that he often told my singular Cis-female coworker that she would ‚Äúmake a great little secretary‚Äù for him some day. When she told him about customers that were saying inappropriate things to her, he told her that she should be grateful. He also attempted to talk to her about his sex life to ‚Äúget a females opinion.‚Äù Overall, gross behavior. 

Strike 3 is the one that pertained to this particular sub and the one that hurt me the most and made me so unbelievably uncomfortable. After he was having a rough day, N told one of my coworkers that he was tired of seeing me paint my nails. My coworker deflected that by saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of sus that you are so uncomfortable about their nails.‚Äù (This coworker knows my pronouns but N didn‚Äôt know I was trans, or at least I thought) to this, N responded ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sus? How am I the one that‚Äôs sus when he wants to paint his nails and cut his f*****g nuts off?‚Äù My coworker defused the situation and called me to tell me what happened. 

One phone call to HR, two emails containing photo and audio evidence, and a three week wait and N was permanently removed from the company. 

I had to come out to my District Manager and the Regional HR representative to make this investigation really hold any weight. That was a huge step for me but they honored my preference in name and pronouns and helped me find justice. 

Fast forward to tonight. My partner and I attend the company Christmas party. It was at one of those big new-age driving ranges with food and drinks. As soon as I walk onto the platform to sign in, the DM sees me and approaches. He extends his hand and with a massive smile says ‚ÄúEden, I‚Äôm so glad you could make it.‚Äù He then introduces me to some of the corporate people from the district as well as his wife. During this, he is effortlessly using my name and pronouns. This is the first time that I have ever gotten to be somewhere as myself since coming out earlier this year. 

That‚Äôs my euphoria. Lots of wins for myself all while making my workplace safer for people like me."	"Congratulations Eden!
Stories like this make me feel like I can maybe be a little more out and proud in the South. Keep it up, Eden!
Good on you! üí™üèª
congrats Eden !
That's awesome...Merry Christmas and/or a wonderful \[holiday you celebrate here\]!
That right there is the power of just being you doesn‚Äôt really matter what anybody else thinks doesn‚Äôt really matter what anybody else feels in the end as a manager on a corporate level fuck with that at your own peril. HR Don‚Äôt fuck with libel and anyone who thinks that that kind of behavior isn‚Äôt libelous fucking stupid and should be removed good on ya girl yeah
Uhm, a huge thank you to your coworker standing up for you, and overall, well done to all of you involved! I hate that there was a person who was that toxic at your work, but I'm loving the fact that you all looked out for each other. I'm so happy you had a great Christmas party, Eden!
Good riddance to that asshole, and that party sounds *fantastic!* Love the name too
I know it‚Äôs not what I was supposed to get out of this but I just read N as Neville the squash the entire time. Now I feel bad for inserting him into such a crappy situation.
I'd have liked an earlier intervention and counseling and rehabilitation for them.
There was time.
Yes he was horrendous and in power etc.
But who knows what this person suffered and how they were brought up to be so prejudiced. 
""I got him fired and feel validated"" really feels like perpetuating the cycle.
What if they end it?
This makes me happy. Amazing coworker for standing up to you. Amazing Regional HR Rep and DM for doing what's right and getting with the changing times. Big thumbs down to the transphobic/sexist boss, hope he learns his lesson or dies trying.
A win for Eden, the trans community, and your workplace. Justice. I'm happy for you!
Ah yes.  
The classic ""Fuck around and find out"" of discrimination.

He refused to aknowledge your identity now his superiors refused to aknowledge his position in the company. Magnificently done, girl!
Not to sound vengeful, but may he enjoy his new life on the street. üòå
I'm crying a little bit I'm so happy for you!! üò¢ Congrats Eden! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíúüíô
Jfc a journal!?
It's crazy to me how we can be so non intrusive with our transitions and STILL be seen as a problem or something that causes discomfort. It's so infuriating. I'm glad your issue was resolved the correct way and with expediency. Congratulations!"	rneasc	trans	281	0.99	2021-12-24 04:46:45
School locker rooms	"My 13yo daughter is trans, in 7th grade. She's transitioned socially but due to cost, not medically. There's a trans girl in 9th grade in the same boat. They both came out last year but since only half the students were actually in class and they closed the locker rooms for social distancing reasons, no one did much more than grumble under their breath. This year, however, there are parent meetings going on about the trans kids in bathrooms and locker rooms. They're at the school board meetings demanding action.
A couple days ago I sat with 4 of the ""concerned mom's"" to try to educate them, or at least find out what their plans are. They said, ""We just want to make sure every child is comfortable in the locker room."" I called bullshit. I straight up said, ""No you don't. Kids have been uncomfortable in locker rooms forever. There are always kids who hate changing. And none of you gave a shit about ANY of them. Schools, parents, everyone, tells these kids all the time that they have no choice, they have to change, it's part of life, and their grade depends on it. The only reason you all care now is because you think they SHOULD be uncomfortable. That's where I take offense. You're perfectly fine forcing minor children to undress for grades, but not with my child existing in the room."" Well, they'd never thought of it that way before! These mom's, and a bunch of others who just didn't show up to lunch that day, told me they want to school to put partitions in the locker rooms so everyone will have privacy. Again, ""That won't work. It will give the kids privacy but the problem isn't the kids, it's you, and you have an issue with the bathroom and that already has separate stalls.""
Long story short, they agreed that an easier solution is to stop making kids undress for grades. It's a very small victory, but I count it as a win. And hopefully they'll be more open to talking about their next complaint. I hope so, because I have a whole big speech about how the first time a butterfly lands on a toddler they freak out but instead of trying to keep butterflies away from them forever, parents just explain that butterflies aren't dangerous, and maybe these parents could treat trans people the same way and explain that they're not a threat instead of indulging their kids' unrealistic fears."	"You speak the truth with eloquence and power. You're my new friend!
You rock! I'm saving this post for future reference.
Thank you!

Changing for gym in high school was absolutely terrifying.  I didn't know why at the time, but it just filled me with dread.  I used to wait until everyone else was done before I'd change.  This worked until they got a new gym teacher.  He screamed at me for ""wasting time"" when I desperately tried explaining how uncomfortable I was.  I started wearing my gym clothes under my regular clothes so I could change extremely quickly, and didn't have to expose my chest.

The gym teacher always put me on ""skins"" during basketball, which I absolutely refused to do.  I eventually quit changing all together after being pantsed.  The school administrators tried to blame me, and threatened me because the kid lied and said I spread a rumor about him.  That it was my fault.  They also asked embarrassing questions like ""Did *IT* fall out?"".  So, I quit changing after that.  I got a C in gym for not participating, and my dad screamed at me.  I was so happy that I never had to take gym again after that year.
This is fantastic. Thank you for speaking out. Your daughter is lucky to have you. 

I am curious though, and I apologize for not knowing more about tween/teen trans folks, but you say‚Äînot medically transitioned due to cost‚Äîdo you just mean hormone blockers? Can 13 year olds take HRT? I wish her and you the best of luck regardless.
I love this view of locker rooms (well,  I hate the truth of it, and as a trans person I hate locker rooms in general, but I love the fact that you put it so accurately)
Your a true legend
You are an amazing parent holy shit
Thats definitely a win.

I genuinely don't understand all this gender separation. Most swimming changing rooms I've been to are 1 big changing room with single stalls. 

Couple of gendered shower rooms and some bigger family stalls but that's it. So I get a choice where I go. Weirdly the gym changing rooms at the same place are gendered.

Why don't we just have single stalls everywhere?
Are they their kids‚Äô fears though? In my experience as a kid of very hateful people, any fears I had about gay or trans people (which I grew up to realize I AM on both counts) was given to me by my parents. I wouldn‚Äôt give these people an inch to shift blame to their kids, and I‚Äôd make sure to place and keep that blame for having fear of trans people squarely on their shoulders. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to go to bat on something that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue, but seriously congrats on the win! 

Also thank you for being so supportive of your kiddo <3
Butterflies and toddlers bit had me cackling over har.
I failed gym class every year just because I wouldn't change in front of a bunch of people that already bullied me. The fact that we have to get undressed in front of an adult and other students for grades has always been fucking weird and I will never understand why that's even necessary.
You‚Äôre an amazing parent standing up for your child‚Äôs rights. My 15 yr old son is transgender and i‚Äôve been worrying about her safety in the restrooms.  Her school‚Äôs solution is to allow her to use the bathroom in the nurses office. It‚Äôs a start anyway.  Thank God my child gets to use marching band for her pe credit and does not have to undress or i can imagine we‚Äôd be having the same issues you‚Äôve been dealing with.   Eventually i think they will take such things into consideration when building new schools.  At this time, our kids are just the ones who are breaking the mold.  Hang in there üòä
Well said!
What's wrong with having private changing stalls? Like you said tons of kids have issues changing in front of other people. Not having separate gym clothes is an issue unless it's the very last period of the day. No one wants to sit in a room full of sweaty teenagers.
This is a really good point.
Fully agree with everything here which is a fairly rare occasion. The thought of changing in front of people was fucking wild to me at 6th grade and I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing that being trans (I didn‚Äôt know till about a year ago and I‚Äôm a senior this year) they really should have stalls and have like some of the class go in and change in groups. It would also be greatly appreciated by victims of sa that are really against the idea of undressing around other people
Here, you flunk if you don't wear the uniform. I had 2 gym classes in 10th grade because I didn't change in 9th grade and had to make up the year.
I am sorry to hear you had such a horrible experience with all that nonsense.
She's not on puberty blockers or hrt. She's advanced, puberty wise, and would be a candidate for more than other girls her age might get. I don't know all the details because the one office visit we had cost us $300 out of pocket, with no labs at all.
The only reason I mentioned her transition at all is because there's this false belief that you can't be trans, or at least you can't live as your gender, unless there are medical intervention. To a lot of people, even school staff, my daughter and her friend are just boys in girl clothes until they get a prescription or a surgery.
I really think that if some organized people made a movement out of it, we could get PE uniform mandates eradicated all over. If you stress the pedo angle of it, and that's a real angle, and point out how counterproductive it is to all of the ways we try to teach our kids that they are in charge of who gets to see them undressed, I think it could go the way of teachers paddling students. And there's a great parallel to Chicago's naked swimming. Look it up, it's horrifying.
I completely üíØ percent agree!
It's only legal to force a roomo full of healthy, unrelated, minor childhood to undress against their will in 2 places: school and jail. Anywhere else, it would be a felony.
Son?
My daughter uses a gender neutral bathroom and changes in there. It had been the staff bathroom before this year but they changed it this year.  Last year they'd proposed the office bathroom but the secretary isn't very nice so she just went all day without peeing. The high school put in gender neutral bathrooms, too, which is what the other t girl uses and changes in. The trans kids aren't even using the locker rooms and these parents are angry because they don't even do enough research to know this. I had one of them ask me if there were hormone shots that could make my daughter feel like a boy again. Like, if there were a cute for trans don't you think that's what doctors would do?! And if it were a hormone thing there would be no postmenopausal women, just old men with boobs. These people will look up just enough to bring that Loudoun County rape case up but not enough to even find out what trans means.
They're nothing wrong with it if the money and space is there to put stalls in, and there's not. But the thing is, nobody showers after gym, and nobody tries to make the kids shower, and deodorant wasn't even on the school supply list. The parents I spoke to don't even send it to school with their kids. I have been washing gym clothes on the weekends fora collective 8 years and they've never stunk because the kids don't do anything sweaty now. They walk the track or play dodgeball or volleyball, things that don't involve running. And the bathrooms already have stalls exactly like the ones these parents think will make them happy, and they still have a problem with trans kids in the bathrooms so obviously stalls aren't going to solve their issues.
That last part is what put them on my side about it, I think. I had said that the locker room can be traumatic for any number of reasons, from early development to late development to body hair to scars or birthmarks, and one of the mom's said how horrible it had been for her to not only undress but to be told by an adult that she had no choice in the matter because she had been assaulted by an adult who told her she had no choice but to undress.
If you don't mind me asking, what state are you in? When I started transitioning a big part of what kept be back was the financial aspect of medical treatment, but I found out that there are often times clinics that do sliding scale fees for visits (I ended up paying $25 for each visit as a flat fee, labs included.) And I was able to use Good Rx to get coupons for the meds to bring them to a reasonable cost. I am now on medicaid (IL County Care) and they cover everything except the needles and syringes.
Absolutely, a person is transgender whether or not they medically transition. I just had no idea it was that expensive!  

I am very lucky to live in an informed consent state, and my insurance covers everything. 
I‚Äôm sorry to hear she doesn‚Äôt have access to those things (if she wants them) but she is lucky in that she has a supportive family! 

I didn‚Äôt begin HRT until I was 40 so I know it‚Äôs never too late.
My daughter is the same. No hormones or blockers, but presenting herself fairly comfortably at school this yes as a girl, especially with regard to her clothing choices.
It's so messed up.
I try üòÖ
Yes it‚Äôs going to take a lot if educating people. My husband was one who wondered if my daughter‚Äôs feelings could be changed with hormones, as well üòû
I‚Äôm surprised how sterile and uncaring school systems can be on certain policies. The idea that girls can‚Äôt have bra straps showing under their shirt is 100% there because it distracts the teachers I‚Äôve never seen a studenr stare at a girl cause she had bra straps showing but I‚Äôve seen some teachers do some interesting double takes at certain students and it‚Äôs fucking gross. the dress codes of most schools inherently sexualize children
Also I had to share a locker room with the people who sexually assaulted me so that was a fun experience which makes this issue quite personal to me
Illinois. Whiteside County. Blue cross blue shield of Iowa.
There are 2 accessable places that deal with trans kids, one in Chicago 3hr away and one in Iowa City 1.5 hours away. We went to Iowa. They suggested puberty blockers and said the one they do is a once a year subdermal implant. It cost $20,000 and without insurance you have to pay up front. I went to the local health department because they give free depo shots and the DEPO shot is an old-school puberty blocker but they only help transmen. They are a vagina only clinic. A lot of other places deal with transgender issues but not pediatrics.
I understand why they might think that. I just don't understand not doing a simple Google search. Like, if you're going to make trans children your enemy, wouldn't you research the enemy? I guess the idea is that if estrogen will help her ""be a girl"" then maybe testosterone would help her ""be a boy""? The lady looked so shocked when I told her that medicine had been trying to ""fix"" trans people's brains to match their bodies for hundreds of years before they even entertained the notion of making the body fit the mind. Like, Hello! They tried it your way and it didn't work!
Contact Howard Brown Health in Chicago. It's a good days drive from you, but they can offer affordable care. They do sliding scale and I believe they also take blue cross blue shield. They also partner with Walgreens and can offer discounts in their in house pharmacy. Here is their website. [Howard Brown Health](https://howardbrown.org/#) I'm actually in IL as well and I go there for everything, they are absolutely great. I believe they are also offering telehealth as well and they can request that your insurance cover certain meds that would normally be out of pocket."	qa2kl4	trans	255	0.99	2021-10-17 16:51:04

I got in a situation where I could have been beat up the other day. Always remember that digression is the better part of valour.	I hid in a bathroom stall for like 15 minutes waiting for them to go away if you are called out do anything you can to avoid being hurt. If it does come down to a fight give them a palm strike to underside of the nose it‚Äôll brake it. If you can avoid a fight or getting hurt do it by any means necessary but if you have to even if you can‚Äôt win give I‚Äôm hell.	"damn that sucks. Just about every fight I've been in has been with someone I trust, so I can't relate to hiding from a fight, but it sucks that you had to deal with that.
Only strike when you are struck, otherwise it is not self -defense. I used to be afraid to fight while growing up but I finally said fuck it. At some point you don't have anything to lose and only confidence to gain. Physical pain is only short term. Getting past your fears can open many doors.
This is why I carry a knife and train with it everyday 

It‚Äôs a karambit and I know it‚Äôs balance like the back of my hand 

Never gonna be a victim
This is good advice. I‚Äôm 100% sure if I wind up in this situation I‚Äôll be too angry and stupid to take it, but it‚Äôs good advice.
Don't listen to people that tell you to be the agressor and attack before being physically hit. Those are the same people that shouldn't own guns.
Never ever palm anyone in the nose. It can kill. Better off running away or taking it that going to prison for murder.
I'm glad you got away. Each of us are worth more than getting hurt fighting some asshole.
I don't trust myself to own lethal weaponry, just in case, but any time I am somewhere I don't know for certain I'll be safe I carry mace at the very least.
I‚Äôve gotten into enough wrestling matches with my boyfriend where I know I wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance. Luckily I don‚Äôt plan on being assaulted anytime soon.
I have a gun, a knife, and a can of whoop ass 

Haven‚Äôt had to use any of them yet, but they‚Äôre ready if needed
Pepper spray is your friend!
That situation happened only once my wife and I went to a club and for whatever reason I was looking particularly good that night I began getting stalked by this guy and when we left he began following us in the car I guess I should‚Äôve beenFlattered but my wife and I both agreed it was actually kind of scary I know it was for sex and he didn‚Äôt want to kill me it‚Äôs still felt scary
Attention seeking?
Train in self defense but avoid altercation. 

I'm sorry that happened. Glad you are safe.
You should never palm strike the underside of the nose, the force can press a part of bone in their brain and kill them, thats terrible advice, instead you should slap the side of their ear with a cupped hand, far less fatal and a guaranteed knockout given you give the correct amount of force.
i hope you‚Äôre safe now, that sounds really horrible. i hope everyone else here can stay as safe as possible through whatever means that is. it‚Äôs a tough fucking world out there
My now fiance, but was a boyfriend in school, was a Godsend. It was mostly ‚Äúmean girls‚Äù being their bitchy little selves. I refused to get into it with them because it could turn into a crap show with their parents saying ‚ÄúHE,‚Äù meaning me, beat up their precious little innocent girls. So my boyfriend who was abnormally tall and strong for a grade six/seven boy, would tell the girls if they did not stop, there would be consequences. Often he would open hand slap their boyfriends or brothers and would say to them to warn the girlfriends it would get worse. After that, it was usually fine. A few of those girls are friends now, and I was a bridesmaid and maid of honour at two of their weddings.

I wish no one needed a protector, but since the LGBTQ+ community is under attack so often, we seem to need one. I tell my friends to learn Krav Maga; you can pick up the basics quickly and learn defence and how to disable the attacker and escape. 

Fianc√© Here - Weapons are not a good way to go. To often they can be turned on you. Knives are extremely deadly in the right hands and guns can kill bystanders. The human body can do significant damage with training. My uncle taught me (he was an ex-Canadian soldier) that if your opponent cannot see, breathe or walk they cannot fight. Breaking the nose causes eyes to water up and breaking one is easy to do, punching or using elbows/shoulder into the upper chest can hinder breathing (no death, but it is painful) and kicking a knee out, especially at a side angle, is devastating, stomping on foot is extremely painful and you will break the little bones. 

If someone grabs you from behind, go limp, fall and roll if you can. You need just one second to change the outcome of an attack. Plus, speaking from experience if you are face to face, plunge a thumb into his eye. I didn't go deep enough to kill so I'm not sure if it's true you can kill someone by doing it, but the attacker will be in severe agony. 

But lastly and most importantly go out in groups to bars, running and screaming FIRE is better than a fight and always mind your surroundings. 

Stay Safe
Physical pain isn't always short term. If you get the shit beaten out of you, it can have longer lasting effects. Nerve damage is real. Be safe.
Never wait to be struck, agression and intimidation IS hostility. If you fear for your safety it is absolutely ok to attack first. It is very easy to make someone feel safe (at least safe enough to not need physical conflict). Doing otherwise and escalating hostility is itself a hostile act. As someone else replied getting hurt can have life long concequences. 

Never wait to be assaulted, it's to late then to properly respond and you've lost the chance to deescalate the encounter. Physical altercations are like chess games the advantage is to the one that strikes first. 

I use to be a VERY masculine alpha male type... 6'4"" 317lbs and ""country boy strong"" and not overweight. When I did get into fights I striked first, if they got within 1-2 feet of me and were displaying aggressive behavior I defended myself. I still believe that the best course of action is to strike first and strike so hard as to end the fight in one blow. My primary move and what I goto first is a choke slam, lift up with all force the opponent by the throat (irrelevant if you damage or kill them by crushing the windpipe) once in the air heave them away with enough force to cause them to achieve a horizontal position as the hit the ground. Done swiftly with agression matching a soldier at war, the fight is over right then (the opponents is unable to breath and prone on the ground). The aggression displayed and the ferocity will deter others from jumping in. 

If this fails they were already going to jump you anyways and you are now percived as a threat to any single one of those people which deters future attempts on their own. They will know it took many of them and that alone what happened to the first guy would have been them. 

Sadly this hyper agressiveness was something I had to develop as a child due to others agressions against me. I never started a fight and often would deescalate altercations between others. I was the skinny nerdy wimp in 9th grade, and by 12th grade I was that guy no one fucks with.

Admittedly it sounds counter productive to be hyper aggressive to prevent agression, however the majority of aggressors were those exhibiting toxic masculinity, of which the only counter is matching and then exceeding their aggressiveness and violence.

For the record I am now 6'2"" 217 lbs, have DD Cup breasts and quite feminine. However I will be dead before I ""allow"" someone to strike me first.
I'd be weary of carrying a knife. If your aggresor doesn't have a weapon, you could be escalating the situation, and be the one in bigger legal trouble. At least that's what it's like here in Canada.
 Also, if they take the knife from you somehow, now they have a weapon. O.O

Anyways, hope you never have to use it.
Sio what happens when you use that knife or worst case The knife gets taken off you and used on you Mate learn to box You don't want a criminal record or go to jail or end up dead with your knife stuck in your guts.
I also carry a karambit and have for the last 8 year! 

People can think what they must about the legal troubles, but so many trans men and women are killed every year. Take the legal judgment over the memorial.
Myth. The whole nose to the brain thing is an urban legend passed down by uneducated dads and poor self defense programs for years (like keys in knuckles come on). You'll break the cartilage, and fragile vessels in there causing severe bleeding which in a lot of circumstances can be enough to shock someone out of attacking. But it's a small target and you're more apt to miss when under adrenaline than actually land that blow. So aim for a target that is hard to miss and inflicts as much damage and pain as possible usually the groin. Either kick for there as hard as you can or grab with a cupping motion and squeeze for all you're worth. But if it's a fight and you're in fear for your life then everything is off the table.  Punch to the throat and break the trachea if you have to. Just know you'll go to jail and have to prove self defense to avoid prison for murder especially if you use a weapon (if they're unarmed and you pull a knife you're going to prison for sure). But if it's your life or there's shouldn't be a contest.

I‚Äôd have a gun but am not currently allowed to
I've never been in a bad enough fight to get any nerve damage or anything like that, but abt 3 years ago I was pressured into playing a slapping game called tennis with the strongest person in the school, and in the end my hand was a deep purple, dotted with black bruises,  swollen, and very painful, and the next month after that ordeal my hand hurt like hell, and even today my right hand hurts more than my left, not sure that's nerve damage but it's def proof that some pain can be permanent.
You shrank two inches... pog
Are you familiar with what a karambit is 
Those are damn near impossible to disarm 

Normally you‚Äôd just leverage the knife out of the assailants hand with blows from opposing directions , a karambit Is essentially attached to their finger
I‚Äôd rather die fighting for my life than let somebody make me an easy victim 

If people wanna kill people for being trans then why shouldn‚Äôt we train to approach a lethal threat with lethal intent and lethal actions
Never be afraid to defend yourself and strike first. Laws be damned, injuries can last a lifetime, never be the agressor but never be the victim. They had their chance to walk away before they got within choke slam range. Always warn someone if they haven't gotten physical yet that your intent if they continue hostility is to cause permanent harm. Ask if they enjoy depth perception as you will blind them if possible. Every single blow of every single physical altercation is a life or death moment. 

Strike first, strike hard, no regrets, no remorse, no mercy.
It‚Äôs not about the brain. There‚Äôs a lot more to the head than the brain.

Don‚Äôt neglect your shoes if you want to actually fight. I‚Äôve been stabbed in the eyes with stiletto heels so I thoroughly recommend adding that if you want to go to prison too. üôÇ
I did police training and martial arts, also boxing but thanks for assuming a shit ton of nonsense about me and the weird lecture about how to hold a key
Our police may be able to act like that with impunity but for us that's how you end up in prison. But sorry to say in the US a trans person in prison is also a very realistic death sentence. Most states won't house you with your identified gender but the sex at birth. So weigh your odds very very carefully.
I know if I am incarcerated I won't make it out. I'll just take it out on everyone in there and maim anyone I come into contact with they'll either have to drug me and hold me in solitairy or have a cell extraction team ready whenever they open my cage cause at that point fuck it I've been ready to die before, at least I'll take someone with me. Be damned if they wana treat me like an animal then that's what they'll get."	mj3x2h	trans	241	0.99	2021-04-03 07:41:18
I‚Äôm devastated and angry about the election results in Texas.	"I thought we had a chance. I thought Texas had finally had enough. I thought we were going to turn things around.

Instead, I get to make plans with my boyfriend to leave the city and friends and life that we love. I get to forget our plans to buy a house and make it our own. I get to live with the looming fear that any day I could wake up to the news that I no longer have the freedom to live as I am or take steps toward doing so. And I get to hate it all even more knowing that that‚Äôs exactly what they want.

They want us to live in fear. They want us to leave. They want us to give up on our home because we feel we have no other option. To them, we are an infestation that must be wiped out, by any means necessary.

Over the years, I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at not stressing over situations that I have no control over. But this one *hurts*. I don‚Äôt want to leave my home. As a teenager, I always believed that I‚Äôd gladly leave Texas at the first chance I got. But I made a life here. I found people and a city that I love. I‚Äôm happy. I don‚Äôt want to give that up.

And who knows. Maybe I won‚Äôt have to. But maybe isn‚Äôt good enough. I know there are so many people out there that are dealing with so much worse than this. I have it easy by comparison. But we all deserve to be happy. We all deserve to live our lives where and how we want without the threat of violence and persecution from people who don‚Äôt understand us. And our greatest hope for that shouldn‚Äôt lie in a flimsy ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù.

Things are hard right now. Our future is unclear. But, despite it all, I really do have hope. We may not be able to stay in Texas like we‚Äôd hoped. We may have to leave a lot behind. But we‚Äôll find a new home and build a new life. And we‚Äôll be okay.

To my fellow Texans and anyone else who is feeling angry and defeated tonight, you‚Äôre not alone. And wherever we end up, we have to keep fighting. We had some incredibly difficult losses tonight, but we also had some amazing wins! My city decriminalized marijuana! We should be proud.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I was feeling pretty low when I started writing this. None of this is easy. But getting it out helps a ton.üíõ

Edit: Just want to be clear, we‚Äôll only leave if we have to. If trans healthcare becomes illegal, and that is a big if, we will most likely leave. That‚Äôs what I meant when I said we would have to make a plan. We wouldn‚Äôt leave everything behind unless we felt like we absolutely had to for our mental and emotional well-being. We are fortunate enough to be able to make that decision if it comes down to it. Until then, we will absolutely continue fighting here. When I posted this, I was terrified at the uncertainty of our future and pissed off that I even have to think about that because of people that shouldn‚Äôt have any say in it. I still am. But like I said, I just needed to get it out. Now, I can think more clearly and look to the future with hope, for us and for Texas as a whole."	"Hey there! Texas is a DEEPLY red and gerrymandered state. I didn‚Äôt think Beto would win but I still pushed all of my friends to register and vote. Turning Texas blue will take continued, focused effort. It‚Äôs hard when we loose but do not become apathetic, that‚Äôs when they win. We will show up at the next election, we will continue to call out Abbot and his cronies. Hang in there buddy.

Also I‚Äôm from Denton too!! Yay decriminalization!! üçÉüëè
Keep trying guys and girls, keep your heads up so you don't drop your crown. Or cowboy hats. 

You have to lose a few battles to win the war. ""Winston Churchill once famously observed that Americans will always do the right thing, only after they have tried everything else.""
yeah... i'm kinda heartbroken. i thought my state would be way more blue, it looks like we flipped red. these monsters don't care, many (if not most) know they're lying to get votes... some genuinely believe in their rhetoric against minorities. it's depressing. too many people's rights are on the line
I hoped south Dakota had enough too, all the signs I saw for the dem governor made me hopeful. But it's red all down the line unfortunately. It's also a pretty red state though and I can't say I'm surprised. Just sucks though. Sorry you're going through this.
I wish my partner and I were in a financial state to leave.
Hey your feelings are valid. I may not understand exactly your situation, but i empathize and am deeply and truly sorry. If you are comfortable, I would like to pray for you <3 if not, that‚Äôs okay :)
I have contradictory thoughts on this. 

One is go and be safe and be somewhere you feel loved and appreciated and where your mental health is not jeopardized by bigotry in the same way it might be here.

The other is be hopeful or organize if you do stay. A friend of mine and I did a video last election cycle about the power of the younger generations to end all this. And it is real and exists because there are more of us,  but it takes more than just Tik-Tok advocacy. It takes turning all that frustration and anger and fear into lobbying and fundraising and getting out the vote and making people see that differences are not something to bear or punish, but something to glorify and something that gives the country it's power and possibilities. I'm not saying don't use social media, it's powerful af, but voting needs to become like second nature to everyone under 50 if we are going to get anywhere in this country. If I were you and stayed, I'd see if I could start a non-profit and go into schools and push for voting. I'd meet politicians. I'd collect stories, I'd go into churches and just advocate advocate advocate. I'd maybe look at running for office of some kind and encouraging others to do so.

Or I'd get out of Dodge. And you don't deserve judgement either way.
Lmao all the removed comments
Texas will turn blue within the next 15 years. Beto lost the election when he said he was going to take people's guns. As much as I agree with him, that was something very stupid to say in any state, blue or red.
Texas is only gonna get worse. Get out.

Putting your feelings into words is a great exercise. In life, most things are outside your control and letting those things control your emotions is a guaranteed path to unhappiness.

It seems like politics never go the way we want, probably by design. Have you considered what would happen if ‚Äúyour‚Äù candidate won?

Consider writing a list of what ‚Äúyour‚Äù candidate would have ACTUALLY done for you.

Would they have stopped the bigoted comment at the grocery store? No.

Would they be able to remove the threat of violence that you mentioned? No.

The best defense of the things you mentioned is to live a life free from fear, expressing your love freely. Your life sounds like it has some amazing things in it, if you can focus on those things you can start to change more and more of the works around you.

Well seeing as other states have banned allowing gender affirming care/treatment/procedures at certain levels there's that. Not to mention bashing/vilfifying/alienating trans folk has become the status quo so I can imagine having a large political group continuously attack you for existing would be detrimental to your mental health
While unclear, the state has *banned* gender affirming care in minors.  Supposing that ban might be expanded is plenty plausible.  Texas *just* voted to keep its governor, *despite* the fact that its energy grid and other infrastructure is in shambles.  It has voted to keep an attorney general who has spent his entire time in office racking up indictment after indictment.  It has voted to largely keep people in office who *insist* that somehow *they* will ""fix"" things *despite* having been in charge since the 90s.

While none of this is particularly surprising if you live in Texas, it is a stark reminder of where things stand.  Obviously the state isn't going to change its opinions on the basis of esoteric things such as transgender identities.  It won't even change its opinions on the basis of clear and *obvious* problems such as a governor who will spend billions on useless gestures such as keeping the national guard ineffectively watching a border while the grid collapses in the face of *cold weather*, or an AG who is apologetically *criminal*.

There is some good news, however.  Local elections saw *increased* support for sensible governance.  My school district solidly rejected a group of five people who ran on a platform that an be summarized as ""trans people are just the worst"", and even managed to kick out one board member who has been nothing more useful than a bubbling cauldron of hate to such an extent that they would regularly prevent useful work from being done such as refusing to pass a budget because a school library had a few books mentioning that LGBT people *exist*.
""Don't hate trans people"" you say. Your side seems real invested in challenging the way we live and stopping us living the life we live as much as possible.

If you're going to try and sell some horseshit, at least dump some perfume on it.

And how dare you come in here with your both sides crap. We are treated like this other lesser thing not deserving of rights. Yours wants to pretend you're the default and normal and anything outside of that is the perversion. We're fighting for our lives while you're fighting to keep us down. So yeah, you're gonna get some hate for that. No reason to be polite when someone's trying to deny your rights.
The fact you think acceptance is defined as ""being pushed on you"" is quite concerning. It's the ""you're safe and accepted as long as it's not in my neighborhood"". The same political environment for what? Last 35 years? Your electric grid is fucked, crime rate is going up, weather is getting worse, your cities are concrete jungles that won't allow rain water to be properly diverted. Your governor rails against acceptance and ""things being shoved down their throat"" so he could waste money and tax their residents. Constantly doing the same thing over and over again, and then blame liberals and the education system (that is failing everyone) is the definition of insanity. If you don't see that there's a problem in your thought process, well then...

I see the comment was deleted.
The Texas GOP platform essentially says ""gay and trans people shouldn't exist and we will make them wish they didn't."" And you don't want us existing ""flaunted in your faces?"" Replace trans people there with literally any other group and I hope you can see why that's fucked up. 

Love the both sides bit. People being angry at the ones bullying them is not ""hate."" It's being fed up with being used as a political scapegoat because we want to be happy. 

Just fuck off with your transphobic bullshit
Republicans DO hate trans people and acting like you don‚Äôt want to see shows that you do

We aren't ""flaunting in your faces"", we simply want to be ourselves
What does ‚Äúflaunted in our faces‚Äù mean?

I came out as transfemme to my wife yesterday	"So a short time ago, I happened to stumble upon the button question.  You know the one...  

    If you were presented with a button, a button that if you press it, while keeping everything else the same (friends, family, work, husband/wife, status, etc...) would immediately, as-if from birth, change you into the gender identity you wish...  However, pressing this button is PERMANENT.  It is impossible to switch back by any means once you press it. 
    
    Do you press the button?


Well, my answer was yes, without any hesitation or second thought.  I'd 110% be a woman.


I thought this was an ""oh haha funny stuff guys want boobies"" until it got me thinking.  One thing led to another, thought about how I used to dress up as a princess a lot as a young child, I would frequently *as a prank bro* wear girl clothes to school in highschool, in a very politically backwards and close-minded area.  I maybe enjoyed doing this a bit more than what I let myself or anyone think.  I've always been openly bisexual, and always a bit more feminine than what I ""should be"" as a cis male.  In fact, frequently throughout my life I would imagine what it would be like to be a woman, with all the bits & boobs to go with it.  


I learned through various supprt sites & trans subs, including (almost especially r/egg_irl), that perhaps this is not the typical behaviour of a cis-male.  I read that trans bible thing (albeit not in full, but enough).  One thing that took the cake for me was that I started actually imagining myself as a woman.  With cute outfits and pretty dresses, being a pretty lady, hell maybe a sexy lady even.  I didn't really understand ""trans euphoria"" until then.  Just by imagining this, the feeling deep down into my heart of hearts, a hot warmth of vibrationy joy and content... The only thing I can really compare it to is the love I have for my wife, but different and more personal.


I quick realized yeah, ya boi is also ya gurl.


It took me awhile to get the courage to say something to my wife.  It's actually quite scary having to come out.  I've never really had to come out before because I've always been out.  But this was like, real, and it mattered much more than just being bisexual.  I was nervous, and being the awkward autistic egg, didn't quite know how to bring it up.  And frankly also felt a bit guilty for not being able to, because I don't keep things from my wife - we tell each other everything.  So yesterday, I sent my wife a text, or more, a wall of one, explaining everything that I realized and discovered.  As soon as my 7-book series just to say ""I'm trans"" was written, I closed my eyes, held my breath, and pressed send.


A few moments later (she's a fast reader I guess), my wife came to me and asked if I wanted to talk in the bedroom or right here.  My heart was racing.  We got to the bedroom, and she told me she loved me, and nothing I could ever do could change that.  And she supports me and will do whatever she can to help, and that she's very proud of me.  Honestly, she said a lot of things that I can't really remember because as soon as she started, I was crying.  She told me she wasn't really surprised considering who I am, and since she herself is bi, it's a win-win for her.  Immediately after the emotions and talking about everything from HRT & surgery to pronouns and names, she was doing up my measurements so I can buy myself some new clothes, and was getting really excited about going shopping together! In fact I bought some new clothes online yesterday evening and in the mean time she's letting me borrow her bras, dresses, leggings & any makeup I might need until I get my own!  She told me she hasn't seen me so outwardly happy before, and just oh my god.  She is perfect.  I am a very lucky *wom-man*.  I honestly don't know what I was so worried about.  Obviously my amazing also gay wife would be totally cool with me being trans.  I told her it was fine to tell her friends and we're all gonna be going shopping soon!  Life is gonna be even better now.


tl;dr: I came out as transfemme to my wife and both are both excited about el booba."	"Congrats! Glad to hear it went well. Supportive spouses are the best. ‚ù§

You guys sounds right for each other, no matter who has booba or who doesn't, which will more than likely be both of you soon!

Sisterly advice. My sister came over to borrow a dress for a wedding she was going to. That made me feel good. She brought my mom along to help her decide.

Oregon introduces a bill that will mandate that insurance covers ALL gender-affirming care!	"[Here is the source.](https://twitter.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1628641691832918016?s=20)

EVERY single senate democrat cosponsored the bill.

It would mandate that insurance covers ALL gender-affirming care - surgeries, hormone therapy, FFS, hair removal, everything. 

It joins 3 other states who do this (Washington, Colorado, and Hawaii.)

In light of the slew of anti-trans bills being introduced, it's nice to have a few wins. (Erin goes more in-depth in her blog posts.)

ETA: a detail."	"I'm in CO. we're still working out the kinks on this, but so far it's been going well
Finally! A state that's moving in the right direction!! The rest of you 46 States could learn something..
I am sososososo happy to see other states doing the opposite of the red crazy states.

A few years ago I was looking to move out of state and start a new exciting chapter of my life. Lately, I've been seeing the # of states I could move safely to shrinking one by one, with the list being all of 4-5 I'd feel comfortable with.

I am thrilled to see another state *officially* become an ally.

So it turns out my mum genuinely believes I'm trying to hurt her by talking about lgbtq rights.	"**tldr; Currently closeted w/ family. My mother refuses to consider that trans people are real or deserve to exist, and I may just give up on her. Considering just leaving and cutting ties.**

I've spent a good five years now at least trying to approach my mother about her ""opinions"" on us, and the various sexualities so that I might come out to her, but have made little headway. I've been trying to get through about being gay first of all, because I thought that might be easier to convince her about, and now she at least keeps quiet about her views most of the time, but the reality is that I don't think I'm ever going to get her support. 

Most of the times I bring the subject up she'll shut it down asap. If she doesn't, she'll start talking about how ""it's all she's ever known"" to think of being lgbt as a sin, and the longer the conversations go on, the more baseless her arguments can get. She ""doesn't believe in biology"", however is perfectly happy to quote scientific studies anytime as long as it's not to do with being gay or trans. At one point, I was clearly winning an argument, and thought I may have finally found a way to get through to her, but was subsequently hit with ""you may be right, but it's not what I choose to believe"" and other things along the lines of ""you're right but actually no you're not bc I don't like it"".

Today it was a short ""discussion"", and I'd like to make clear that none of these start out as arguments. I'll usually start with something like ""I'd like to talk about this with you, because this is something very important to me and I want you to consider my point of view."" Immediately, she started complaining and seemed to be on the verge of tears, saying that I ""always know where to hit her during these arguments"". I tried to explain I didn't want to argue with her, but she protested that ""It'll always be heated"" if I have it with her. I felt very close to completely snapping and left the room.

I'm really hurt that my mother thinks I try to have these talks just to push at buttons. I cannot, however, say I'm surprised. It's not that first time she's accused of me of ""attacking her beliefs"", and she's told me to my face many times that I'm ignorant of others, rude and too blunt, or just a bad person generally. I really had hope that I might have her support, even if not now then in a few years, but I think I might have to face the possibility that she'll never see me as a man. My best option might just be to come out, and leave the next day. Go minimal contact. It'll be painful, because maybe we're not really that close, but she still means a lot to me, and maybe it is stockholm syndrome but I still love her.

Sorry for the long vent, I just really need the release right now."	"You know what‚Äôs really convincing? Losing your kid to your prejudices and closed mindedness.
""You're a bad person,"" because you're making her feel like a bad person, for refusing to update her own beliefs to be both more accurate and more humane. Wow. That's quite the manipulative tactic she's got there. No wonder you need to vent. 

You've done all you can. When you reach a point where you're financially stable and able to care for yourself, it may be in your best interests to do exactly that: Come out, and if it doesn't change anything, just leave. It's hard, no doubt, but you won't be the first of us that's had to do it. There's love and support out there for you, even if it's not coming from her.
Yep, raise anchor and leave that old ironclad in the dust. You need to dump her, she's needlessly dragging you down.
Yeah that's a classic narcissistic trait. When faced with the prospect that their beliefs are bad (therefore they are bad) they pathologically reject and rationalize the information however they can in order for their beliefs to be preserved, rather than acknowledging their wrongful beliefs and correcting them.
I grew up with 2 narcissists, and this is TEXTBOOK narcissism. Her caring about her religion over your happiness is the only red flag you need to cut her off.
A person like that can only be helped by themselves. If you cut her off, you'll have to tell her why or she will never reevaluate her ""beliefs"". Either way, you are going to have to actually cut her off for quite some time or she will, consciously or not, just try to hurt you until you relent. Its going to be hard. I am sorry you have to deal with this.
Yeah that's toxic af. This is probably doing a lot of harm on your mental health and it's just better to leave. I know it'll be difficult but you need to take care of yourself and continuing this will do nothing but harm you. I wish you luck.
Wow self centred much
That first is a really good point. I hadn't considered it before really, but now you've pointed it out it seems kinda obvious that this is what's been going on. Damn.
This is probably the one thing that annoys me most, like, you are not your beliefs??? Knowing my mum though she uses religion as a stand in for a real personality.
Yikes, growing up with two narcissists sounds like something you should get a reward for.  I guess I didn't explicitly say it but yeah my mum's a mormon, which comes with it's own set of issues.
The unfortunate part of that is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs going to affect you very negatively either way. Whether she means it or not, it‚Äôs still a threat to your mental health and it shouldn‚Äôt be tolerate. Your mother should love you unconditionally, and that is not unconditional love.


The best advice I have as someone who‚Äôs dealt with narcissists and narcissistic behavior is that there‚Äôs no way to please them if you aren‚Äôt giving them EXACTLY what they want. Coming out to her and going dark afterwards (like you mentioned) sounds like a better option than not coming out and sticking around. Stay strong, OP."	tvjvub	trans	167	0.96	2022-04-03 21:03:14
I think I mark this as a win	"Today I had an interesting experience. I was out at Subway with my brother, and out sandwich maker was an old coworker.  I last saw her years before I started transitioning. She just greets me with ""Your dress is so cute hun, what can I get you""

She remembered my brother and started asking him how his brother was.  My brother just points at me and says my sibling is with me. She looks at me for a moment. She responded, ""noyour brother, the one I used to work with.""  My brother just pointed at me and I sorta shyly waved.  Her face lit up so much and she said, ""Oh my god, I didn't recognize you at all. Your so pretty now."" When she was done with our order and the person behind us, she came out and asked to hug me. She thanked me for always being so nice to her when we worked together.

Initial misgendering (because she didn't know) aside, it was such a wholesome encounter. It was also a huge confidence boost to not only get genuine compliments, but to also not be recognized."	"Oh this is absolutely a win! Not only did she not recognize you when you are finally presenting as your authentic self but she remembers your kindness long after you stopped being her daily life. Obviously your true nature was coming out to those around you even when you were not ready to share the whole you with the world. Congratulations for being the kind of person this world needs more of.üòçü•∞
This an unquestionable win! Points for passing and no hesitation acceptance and love. Can‚Äôt blame her for not knowing, and who can say they‚Äôve never had a slow moment connecting the dots? Love that for you

Congrats to you though, I'm so happy for you! üíúüòÅ
Makes me smile :)
That‚Äôs so cool!

I wouldn‚Äôt even take it as being misgendered because she seems to not have known you were the person supposed to be your brothers brother (does that make sense? No native speaker)
This one made me tear up! Happy for you girl!
I have always tried to be nice to everyone and a hard worker. People have always seemed to really like me or really dislike me. They always seem to remember me.
I think so too. I don't blame her for not knowing. It felt great.
Thank you. I am hoping that this will give others hope. If myself a 6'5"" larger girl can get seen like this. Then so can they.
I did. thank you. I hope you had a wonderful day too. <3

That was my goal. I hope this will make your day better. <3
Yea not blaming her at all. <3
Your response reminded me of something my therapist told me. When you put your true self out there for people to see, the people who are doing the same see you and embrace your truth, the people who are putting on a false front see you and it shines a light on their falsehood and they need to distance themselves from the light. It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them. You keep on being the real you and don't lose any sleep over those who may need to avoid your light. Shine on my friend.üòä
I'm 6'1 with broad shoulders as well, not to mention (what at least feels like) an enormous ribcage ü§£, so I very nearly know how you feel.

I seem to attract the third kind. The ones who will take advantage of me. I am trying to get better st recognizing it without closing up and becoming too cynical.
I bet your killer üå∂ in heels. <3 I have trouble finding shoes that fit in men's and unisex sizes. üò≠  I am saving for a custom made pair.
I mean, not to brag or anything, but most of my ex's couldn't walk in heels to save thier life, I could walk, hell, I could RUN circles around them in heels with no problem, maybe not like the super tall ones, but still ü§£

I'm not sure where you're located, but there's a store called Torrid which has some *fairly* nice stuff at not too expensive a price. Just need to get around the fact that it's a women's Big & Tall store (not that there's anything wrong with being big or tall, just a *little* demoralizing (personally), what I wouldn't give to be able to shop at forever 21 üòÖ).

But they have larger shoe/clothing sizes, with wide options for shoes (idk what the upper limit is, but I was able to get some 11wide heels and boots and they fit practically perfectly). Personally the majority of the store isn't my style (I prefer hot topic type stuff) but they do have some nice stuff and I'll definitely be shopping there more. (Also did this in store, and as you can tell I'm nowhere near passing yet, but the ladies were really nice and helpful, didn't feel judged).
I have heard of Torrid. My ex wife shopped there. I didnt know it was a tall store. My ex described it as for bigger women.  I have 14.5 womens size. Even places that brag about having larger sizes seem to stop at about 13. Then they only have Crocs in larger sizes.

  I love hot topic, but being so tall I couldn't shop there even before I gain weight. They are all sized for mediums and larges.

It is good you had a good experience there. I might have to try it next time I have money to spend on cloths.
Torrid is a godsend I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1 and a size 16 they have sizes 10 to 30 and i have never been misgendered or belittled in one of their stores and I‚Äôm pre everything and live in Oklahoma.
Get iit gurl!

It feels like cis people are fine with us as long as we're not successful or visible.	"There's a lot of anger I'm experiencing today that I don't know where to put.

I'm still mad about what happened to Isabel Fall. I'm angry that people doxx us the second we stand up for our own rights. I'm pissed off about every cis person suddenly becoming an endocrinologist the second a trans woman wins an event.

As long as we hide and they don't have to see us everything is fucking hunky-dory. That's how I understand it was in the eighties --- woodwork yourself into oblivion so no cis person has to experience the unbearable indignity of being in line behind a person who's obviously trans. And God help you if you're also gay, which like half of us are.

I try to understand where, precisely, the anger is coming from where something like this happens. Behind anger there usually lies fear. I think that's the key. I like science fiction. I like lifting weights. I'm trying to be fit enough to run a triathlon some day. I should not have to risk being the main character of the internet for a day for pursuing my fucking hobbies. Perhaps that's an unfounded fear. But I can't shake it from my mind. It's happened to my friends. It could be me tomorrow.

The worst part is that I have absolutely no idea what I can do about it. It just feels like this is the way the world is."	"If you feel safe and able to be visible, be visible. It's how we'll end up winning - by showing people we're just people like they are.

I am looking at Lia Thomas, perfectly represents the situation you are talking about
I think some people are just lazy. They want the gold star for going through the motions and waving flags in support. They don't actually want to do anything to change anything or relate to anyone as a real person.

I'm getting all my paperwork sorted out and after wasting so much time explaining structural discrimination and discrimination to people and have it go in one ear and out the next after this is done my being trans has nothing to do with them. It's simply not going to be a talking point and they have no right to know or ask questions or get a  free education on my time. That means energy can be saved for discussing important things with people who matter and get things done.
Imagine saying all cis people are transphobic.
It‚Äôs more like cis people are fine with us as long as we‚Äôre unsuccessful, invisible, or dead.
Exactly what I'm referring to.
Where do you see the word all? Show me, I must have missed it. Or you're just completely ignoring the fucking point.
There is no all, but in the title ypu said cis, not some, just cis, if you wanted people to be able to distinguish that, you should've written some.
I'm not OP. I'm just saying OP didn't claim ""all cis people"".
I still dont know why youre trying to start fights ovet this, like what are you going to get out of this, but OP should've distinguished ""all"" from ""some""
I wasn't referring to individual cis people. I was referring to the social group in the abstract.

I also didn't claim that all cis people are anything. I said I *felt like* something. Feelings don't have to be rational.
What fucking social group were you reffering too?
Cis people? The same way that when Black people vent about white people they're not really talking about any specific white person but the sum of their experiences with white people?"	ti8lvz	trans	154	0.96	2022-03-20 00:10:01

"""I identify as a...."" transphobia"	"Really beginning to doubt myself again.

The endless series of ""35 year old man identifies as 11 year old boy, smashes record breaking home run to win little league world series"" type memes honestly make it so hard to accept that what I'm feeling is anything more than mental illness. 

I wish I could point to a neurologic, genetic, or biologic test that proves hey, I'm an AMAB with the mind and soul of a woman. There has to be more than, cis men and women don't doubt their gender.

Instead, I see these memes and think, ""are they really wrong?"" Is my overwhelming urge to live as a woman just that, a desire? No different than obsessing over a job title, or being famous, or getting into a certain school? 

While I know the majority of people who post the ""I identify as a cat"" memes are transphobes, I can't help but feel I'm no more of a woman than the hypothetical cat person is really a cat. Why is my belief that I was born into the wrong body any more valid than someone who thinks they should have been born a cat? 

Ughhhh, I hate all of the doubt and second guessing. I just want to crawl into a hole and disappear."	"You are capable of filling most of the social roles of a woman and taking hormones of a woman. One can not do those things to essentially be a cat.
I totally understand the frustration, & I want you to know you are totally valid as you are. 

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think any transphobe is going to think you‚Äôre *more* valid with a test result, were there one.

I think imposter syndrome feelings are pretty ‚Äònormal‚Äô when transitioning. They suck, a lot. The best advice I can give is those memes are just memes, meant for ‚Äúhumor‚Äù, albeit shitty humor, and they don‚Äôt represent you as a person. 

Wishing love and luck,

Having the desire/urge to live as a woman *is* being trans. You really don't need more proof than that.
The desire to transition is so alien to cis people that they are only capable of framing it in terms of ridiculous memes where trans people change in order to live out petty and bizarre fantasies. What you are reading is people who are not like you trying to make sense of a feeling they don't understand at all, a feeling that you do understand because you've had it.

I know it's not that different from 'cis men and women don't think this way' but that mindset has really helped me push through a lot of that reductive transphobia. The gap of understanding when it comes to the actual experience of being trans is just so vast.
This is something I used to struggle with too.

Sure there isn‚Äôt a test we can take to prove it, but there is obviously a part of our brain that is saying, ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm supposed to be a woman wtf.‚Äù We don‚Äôt know enough about the brain to know exactly why that happens, but it‚Äôs a consistent variation that many people experience and currently the best way to to fix that disconnect is transitioning.

I think it‚Äôs less that cis people don‚Äôt doubt their gender and more like, cis people don‚Äôt think about this constantly and struggle with gender their whole life. I know some cis people who have introspected a lot with their gender identity and have doubted it at times, but still coming to the conclusion they are cis and are happy with that.

Sure, it‚Äôs technically a desire but it can be a different kind of desire than being famous. And there is medical consensus that it‚Äôs a desire you can and should do something about if it‚Äôs causing you to struggle a lot.

Hope some of these words helped üíú
Is it just a desire? No. It's not well medically understood but trans people do show different genetic variations to explain in different ways why they may be trans. 

The consistency of mental health afflictions for trans people who can't transition, separate them from groups of people like ""folks who want to be celebrities"" or whatever.
So I will offer my perspective. We use language to better understand each other and the world around us. For a long ass time deviations from the norm have been frowned upon in most cultures.

Well we live in a time and place where due to having access to internet so many of us who experience gender dypshoria can now communicate and what would you know language evolves so we can learn to better understand each other.

There definitely is a resistance tons of people have about gender identity but you can dismiss it all you want we are not going away.

Also how much of a spectrum gender can be. Some people don't have extreme dypshoria about body parts and some people embrace non binary label. Why are our existences not valid? Many people don't relate at all with gender dypshoria so they mock you and belittle you. Happens alot when people don't understand someone/something. 

I hope you choose your happiness over people's uninformed judgements
I totally get your doubts and struggle with them a lot myself. But another trans guy asked me this and it's been a MASSIVE help to me: are you afraid you're not really trans or are you afraid no one will believe you? 

I realized then I'm afraid no one will believe me cause I KNOW I've always wanted to be a boy. I personally only started doubting after I came out to my parents and received a barrage of questions and them trying to force me to doubt myself. 

Also when you think about it, it's silly to compare being trans to seeking fame or glory because it isn't about attention, it's about being able to be your true self. Anything after that is separate. And cis people are stupid as all fuck if they think people pretend to be trans just to assault women in bathrooms or win sports competitions üôÑ literally so FUCKING stupid. why on earth would you go to excessive lengths and willingly become something much of society despises to be a bad person??? It makes 0 sense I wish  they would think about what they are saying for longer than 2 seconds. If someone is a bad enough person to assault other people, they will just do it LMFAO they aren't going to take years of transitioning and surgery just to start hurting people? üò≠ Sorry to get heated the utter stupidity just makes me so angry. These people don't use their brains at all. Of course they wouldn't understand questioning gender because they haven't questioned a single thing in their entire lives üôÑ

Anyways I hope the comments on this post help and you feel a bit better ‚ù§Ô∏è it's great to get outside perspective and reassurance sometimes
Genuine question but do others really desire to be trans? I don‚Äôt know at least for me I wish I was happy in my gender at birth. Things would be a lot easier. But I cannot deny myself how I feel. Finally being somewhat open and exploring trans I realized my mental health, how I percieve myself, being introverted, etc. So much improved so fast that it has to be right for me. Even though I don‚Äôt desire it, I embrace it now I suppose.
Men and women aren‚Äôt different species. Changing the gender you present as can‚Äôt equate with changing species. Children grow into men and women and sometimes it happens naturally while other times it requires medical assistance. (Sorry for the oversimplification )
They don‚Äôt really think they are cats though. They‚Äôve just stolen someone else‚Äôs stale, tired, clapped out old ‚Äòjoke‚Äô and wrapped that Lump in a differently-coloured sugar coating.

You really feel what you feel and that alone makes it valid. Try not to let these low-goober asshats get to you, and I know that is far harder than it sounds just saying it.

Remember, this society has all guns blazing in an effort to force us all into the crappy little pigeon holes they‚Äôve prepared for us. You realise your own lived reality, which means you are more than halfway there; you‚Äôve broken the chains that bind so many of us to their version of reality.

Its so hard, especially when we are misled, shamed and head-tricked into disbelieving our own lived reality, so it is necessary to stay away from their baleful, toxic, misrepresentations.
What you are feeling is the way that your brain it made up, like a more female than male brain or vice versa. What you are feeling is valid, and should be unapologetic about it.
Here's some science for you- female lions, iirc 5 of them, were observed to have grown male lion manes and act as male lions. So hey, science backs us up literally everywhere.

Thank you for sharing. There's so much hard earned knowledge and life experience in this group :)
So much truth. Yes, please put me in this box that so many people look at with disdain...sign me up for that, cause it sounds fun! ü§î

I guess the first part though, I'm actually afraid of a lot of things... like would I ever pass and could that actually feel worse if I didn't ever get there? What could happen with my job? Friends and neighbors that I know and love, but maybe don't really understand what this all really mens to me...But far and away, the biggest fear for me is hurting the people I love by making them question if they ever really knew me...by taking the life we built together and flipping it on its head because I realized something about myself so late in life...or that I couldn't just embrace the body I was born into. I don't want them to suffer for this, I just feel like that was never part of that ""bargain"" if you know what I mean.
I do desperately wish I could just try HRT and see how living as a woman changes my life, and if it hurt my marriage/family, I could just press reset so that it's as if it never happened at all.
Occam's razor...I like simple.
It's so true. Growing up in the 80's and 90's I feel like all of the media references were so toxic and negatively portrayed.

Switching to estrogen could save you 15% or more on car insurance ü¶é	Updated my information with insurance and dropped my insurance premium by a little over $9 per month. Gotta celebrate the small wins too sometimes.	"IVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR MONTHS!!!! I'm 22, have driver training, no accidents or tickets and I was paying nearly 3 grand a year. So I get my name and gender marker changed and swapped to a different company. I SAVED OVER $700 A YEAR!
Mine went up. Ironically I have progressive.
Lmao wonder how *that* algorithm is calculated
Not in Europe!
So did you need to change your social.to get the discount or just your id, etc?
WIN!!
I thought this was an actual ad üò≠
That's not very progressive of them.
 They follow statistical averages and Women tend to be ""safer"" drivers on average so it makes sense. Thankfully they don't usually get too heavy on the price difference based on what hormones are in ur body. Overall I'd argue it's discrimination still though and they could easily get into some slippery shit if they took their pricing bs far enough.
I only updated my information after I had changed my social. Not sure what would have happened had I tried before that
Can't change your name on ID without first updating your social
I found out the trick is to completely swap companies and do everything online. Then they don't know who I used to be and can't use it to discriminate.
Wait how do you change your social? I thought you couldn't do that unless you had a court order after filing a police report for identity theft.
It might depend by state, but I already have my id changed but still need to change social
Fair yea a lot of hunting is the only way unfortunately
I got a court ordered name change. Then after dealing with one transphobic social security worker I went to a different office and showed them my new ID and Court Order for the name change and they updated all my information. I didn't get a new SSN, they just changed the name and gender attached to it.
Jeez I was hoping there was a way to change the whole number. I have a malicious cis ""parent"" that has mine memorised but there's not enough to get anything legally done about it. xD"	z8gg63	trans	107	0.98	2022-11-30 03:54:25

If anyone needs to hear this right now, remember, you have a right to exist.	"I know that the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe vs Wade is very discouraging to all of us. We now know that they‚Äôre coming for LGBT rights next. As disheartening as all of this is the last thing anyone should be considering right now is moving states or moving to another country. If you leave, THEY WIN! That‚Äôs exactly what they want us to do. Just remember that by leaving, you‚Äôre leaving behind your fellow LGBT pupils who aren‚Äôt as fortunate enough to just get up and go. Life for them will become even more difficult. 

Remember what Pride is all about. That we as a community are strong together. That we WILL be visible and will NOT tolerate tyranny. It‚Äôs taken us so much work to get to where we are today. Don‚Äôt just let it all slip through our fingers!"	"Thank you.

TODAY, June 24, 2022, a date which will live in infamy the civil rights of citizens of the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by the Supreme Court of that same nation.It will be recorded that the slow nature of the judicial process makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time the Court has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.The court has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the national area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The people of the United States who respect the rights of others have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our Nation.But always will our whole Nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated assault, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by the Court on Friday, June 24, 2022, a state of war has existed between the United States government and her people.

Throughout our history, America's darkest days have always been followed by its finest hours. I believe this is no exception. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, so that in a thousand years they will still say, ‚ÄúThese were our finest hours.""I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of the community. We will defend to the death our rights, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of our strength.We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall defend our selves, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight in the courts and legislatures, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat, if I must go, then I'll go down swinging. I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my people. Esto mecum fortis Johnston, ut tuum nobile sacrificium sequor in illam bonam noctem et placidam quietem. Insontem a malo defendens usque ad ultimam cordis pulsationem. We non delebitur. QUOD OMNES Dicimus!

Are right wing transphobes winning?	"I recently saw trumps anti trans video and honestly I feel sick, it‚Äôs terrifying. But what‚Äôs more terrifying is the amount of people that agree with it. I saw an abundance of comments agreeing with ‚Äúcommon trump w‚Äù etc, and I‚Äôm seeing hate and violence towards trans people grow by the day and all I can think when I see it is ‚Äúwe‚Äôve lost‚Äù yet we‚Äôre the victims here, none of us asked for this, none of us chose to be trans or gay or anything so why are we being attacked so harshly?
It‚Äôs hard to believe that true justice exists in the world when things like this happen.
And the right just refuse to hear us out and talk about this properly with love for each other.

Too much blood has been spilt over this and it only looks like if things continue this way a lot of us are going to die, and I don‚Äôt mean to be so dramatic but yes a lot of us are going to die, this is genocide. 

I‚Äôm sorry this post isn‚Äôt the most uplifting post to read but idk what to do, I‚Äôm planning on running somewhere remote and hiding from everything so that I can live."	"Here are two sayings: ""A wounded animal is the most dangerous."" And ""A cornered animal is just as dangerous as a wounded one."" The right are both wounded and cornered. Young people are more progressive and left leaning, and they will have and will become the people who vote. Millennials are not showing signs that they are becoming conservative as they age, and Gen Z are more progressive than Millennials. So, the conservatives are a decade or two away from not having enough voters to vote for them.

The right is being as transphobic as they are mostly out of desperation. They saw Desantis's victory in Florida in 2022 and figured being transphobic is a winning strategy. And because they are desperate to keep their support, they are doing whatever they can to either force their way into power or change minds by making people afraid of minorities like us.

Are they winning? No. Absolutely not, especially if we continue to fight back. They are losing, and conservatives have always lost. If they didn't, we wouldn't be here talking about it. They might take a few victories here and there, and at worst, they may even make the US a theocratic dictatorship. But would that mean they won? Absolutely not. It only means that progress was set back. History shows that progress and change are inevitable because people will always fight for better things. They may win the battle. But we've already won the war, they just don't know it yet.
US conservatives are anywhere from disagreeable to fucking crazy. Plus it's a pretty fucking large country there will be plenty of people who agree with any statement.
I know. It‚Äôs all wrong. By rights we shouldn‚Äôt even be here.
But we are. It‚Äôs like in the great stories my random online friends.
The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were,and sometimes you didn‚Äôt want to know the end.
Because how could the end be happy.

How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it‚Äôs only a passing thing, this shadow.
Even darkness must pass. A new day will come.

And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, my random online friend, I do understand.
I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn‚Äôt. Because they were holding on to something. That there‚Äôs some good in this world, my darling. And it‚Äôs worth fighting for.

Keep in mind that all over the US this year, there have been law after law turned down, Some parts are losing battles more than others. But that does not mean it's over or that the time to despair. Its the time to be loud, resolute, be active and make it known that the time for passive quiet allyship is over. The beacons are lit and the trans community has called for aid. 

If they don't stand with us publicly (aka post about it and stuff) the oppressors will assume that they stand with them. Bully on a playground style.  Things will likely get worse, they will get darker for sure, but we will prevail. 

We will prevail today, and tomorrow and every other day until the ruination of the world where no one can stand any more and on that day, that day we rest. Knowing we did what we were born to do. Exist. Live. Thrive.
Are incels winning? 

Only if you define ""winning"" as ""desperate and loud"".
Honestly, Gen Z and millennials are on average more tolerant, so hopefully in the next few generations, trans rights will prevail. Here's to hoping.
I sadly agree that the haters are gaining ground at the moment.  We (and our allies) have to turn this around somehow.
I think we're about to reach the point the fever is going to break. Someone else already pointed out that Gen Y and Gen Z are more likely to be okay with everything even among youthful gen Z conservatives they tend to be bringing the Republicans left. 

At this point were seeing the last breath of boomer xer power because as boomers age out Xers don't have the cohort size to maintain control to the level they would want to. 

Again it seems were nearing the twilight of this age of internal hostility from my perspective. Could be wrong but I'm hopeful. 

All in all the last gasps as power struggles begin usually leads to excessive lashing out and stroking harder then ever.
I think it can seem that way online, and it's a scary time for us for sure, but I think in reality there are more people with us than against us.
I went to high school in the 90s. Civil rights take steps forward and steps back, but if it is of any consolation, we are living in a completely different world - a much better one - than we did 30 years ago on this front. Slowly but surely they are losing.
America goes thru religous revivals and we are just getting started on the one we are in now. Trump is just pandering for votes to see what he has for a base.
The people you‚Äôre seeing in the comments are all people who were going to agree with him anyways. It‚Äôs nowhere near an accurate reflection of trans-related opinions in western countries. In reality the majority of people (overall) are supportive of trans people, and that is a huge growth compared to 20 years ago. Keep pointing out how dumb as shit conservatives talking points are, and eventually more people will agree that they have no clue what they‚Äôre saying. There will always be an audience of transphobes, but so long as the number of people who aren‚Äôt keeps growing, we‚Äôll be fine.
In the USA? Probably. The USA is one of the first world countries with the most issues with being ""other"".

By being ""other"", I mean being non-white or non-cis or non-straight or even just being a woman who doesn't act submissive to men. If you're different from the typical people of a 1940s commercial depicting the perfect family (the man of the house in a suit and tie bringing the bread home, his stay at home submissive wife in a frilly apron waiting for him with dinner on the table, and a few well behaved children, all Christians and all white) then as far as the USA is concerned there's something wrong with you.

So, while the liberal side of politics is trying to change that, you still have a lot of people among liberals who thinks going as far as ""accepting trans rights"" or ""admitting gay people are just normal people with normal relationships"" is going too far, because they're too ""other"" so there's something wrong with them.

So it's not so much that transphobes are winning, so much as the fundamental mentality of the USA is what's stopping the changes that need to happen. Things are slowly getting better, but the pushback by those who don't want ""others"" around will only increase.

I would expect things to get a lot worse before they get better.
Define ""winning"".

Do you mean, have they brainwashed a cross section of Americans into betraying and squandering everything our recent ancestors fought and sacrificed for?  If so, yes.  

They're winning also if you mean to ask whether they have persuaded some citizens to abandon every principle upon which this nation was founded.  

Likewise, if you ask whether they have created legions of people who explicitly threaten Constitutional rights without even having the education to know that's what they're doing.  

Is it that you wonder whether they march this union ever closer to breaking up into two nations; one wealthy and advanced, one a dirt poor backward theocracy?  Then yep.  

But if you want to ask if they'll get rid of us, never.  Not now.  Not in the near future.  Not in any age of mankind yet to come.  They never could, they can't, and they never will.  

They're not gods.
They're winning battles, but they won't win the war.
They‚Äôre still technically a minority overall, but depends where you are. However, they‚Äôre not winning if I have anything to say about it
No what we are experiencing is the desperate dying gasps of a ideology whatever progress is made people try to push back these tend to be temporary but violent setbacks 

The vast majority of people supporting transphobia are at the tail end of their life span and every new generation seems to be more accepting than the last
no they aren‚Äôt. they want to utterly eradicate us and as long as just one of us is standing they‚Äôll never win.
Trans people are not going away. More people need to vote the haters out if office! Too many fail to vote.
IMHO, no they are not winning on the whole. However, they do have the Red States pretty well locked down and as long as they have SCOTUS it will stay that way. They have to be loud and toss rotten red meat to the magats daily to keep them riled up or they'll lose power even at the state level. They're really fascists and it's really dangerous, but the ""common clay"" that makes up the base is brittle af. 

Spent a good deal of time on Parler being openly Jewish and AntiFa so I could enjoy some ""legitimate political discourse"" with them. A LARGE portion of the supposedly Murica First alpha bros online are total frauds, if not completely fake profiles.
Look. I get it. I try to consider all possibilities, and I'm working on a plan for if I'm wrong but...

What I'm seeing is a ton of unconstitutional bills get introduced by random state legislators.

These bills are wildly illegal. They will be struck down, or at least they will if the Supreme Court does their job. And if they don't, we just need to hold out until one or two REALLY OLD men die. Or they push things too far and Biden is forced to stack the court.

Young folks are pushing more progressive every Generation. Republicans know this. Democrats know this. And in every one of the elections of my lifetime, or at least since 2008, we've had ""record youth turnout"", and Boomers are dropping like flies. What's more, Millenials and Gen Z are much, much, MUCH less inclined towards religion than our parents were. Republicans and Church leaders are scared and lashing out, but they don't have the power to beat us unless we let them.

I think we're gonna be okay.
No they're whining.
From my viewpoint, it all seems desperation moves. Their hateful rhetoric has no substance, so they must shout the louder. As for the laws, it's the classic pigeon strategy for chess: no matter how good a move your opponent makes, they can't win if you shit all over the board.
I think all of the youth gender care laws will be their undoing. Some will gain traction, i.e. Florida the Madhouse, but as the youth become emboldened to speak about their issues, many parents will listen. I know many of us were not blessed with the experience of understanding parents. But, the younger generations are historically more open-minded, and the same is true of the parents. As more start to listen to their children instead of their congressperson, change will take root. This will be a dark period of our history, but it will be only a period. In the meantime, we just need to continue fighting righteously. A few scared, old guys won't eradicate us so easily.
Them being loud, screaming and flailing about is showing that their ship is finally sinking. The best they can do is scream and cry that trans people are evil and that ""WEelLL youLl alwAye be __*insert birth sex"" as if we don't know. They'll spew the same shit on repeat because they're afraid of people being happy in their bodies. They don't want to respect others because they feel as if by some how acknowledging their identity makes them less of the person that THEY are. I literally just posted saying I was happy about finally being legally identified as male now, and the first and only comment was a trans phobic one (it was automatically deleted thanks to the modding system I think lol). They will only win if we let them wind and for or brothers sisters and siblings we must continue this March of hell. We will never be able to stop fighting, but over decades we will need to fight less. Don't lose hope whether it be for yourself or for others.
Sometimes it feels like they are. The amount of times censored for advocating trans rights lately is really starting to piss me off.
I think currently yes they are ‚Äúwinning‚Äù. The amount of anti trans harassment honesty feels like it‚Äôs increased from this same time last year. And will all the bills getting introduced and some of them passing, they‚Äôre definitely succeeding in their goal. However that doesn‚Äôt mean all hope is gone. We have voices and very loud ones. If we protest our asses off and scream trans rights from the rooftops every chance we get, we have the potential to change things. I mean a lot of people were still very casually racist until the 2020 blm protests happened and it caused a lot of people (myself included) to finally listen to black voices and try to make changes in themselves to change their racist worldviews. 
I know it‚Äôs really scary right now but we can turn that fear into energy that we can use to push back in every way possible
They‚Äôre amping up their transphobic rhetoric because they‚Äôre scared, they‚Äôre worried and they need a new culture war for the next election cycle coming up. Things may get worse before they get better, but things WILL get better.
Republicans and Fox News are coordinating a United hate and smear campaign against trans youth and adults. We need people to sue the government and individual law makers.
[removed]
Yes. The battle. The war? Nope. Death is on our side. Their age will be their end.
no, they most certainly are loud tho
move to Europe Asia or canada tbh
Conservatives fear losing their power. We should try to conserve the earth, not systems of economic oppression and injustice. But no one can win, at least unless this is a game. This is our survival, and politics be damned, we matter. 

That being said, it‚Äôs moments like this where I feel compelled to work from within the bowels of government (all politics are local, to start). In our communities and neighborhoods across the ‚Äúheartland‚Äù: Who is representing us? Who is protecting us? How do we show up for ourselves and each other? 

How do we influence if we can‚Äôt control the narrative?
Well they're passing lots of laws. Republicans get enough power they can totally wipe out a good chunk of trans people.
They are loud, not numerous. I am quite optimistic given the turnout to left-wing protests and demonstrations. In addition to those doing more active things, politically active normies are pretty put-off by the transphobia too. The right has to activate even more of the reactionary non-voters than Trump did in 2016 to make this work long-term.

None of this should be taken as ""we got this, don't worry"", but I think the outlook is not as bleak as it looks at times.
They have already fully lost if enough young people just actually voted. Until turnout for young people is as high as boomers it‚Äôs going to be a tough battle.
> They saw Desantis's victory in Florida in 2022 and figured being transphobic is a winning strategy. And because they are desperate to keep their support, they are doing whatever they can to either force their way into power or change minds by making people afraid of minorities like us.

A little comment to expand on their strategy.

It wasn't that they saw Desantis being transphobic and are copying, its a top down decision. He's being transphobic because the party as a whole has moved to focus on transphobia. They won Roe v Wade which has been a right wing morality/panic motivator for single issue voters for the last 50 years. That issue is gone, and with it, the reason for those voters to show up. At the same time, that's a huge motivator for left wing/democrats to show up. So they need something on the same scale to push that outrage/panic button to evangelicals. Enter Trans people. It's all the fun of the 90s gay panic, but all the ""what about the children"" of the abortion debate. It's a tool for them to move votes. If it works, they'll continue to use it, if not they'll move on to some other hideous scape goat. 

&#x200B;

As for if they're winning? I'm more pessimistic and say they are, at least in their safe spaces. They're winning in territory that they were never going to lose, if that makes sense. They absolutely are not in blue states, and its still a toss up in purple ones. The recent defeats in Virginia are a good showing for democrats though.
Damn, that was beautiful
I know this thread is a little old, but I am a cis woman who is absolutely terrified by all the anti-trans legislation and sentiments that have come out in full force recently. I‚Äôve been reading awful news constantly and came looking for some positive trans news that would maybe lift my spirits about how scary things have gotten, and let me just say, your comment really put my mind to ease a bit. You are absolutely right.

I am saving this comment so when I feel hopeless and helpless, I can remind myself that the LGBTQ+ community and us allies WILL WIN this fight.

All I want is for you guys to be able to exist as you truly are and live peacefully and have the rights all humans deserve. I vow to lift and amplify your voices and to never speak over you. We will win this war. YOU will win this war.
On the comments of every trans or lgbt related video from even left wing media is flooded with hate, at least from what I‚Äôve seen lately
Damn I love well quoted LOTR lines <3
I see your top-tier movie quote and would like to add my favorite quote from the books.

‚ÄúThere, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach‚Äù

I guess it‚Äôs less grand and doesn‚Äôt make a call to action, but I often think of this to remind myself that high beauty exists beyond the storm-cloud-fuckery of the fascists.
Samwise's words of wisdom were the true light when all others went out. Very well placed quote.
We just gotta hold out and wait till all of the transphobes die out! /hj
Ya I think the decider will be if trump gets the presidency
Most gen Xers I know myself included are pretty far left, I'm really hopeful this stuff drops into the grave with the boomers. We never had the numbers until now.
100% agree with this
I remember the 80s and how gay people, men specifically, were targeted by Reagan during the AIDS crisis. in the end, it ended up galvanizing people and public sentiment shifted to a more tolerant view. Being queer is mostly accepted, at least here in the US. It'll work out eventually. We just need to take care of ourselves and our community until that happens.
It‚Äôs a thought, but unfortunately you need money to do that
Its why they wanna raise voting age so they can postpone change. Truly showing their desperation
Unfortunately I do think anti-trans people currently outnumber us. But we can change that. And we will change that. I‚Äôm honestly terrified about everything that‚Äôs happening. But I have hope
Bigots are loudest online but it isn't really an accurate representation of the real world. Most people just want to live and let live
I mean, you're not wrong. LGBT+ acceptance among young people is at an all time high, but that doesn't mean that transphobes can't do damage while they're still here.
Or even Desantis
It's almost assuredly a regional thing then. I'm not sure where your from but i'm in the south east and the Xers here are just mini boomers and the boomers being the stereo typical boomers if not worse.
The concept of marriage equality was impossible to imagine ever happening in this country when I was in high school. The closest thing we had to a successful trans rights movement was going to Rocky Horror once a month. We are nowhere near where we should be, but we are farther than I ever imagined in my lifetime.
trans people need to start saving our own from fascism, we all have to work together in safe countries or at least safer countries from fascism before the night of broken glass American style.
Yeah we just gotta hope that this new generation won't be brainwashed by their bigoted parents and carry on their legacy of ignorance. This generation and really all young people seem to break free from their parents and society's expectations. Every new innovation in society has come from the younger side looking at something, saying ""that's stupid why do we do this or why do we *not* do this and then changing it."" Hopefully this will allow homophobia and transphobia to die out over the next few years.

Came out to my 14yo son	Well, it went better than with anyone else I've come out to, to date being only a few friends and my wife. I'm not certain he fully understands, but he listened and supported me. I asked him if he had any boundaries around me wearing makeup or womens clothing,which he doesn't have as of now, and to talk to me if anything makes him feel uncomfortable or if he has any questions at all. Communication is something he struggles with as is, so I'll be following up regularly, but this is my win for the week.	"That‚Äôs awesome!!! Congratulations
Cool beans
Wow, and congratulations! I‚Äôm terrified of coming out to my 11 year old son, not because he‚Äôs likely to be closed minded, just my own anxieties and fears playing up. 
Please, I must know more! How did you bring it up? Was it emotional? How long were you working up the courage to talk to him? 
Again, congratulations! So happy for you, and this gives me a little more courage to do what I know I have to!
How cool is that?
happy to hear it went relatively 'ok', could always be a lot worse I suppose
Congrats! I‚Äôm glad it went well!
Congratulations !

My son was taunted and harassed by his peers.
I've considered it off and on over the years, but much more intently since he was 13. I've been discussing sexual identification and sexuality for a few weeks now and just told him how I identify in both realms. I explained my history very slightly and my current counseling. No talk of any transition at this point, held off there. My anxiety was ragging, but once we started talking it dissipated quickly.

The Future is Bright	"The 2024 election is nearly 2 years away.

AND EVERY DAY UNTIL THEN A NEW GEN Z WILL TURN 18. 

Statistics show the vast majority of Gen Z is leaning left, while conservative beliefs are dying, and it has got republicans biting their nails.

We saved the midterm elections and canceled the so anticipated ‚Äúred wave.‚Äù 

We will do it again.

We are millions. 


Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm scared for what the next few years will be like. Too much misinformation going unchecked is being fed to people as we speak. And the bigots with offices at the capitol and a voice in congress are not backing down anytime soon. But they are on borrowed time. They know it. They want to introduce every anti-trans/anti LGBT bill while they can. They are using their hatred for us as a campaign strategy and it‚Äôs scary. And if trump, or even worse, desantis were to win the election, we‚Äôd be looking at some very dark years for all kinds of minorities in this country. Specially us. But again, as Gen Z grows, the future ahead is bright. 


I trust Millennials & Gen Z will take over the 2024 election. The racism, the homophobia, the transphobia, all the hatred towards anyone who isn‚Äôt white, cis, straight, and christian in this country isn‚Äôt being hidden by republicans anymore. Their extremism is pushing decent people left. Don‚Äôt get too discouraged by trump‚Äôs latest hateful speech, use it as motivation. We won in 2020, our support is growing, it‚Äôs likely we will do it again."	"I really really hope youre right.
I hope you're right... I really do.

But people keep talking themselves into it not being worth voting.... they did in 2000.  They did it in 2017.

I want to believe.
I really hope so, but I can‚Äôt afford too much hope. My state is really pounding the transphobia hard. Every day seems to get worse. But still, I hope
I agree with you but I want to say that winning elections isn‚Äôt going to do much to fix the damage that‚Äôs already been done. Even if our next president is a democrat I don‚Äôt see things changing much. Our current president is a democrat too and he‚Äôs doing nothing but quietly watching us suffer. We need to be out in the streets protesting and making our voices heard. If there is not a pre existing trans activist group near you then I urge you to start one. Go to local pride events and build a group of people willing to protest whenever they‚Äôre needed. That way whenever you need to protest you have a group of people behind you. You‚Äôre 100% right, we can change things for the better and I have hope in our future. But while voting is a great start, I don‚Äôt think it will do everything. We need to be loud and force them to hear our voices (in a non violent manner)
Don't jinx it
It only looks better if they vote. Overwhelmingly young people do not vote, if they did republicans wouldn‚Äôt have held hardly any offices going back 50 years let alone the past 20. This is how republicans keep office. There is a reason why they gerrymander and and suppress votes, it‚Äôs because they know if they didn‚Äôt they wouldn‚Äôt have held any offices for decades
I don‚Äôt hold this optimism, but I‚Äôm glad someone does. 

With voting rights under attack among many many other things simultaneously under attack - I feel these next elections will be stolen and there won‚Äôt be Jack shit we can do about it.
Now all y'all Millennials and Gen Zed gotta get out and vote.

Vote like our lives depend on it, because they probably will...
Honestly I know Zoomers get shit on a lot for being cringey but they are way better than my generation. Overall y'all are so much more open and accepting of other people and way more willing to callout the bullshit. Hopefully the combined might of Zoomers and Millennials will  finally be enough to put the boomer hegemony to rest.

I do hope this swan song of conservatism,  I was encouraged by mid-term results because it looks like all that investing in Transphobic culture war bullshit really didn't end up paying dividends for them in any meaningful way. I think most cishet voters just don't care about Trans people like that especially when it seems like everything is falling apart post pandemic but who knows something could happen before now and 2024 that sinks their chances further or boosts them up.

I also don't think DeSadist beats Trump in the primary, DeathSantis has like negative charisma and as soon as they debate I think Trump will pull his card and all the smaller candidates will also kind of take from away DeStupid. I do think he has a better shot at Biden but again Biden washes him because like Trump, Biden is way more likeable and once they start going into his record as governor, his politics and his less than reputable past I think voters will be turned off because again he has all the charm of a sea urchin being jammed in your taint.
Young people have been the fire for every social justice movement 

The Black Power movement? a 15 year old girl (Claudette Colvin) inspired the protest resulting in Rosa Parks arrest

I do think Gen Z is special, but every previous generation hopes the new generation will turn the tide. We cant forget about those whove been working for liberation for decades, or put all the work onto Gen Z

EDIT our community is tough as hell and we will persevere like we always have, but we will need every generation to join the fight
I like it; feels like hope. üíó
No it is not
[removed]
Things weren‚Äôt this horrible in 2016/2017. Trust.
Presidential elections usually get a lot more people voting than anything else, and if the last midterm was anything to go by then we have reason to hope.
Republicans are sure preparing to suppress votes. But Democrats are preparing to not let that happen. We have wonderful people fighting for our rights in congress, AOC currently taking the lead on that as her influence on the media grows!
Do you think Biden will run again? I personally don‚Äôt think so. He‚Äôs too old. I do see Kamala running for president, she‚Äôs already doing a good job as vice president. I can see her becoming the first woman to be president of the US.
I genuinely think it can be if we try. I know things are very bad right now and honestly I think it‚Äôs going to get a lot worse. But we do have the power to be loud and fight for our rights. If we just give up then they‚Äôre definitely going to win. But if we fight, at least we have a chance
So what you‚Äôre trying to say is that democrats are the true fascists trying to commit genocide because people in cities sometimes do hate crimes?

What?
What are you saying? I‚Äôm legitimately not clear what you‚Äôre even arguing.
No, not really. We have people fighting for us. Groups like the ACLU. But we don‚Äôt have support in congress or the federal government. We don‚Äôt. 

I seriously doubt democrats will have a spine for this either. 100+ voted to ‚Äúcondemn‚Äù socialism. Whatever their term ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù means currently. 

Democrats aren‚Äôt out saviors. They‚Äôre just the best we have.
I don't think anybody in Biden's cabinet would have a shot tbh. I think Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan would be a really good candidate if Biden doesn't run, she at least seems like an establishment Dem who isn't afraid to stand up to the right, I think her government's response to her kidnapping plot was way better than Biden's was to Jan 6. Gavin Newsom from Cali might also be good but he has some baggage.

As a leftist my dream would be for Daddy Bernie to run again and win. I hope he does run at the very least to push the other candidates left but he is as old as Biden so I'm not sure how voters would respond. He might run the 3rd time and people be like ""We've tried everybody else at this point"" and win off that and all the Gen Z voters coming in for 2024. But that is a bit fantastical I admit.
[removed]
The #1 thing we need to focus on is voting. Getting people to vote. Fighting/blocking voter suppression. Forget everything else. Voting. That‚Äôs it.
AOC would be my dream. She leads with LOVE and education. I just read a presidential candidate needs to be 35, she‚Äôs 33 right now so in two years she‚Äôd be perfect.
Wow. Okay. How do you feel about your party actively trying to destroy the rights of trans people?
You‚Äôre a silly goose.
I think it has to do with as people age and accumulate wealth they are more likely to be conservative bc of the conservative talking points about those brown people who wanna take all your hard earned dollars away

A Transgender's Texas Teacher	" 

By now I am pretty sure most of you have heard about what the hypocritical and cowardly governor of Texas has enacted for our state. And yes like most of you I am angry beyond measure as this is not an attack on me, but an attack on children whose only crime is attempting to be happy. Believe me I grew up in a world where it could have been dangerous to be any kind of non conforming and I did not come out till my 30's, even now as I am in the process of transition, I comfortably hide in the closet as long as I can.

But the more I think about what is going on I have to think why is this going on now why has this become his cause, because he is scared. Remember in the last election Texas came closer to being blue since I was a small kid. The blue strongholds, traditionally Dallas and Austin, are spreading. More and more democrats are moving into the state and they are gaining power. And if you actually look at the breakdown of party affiliation, dems outnumber republicans, as of the last census 39% rep 40% dem.   Granted the problems come in as all these dems are located in the same place.  g 

Every day for the last year I have had to drive by Trump protesters flying the confederate flag, flags with Trump's name plastered on them, and some other inane racist or sexist rant plastered on them. and every time this filled me with disgust and rage, then i realized what it actually means. they're scared.

Our hypocritical governor is scared, Cancun Cruz is scared, Rick Perry who, besides starting this new transgender issue, has been spending his free time from being our attorney genial fighting criminal charges, including stealing a very expensive pen, and those protesters are scared.

We have Bato running for Governor, who is our Bernie Sanders, except he's young. We have Matthew McConaughey running for governor, and I'm choosing to believe that's a good thing. Even among Republicans, Abbot is facing a serious threat from Huffines, who would make Abbot look like Kermit the Frog.

For the first time since the 90's Texas has a real chance of sending a Dem to the senate and Seating a Dem in Austin. All this abortion stuff and transgender B.S. and all of it, is them running scared.

Though it means that those children will suffer and that people will have real harm from these individuals' fear and that is not right. That shows that these people do not care about those they were elected to protect.

I can not speak for every single teacher in Texas but I know my classroom will always be a safe haven for those who wish to find themselves and I have never worked with a teacher who does not feel the same way. We learned about this during a math meeting today and the rage that us math nerds were able to raise was quite shocking.

It is going to be a long hard road for many people, but if people start fleeing the state the Reds win. If people keep hiding in the closet then the conservatives win. If people keep saying it will be ok in the end it won't be. Abbot can still win this one and that was his goal in this, but I think us Texas need to do what we do best.  Say screw you to someone pissing us off,  we don't complain we punch someone we don't are the descendants of the people American and Mexico kicked out.  

I have for some time now put off coming out at work while I transition. All this has shown me that I can not put this off any more. Over the next few weeks I will be publicly coming and in my personal life I will become the real me.   because it needs to be done.  If I can be a help for even one person I have been successful and that is what we all need to do.    We need to stand together with Democrats, people who think that one should not punish children because of their religious beliefs, we need to stand together and tell them we won't let this happen. 

Don't run from the state, make this state one people will run to.  

TL/DR 

Texas is in more trouble now than in a long time. It is not the time to run, it is the time to stand strong against Abbot and his ilk and we can do it together."	"I agree. We will never go away and they can try but they dont have the power to stop us, there will always be more trans people because being trans is not a choice. Being a shithole worthless human parasite is a choice tho. I will fight tooth and nail for myself and any trans person.

If you read the name ‚ÄúRylan‚Äù what gender would you assume?	"Edit 2: (pronounced like ‚ÄúRyan‚Äù but with an L; Rye-Lan) probably should put that in to begin with but just so everyone knows lol

[deleted]
It sounds very masculine to me
How interesting. With zero contextual clues, I'd honestly say it's one of the most either/or name I've ever come across; could completely work for male, female, or non-binary.
seems gender-neutral to me
I‚Äôm a fan of Project: Hail Mary, so I associate it with the masc side of things.
from my perspective it's about as neutral as you can get
non-binary haha
Non-binary
I try not to assume but if I had to, I would think it‚Äôs a guy‚Äôs name specifically because I know several guys named Ryan, but it is definitely gender-neutral!
Seems masc to me
Non-binary
Male, had a cis classmate with that name
It feels like it could be either but it also feels kinda southern...
Male. Like rylan clark
I wouldn‚Äôt
Someone typoed Ryan?
Trans masc in general. So masc nonbinary and trans guys
I knew a lesbian named Rylan, so that probably makes me a little biased
Androgynous..?
Gives Neutral vibes, maybe a bit on the masculine side
Well first I wouldn't even clock a gender because I would be going

""What the fuck is that? Rillin???""

and then I would remember Ryland Steelcatcher and go ""***RYLAND!!***"" in a Rytlock voice that I can't actually make aloud, and assume that it's a guy.
Unsure
None. Busy playing The National's song with the same name in my head whenever I hear it.
Intriguingly, my gut feeling is feminine, but the only Rylan I've ever met was a cis guy.
i would immediately think of a whiny toddler. but if it's any comfort, it'd be a male whiny toddler. rylan just seems like a name that a mom would be yelling all the time ngl.
It sounds like it could be either or to me, I like it.
Masc person
I would say it's a Male name.
Female
Hmmmmm

I would say a masculine feminine name. Like, it could go either way. I woukd lean more feminine, but would hold zero surprise if they were a boy.

Regardless that name is hella pretty.
Male but to me it feels like it‚Äôs almost the new version of Bentley. Like there will probably be about 15 kids in the same grade with the same name.
Reads masculine to me
Male
Gender Neutral with a hint of Masculinity
Neutral
Male, but of the whiter than Wonderbread suburbanite variety.
Non-binary
my first thought was non binary/gender neutral but if i had to pick male or female, i‚Äôd say male
Masc, but I also have a brother named Ryan so I'm probably biased
Sounds like a masc name to me, but I‚Äôm biased as I was friends with a Rylan in my teens who was male.
Sounds gender neutral to me tbh.
girl name
Feels Masc to me
Masc name to me but I could see it being gender neutral.
seems like a guy name imo because it reminds me of ryan a little
like a baffling mixture of ryan and dylan. would you pronounce it RY-lin or RILL-in?? i think RY-lin sounds more fem to me and RILL-in sounds more masc, but just reading it my brain kinda short-circuits
Honestly agender-masc. masc bc it looks like Dylan, agender bc it also looks like R‚Äôlyeh, a very eldritch and voidpunk name to have
I read it as almost rye-lin and I'd say feminine
I would think of trans fem. I can see how it could be a masculine name but it seems very feminine to me.
Depends on the accent and how you said it
Masculine. One of my male cousins name is Rylan, so I naturally associate it with masculinity. üôÉ
Masculine.  I actually know a Rylan, he's super nice.
i know a bunch of girls named rylan and i know a couple boys, id say its rarer for boys but its pretty unisex imo:)
I would assume feminine/woman. I have an acquaintance with a similarly spelled name pronounced RIE- luhn.
idk, vaguely male? Could work for any gender tho
Maculine name, would assume male or nonbinary.
Honestly, I've never encountered it before. I think it is androgynous, maybe slightly male-leaning on the basis of spelling (it reminds me of Dylan). It could, however, swing either way, depending on how it is pronounced, in my opinion.
it sounds pretty neutral? It reminds my of ""Riley"" and ""Dylan"". Though ""Ryan"" should come to mind, Riley came first idk why lol.
Male, but only because I had an old friend named Rylan, she's ironically mtf like me, her name is Lynnette now

Lynette if you see this, ily üòò
Male
Very in the middle for me, but maybe leaning ever so slightly towards masc.
Feminine to me.
Suburban. 

Jk, it's pretty gender neutral but like masc-leaning I feel like.
Masc
Male? It seems quite masculine (although it could be gender neutral)
I would assume man. But mainly because of being unfortunately aware of Shane Dawson‚Äôs fianc√©
Definitely androgynous, but it I had to guess I suppose more male especially if it rhymes with Dylan
Masc with super pretentious parents
I think it‚Äôs masc because there is a celebrity in the uk with that name who is a guy
Non binary, my friend said boy
Yo my best friend when I was 4 was named rylan and for that reason, I gotta say male gender
gurl
Masc
Masc or Non binary
Sounds like a mix between Dylan and Ryan. Both are masculine names, so yeah
It seems pretty masculine to me. Could potentially work for any gender though

Just on first impressions it seems masc.
i'd assume male, but i wouldn't be that suprised if it was a girl.
masculine, feels like a mix of ryan and dylan, at least in my opinion
Mass/ non-binary but more masc presenting.
Male. I personally only know a cis guy with that name so it‚Äôs kinda what I default to.
I can only think of Rylan Clarke-Neil so ima say male
Girl üëß
To be honest? 

Really none

Starting to read I thought: definitely feminie

Continuing to read: Wait what?

I am as confused as my sexuality üòÖ
no clue i‚Äôve known a male and female rylan
Sounds like an unisex name
Male
Non-binary
Initially masc, then enby? I confused it for Ryan at first üòÖ
the name Rylan is a gender of it‚Äôs own
Sounds unisex to me. Like Riley or Ryan.
I've only known girls by that name so to me it seems feminine. I feel biased in saying this.
Trans boy name. Emphasis on trans.
I know a little girl by that name.
Girl
Girl that works at the deli at the loca grocery store, Tennessee/Alabama/Georgia, dad owns a fishing boat and a roofing business, she dates on again off again boyfriend brayden, they will get pregnant next year; she always puts too much paprika in the potato salad according to the deli manager Kim who also accuses her of needing to be ‚Äúbrung down a peg‚Äù.

She went to church with a friend just once for a super bowl party and technically ‚Äúgot saved‚Äù and also won a DVD player in the raffle
Mostly masc but wouldn‚Äôt be shocked at meeting girls or fem people with the name. Probably because it‚Äôs similar to Dylan, I think of it as a masc name but know girls called Dylan
Knew a cis guy at my old dojo with the name, its masc to me
I've met people of various genders with that name. But my brain just thinks of a land of bread.
Seems masc but I could see both sides
I get masculine vibes
Enby-androgynous to Enby-masculine in my personal opinion.
That‚Äôs a guys name or if I heard it I‚Äôd assume that. I‚Äôve not met very many people named Rylan except I think in elementary he was cool
Woman probably. But could see it as either. It‚Äôs pretty androgynous overall
Seems NB to me.
It is ambiguous enough that I wouldn't assume one way or the other, but if you forced me to guess I'd have guessed masc because it's basically ""Dylan"" but with a different letter, and all the Dylans I know are guys.
fem was my initial sense about it but I do also think it can be androgynous
Masc
Masc. Sounds like a mix between Ryker and Dylan.
Unisex. I wouldn‚Äôt hazard a guess either way based on that name. I like it tho, and think I‚Äôd like it for anyone
I find it very interesting that you say it‚Äôs one like Oliver and such because I‚Äôve never met anyone with the name Rylan. It‚Äôs kinda shocking to see that it‚Äôs a lot more common of a thing than I thought lol
This
Doctor Ryland Grace did not even remotely strike me as a masculine name ngl

my university deadnamed me in a professional induction ceremony‚Äînow i‚Äôm mad.	"tw // deadnaming

hello all!! last semester, the university of south carolina aiken held their induction ceremony for the school of education‚Äôs professional program. i was deadnamed in front of my peers, my professors, and the administration. i was blatantly lied to about the reasoning for it, and though they asked for suggestions on
how to prevent it from happening again, no changes have been made. i have checked. religiously.

today i decided to take to social media about it, since obviously the university isn‚Äôt doing anything on their own. i know it‚Äôs not much, and i understand the impact it could have on me, but i am so tired. between this, the open bigotry of some of the students and faculty and the school newspaper making a joke out of accommodations for disabled students for april fools, i am tired.

it feels like a win, speaking up about it‚Äîeven within my small circles on facebook and twitter. i‚Äôm not hopeful that anything will be done, but i do want people to be aware of how little this school seems to care about trans students.

hope everyone has a fantastic day. you‚Äôre all loved, you‚Äôre all amazing, and i am proud of you üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

I'm really sorry about that. Sounds like it's not a very progressive college... Which you would kinda hope it would be considering it's ""teaching the next generation"" and all that.
Hey, I went to Clemson, and can honestly say this is the reason I avoided going to graduation - I didn't want to be needlessly deadnamed in front of my peers. Even though I updated my name in their system, all of my teachers still saw me as my deadname, so I had to get deadnamed on the role until they learned my name. SC schools are horrible about this, despite a few individuals being supportive. Just know you aren't alone. Call the shit out when you see it, we need brave people like you.
this is something i‚Äôm very interested in doing soon, if i can find a paper willing to do it!! tysm for the suggestion ‚ô•Ô∏è

I think I finally understand why pride is so important.	"Back in the Before Times - both before the plague and my cracking - I didn't really understand why Pride was still a thing.  Human decency had *won* - or so it seemed to me when I was too wrapped up in my own nonsense to notice the mountains of evidence to the contrary.  I'd still always intended to go to one just to see what they were about, you know, *as an ally*, but never got around to it, and then they were cancelled two years in a row.  I guess it is fitting that my first Pride at all was my first Pride as myself.

The festival itself is, I'm sad to say, not for me.  I was lousy in noisy crowds before the plague gave me a reason to be nervous, and I've *never* managed to enjoy live music.  Still, it was worth attending, even if it did result in several unasked for sermons and pamphlets explaining that I'm a hell bound monster.  Actually that might have been my favorite part.  When a shy youngster shoved the first hateful pamphlet in my hand, I was a bit confused - until I read it.  I was of two minds about it:  that this kind of thing *actually* happens, and, also, that it was one of the most absurdly useless gestures I've ever seen in my life.  Everyone in front of me glanced at the pamphlet and tossed it in a bin seemingly places for that exact purpose.  A few different people were preaching and more or less following the same script.  A cursory exploration of who the hell they were was enough to learn that they'd traveled a few hundred miles to be there.  On my way out I advised that they need a better hobby which was as usefully received as their own sermons were.

The parade, though...I'd not intended to ever march in a parade ever again if I could help it since the army had informed me that parades are miserable affairs.  But with coming out, I've also become something of an activist.  I didn't intend for that to happen, it's just that once I started paying attention, I realized that human decency hadn't won.  To that end, I signed up to march with my local Planned Parenthood chapter.  I ended up having to speed walk more than a mile having utterly misjudged just how long it'd take to get from the festival to the parade route, but made it just before the starting whistles sounded. 

I now know how Caesar must have felt during one of his Triumphs.  Behind me was a hateful capital I've spent many weekends at in service of one cause or another, every time feeling as if I might as well argue with the marble itself for all the good I was doing.  But Saturday I saw something else:  hundreds of thousands of people *cheering* for people like me.  Hundreds of thousands of people who, for whatever reason, decided that they wanted to spend a hot-ass evening packed shoulder to shoulder while a few thousand people like walked by, waving our little plastic flags and rainbow lights.  (It being approximately ten thousand degrees, I opted to wave my giant plastic trans fan instead.)  For a person with my particular eccentricities, it was akin to trying to fill a bucket at the base of niagra falls, and yet in spite of the fact that overwhelming is an understatement if ever there was one, somehow I wasn't overwhelmed.

Somewhere near the middle of the parade route I noticed a few people with signs offering hugs from a mom or a dad.  One of them had come from just as far away as the preacher had.  I burst into tears at that, though I'm not sure anyone noticed since I was drenched in sweat.  Three or four complete jackasses had driven across the state to be absolute bastards, and here were dozens of people who'd driven across the state to offer someone a hug.

For an hour, I felt like an absolute super hero.  For an hour, I thought that maybe decency would win so long as people like me are still willing to go scream at marble and take a nice long walk down the street.  For an hour, I was reminded that most people aren't bastards, and that we're not alone in this.  In that hour, I finally *understood* why pride is so important.

I also got a free shirt."	"Damn, your writing is captivating. Thx for sharing OP.
There was a pride event down in Toledo  This past weekend that I felt bad about missing.  Turns out i have covid, but i really need to get to one
It has its place. But I find it so so cringey how Pride has generally forgotten its origins. Where I live, transphobes and political parties oppossed to transfolks do the parade. And nobody adresses the racism either.

Its a hollow thing for me. I don't attend. Because Im a contrarian and because my empire of dirt doesn't build itself.
Thank you your writing and details are so inspiring, I will have to push through my anxiety and go to pride one day. Never ever planned on going until now, hopefully I can and I feel safe enough to in my city üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüíû
This is really cool, thanks for sharing.
I can certainly understand that perspective.  There was plenty of corporate sponsorship, and I'm under no illusions about just how mercenary that is.  While my own natural inclination trends toward cynicism, I won't yield to it on this point.  Yes, it is mercenary and, as such, utterly amoral.  That sponsorship happens because it is profitable to do so.  It is entirely devoid of noble intent.  I know that this sound like a cynical view, but hiding within that observation is a point:  it is *profitable* to be accepting.

Think about what that means for a moment.  It wasn't all that long ago that the only sponsorship such an event could hope for was from queer organizations.  It was not so long ago that non-queer brands would distance themselves from it entirely.  It was not so long ago that pride had to be true to its roots in a riot, when it was an act of desperate *defiance*.  And now pride is brought to you by Apple, by Verizon, by Indeed - because now it makes business sense to do so.  Because being queer is less radical.  Because you no longer need to gird yourself for a street fight.  It was a festival - a celebration, and the parade was a triumph, not a march to battle.  It is proof that progress is being made.

And that I at last saw why it still exists in spite of corporate sponsorship, in spite of losing its teeth, is proof that there is still progress to be made.
The first time I went to a protest, every fiber of my being protested.  The law didn't affect me.  I didn't know a single trans kid whose life was going to be made harder.  I was entirely convinced that I'd be one of the only people who cared.  And yet, if not me - a person who was so steeped in transphobia, who was so injured as a child that I was only able to discover my truth because of an epoch-ending plague - then *who*?

The same went for Pride.  I thought that maybe I'm not queer enough, not trans enough.  That I was an imposter.  That I, as evidenced by not understanding why such events still happened, had no right to it.  But if I, after a year of HRT, after so many soul-scouring nights, after coming out again, and again, and again, don't have a place at pride, who would?  And I certainly have fair reason to fear that some maniac would do something terrible.  Am I to let such a miserable person raging at what they don't understand ruin the possibility of a better future for myself.  Am I to yield the field to them without ever showing up?

I can't grant you courage because such a thing isn't transferable even if I had any of my own.  All I can say is what I always say every time I can bring myself to answer a question of ""how do I find the courage to do *whatever*: you don't.  Or at least I didn't.  There is no one who can march for me or celebrate for me, or defend me *except me*.  However long the odds, the only thing I can do is try and risk failure, or do nothing and fail all the same."	wv2onv	trans	67	0.95	2022-08-22 19:26:04

I use to work in a call centre and i use to Very Often get called a female / women on the phone.

At the time i use to absolutely hate it and would often bring attention to it with my colleagues, who found it funny or the such.

For ages I wished i had a more deeper more manly voice, but now i look back at it and wonder if i drew attention to it due to some sub concise desire.

I also wonder if i hated it so much as i was ‚Äúpushing back‚Äù on my subconscious internal trans fears. I recently started to question if i am trans, and now look back at this with more curiosity of how i would react now if it was to occur.
I had similar feelings about myself, before realizing I'm trans. üòÑ

Costa Rica's top court rules gay marriage ban is unconstitutional - decision seen as win for gay rights activists and welcomed by the country's new president		"Costa Rican transbian here. We LGBTIQA+ folks don't see this as a win. Even if they ruled the ban unconstitutional, they didn't approve gay marriage. In an unprecedented display of inconsistency and cowardice, they passed the bucket to our mostly conservative legislators.

They will be given 18 months to change the current legislation to allow gay marriage. If they default, the parts of the current legislation enabling the ban will become void.

However, these 18 months start running as of the official publication of the ruling, which has no deadline. To make matters worse, the president has just submitted another bill to legislators‚Äîone that would create a parallel marital status conferring roughly the same state protection as marriage, just not actually called ""marriage"".

Got misgendered in a good way?	"Was in the bank to change my name. Said i was trans and had legally changed my name so i needed to update my details. They were cool about it but they said a few things that seemed odd. Like they mentioned how they thought you had to change and stuff before you could change your name. 

This confused me since iv been on T for a while and more often then not i dont get misgendered. Anyway i didnt put much thought into it since afterwards they brushed it off saying things are different for everyone and saying how brave i was and all the other stuff that follows.

Then came the name change, now it was her turn to be confused.
Turns out she thought i was a cis male transitioning to a female. 

Gotta admit i was pretty cuffed about this, to me it meant i was passing. I was telling my sister about it and she spun it a different way.

To me that definitely means they though you were a pre-transition MTF.

Oh pfftt no doubt they thought you were male to female. I don‚Äôt know how your sister could see it as anything else, but whatever. Rock this my guy, that‚Äôs pretty damn awesome you‚Äôre passing so well!

I'm scared of myself and don't know if I'll ever be able to change it	"TW: Suicide

Hi. Sorry if this is a bit too much, I just need to vent. It also ended up being longer than I expected.

In September I started exploring my gender identity. I realized that I'm trans and the reason I hate myself isn't just growing up. It took me a while to come to terms with it, but when shit got really bad in October I came out accidentally to my friends, which turned out to be the best decision I could make. They were very supportive and encouraged me to come out to my parents when I'm ready. I did so in January. It didn't go as I planned. Before I got to the point, I ended up breaking down with parents asking me to tell them what's wrong. I had the worst panic attack yet and I felt like my life was about to get ruined. I ended up only telling them I have problems figuring out my gender identity, even though I knew perfectly well who I was at the time. They kept telling me it's normal, that everyone has these thoughts while growing up and that it's super common for kids to feel like this these days. They did let me see a therapist, though. I met her once so far, I'm seeing her again next week. Turns out she's a wonderful person that genuinely tries to help me. She did say she isn't very exerienced with the trans stuff though, so after the next meeting I'll be changing the therapist to someone she recommended who could not only understand me better, but also actually help. Everything seems great, doesn't it? Well, here's when everything goes to shit. I was going with my parents on a two week trip. Which means I lost contact with my only accepting friends for two whole weeks. I was worried it'd take a toll on me, and it did. After whole days of constant misgendering, talking to my friends was the only thing that could bring me joy. And since it was gone, it fucked me up pretty quickly. I started self harming. I didn't want to cut myself, because my parents would find out. So I started burning myself with a dryer, as that was easier to hide and explain. And then, when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I won some fucking competition. And it wasn't just a random school thing, it was a very big competition I didn't think I would win. But I wasn't happy. In a few months I'll be going to a trip abroad with my teacher to receive some award. He also told me I could be contacted by media of all things. So now I'm the center of attention for my family, school, and classmates, but I don't want that. I just want to be left alone, especially since I'm not publically out yet. So instead of being happy, I'm suicidal because everybody keeps congratulating me what a talented boy I am. And you know what's the worst? My parents keep telling me how proud they are of me, and yet they can't respect the only thing I asked them. They keep telling me how handsome I am, despite me telling them I hate that. They keep trying to get me some more manly clothes, despite me telling them I want to dress in a more feminine way. It's like they only care about my achievements, but don't respect me as a person. They also keep insisting it's just a phase and I would be happier if I ate better, as if my eating disorders weren't caused by my self image. And I just can't take it anymore. My parents keep trying to make me someone I'm not, and they don't even try to understand why that's an issue. Every day I keep thinking of ending myself, but I can't because I know how much it'd hurt my friends and my family. So I just keep self harming, both physically and mentally by asking people to insult me online. Why? Why do I keep doing shit that only makes me feel worse? Why instead of trying to be happy, I keep making myself more and more miserable? I can function perfectly well and nobody suspects anything is wrong, but I just don't want to be alive. Why is that happening? I'm tired of hating myself, I want to be normal, but it isn't possible because I was born in a wrong body. And it's so unfair, whatever I do feels wrong, I can't even look at my arms without feeling hatred towards myself. I hardly ever speak as I can't listen to myself. And I can't even change that without exposing myself to extreme hatred in a pretty conservative area. I don't know what to do anymore, it's like I'm stuck in a never ending loop of self hatred, punishment and guilt for being a wreck. I just wish there was someone to hug me and actually listen to me."	"Hi you beautiful girl. It makes me sad that your parents are trying to force you to be someone that you are not. I want you to know that they are the ones who are wrong here, you are right. Being true to yourself is always the best thing you can do. You don't owe them anything. I am a mom and reading about your parents makes my blood boil! I'm trying not to go on a rant here, but bad words keep coming up in my mind right now!

It also makes me sad that you are hurting yourself and have all this dark thoughts in your mind. Please talk to your therapist about this, my brave girl. If you don't want to do that, there is this really good organisation focused on LGTB+ people you can contact 24/7!

You are of course welcome to contact me also, but I'm just a mom that want every kid and young person to be safe and loved for how they are, not an expert on what you are going through. But if you need mom support I'm here for you.

Baby girl you are beautiful and if they can't see that then it's their loss. If you're parents aren't supportive then you're just going to have to fake it till you make it. I understand where you're coming from and from my experience all the self destructive behavior that I had before coming out as trans and publicly presenting have all disappeared. Like you I couldn't stop and it felt like an addiction but as soon as I started presenting those urges went away and now I'm thankful that I survived or didn't get arrested. You will be 18 soon and legally an adult capable of making your own decisions in the mean time set yourself the goal of making a future for yourself. Get a job, save every penny you can, start applying for scholarships if collage or technical trad schools are in your future. Make a plan for moving out and be prepared for any support you are receiving from family to disappear. You will have to adopt the mindset of your going to have to do this alone. You won't be alone, you will get friends who will support you emotionally at least if not financially. There is light at the end of the tunnel your in just keep moving.
I love you and want you to keep fighting for who you are.  DM me if you ever want to talk.

ü•∞‚ù§
you should flat out tell your parents what you need from them thats the only way to have change also you are a wonderful person who deserves the best, i have gone down the self harm rabbit hole it doesnt end well and its not worth it.
Oh gosh. I can relate a lot to this. I came out the same way to my parents - I had a panic attack before I was ready to tell them and they took it very poorly. They truly think I have ""confusion"" and think its linked to me having Autism Spectrum Disorder (which for some inexplicable reason they didn't tell me until a few weeks ago. I'm 21 mind you and never had this diagnosed or treated). I'm going to see therapy now and meeting with two separate therapists this week who are experienced in this kind of stuff. I'm in college on the other side of the country and all my friends here know and are ultra supportive of me.

&#x200B;

I am going home for a week in March and I'm extremely nervous about it. My parents actively refuse my pronouns (they/them) and I'm worried about how they will take things going forward. I'm going to a third therapist when I get home at my parent's request, this is my mom's therapist. She is not experienced in queer issues and my mom brought me up to her and she told her that I was just confused and that my gender questioning is due to me having ASD. She doesn't know me so maybe getting to talk to her one on one will change her perspective. 

&#x200B;

Stick with it, we're in this together. You are awesome and just know that your achievements and your gender are not linked. Be proud of yourself. I can relate to this too because I'm an engineering major with a high GPA currently looking to grad school, so my parents keep telling me how proud they are of me and I am the center of attention to a lot of my family when I kind of wish my parents would be a little more hands off sometimes. One thing I'd totally recommend is after your next couple therapy sessions have your therapist talk to your parents so they can get an outside and professional perspective. They think they know you better than you know yourself. A therapist is an outside and unbiased source so they are able to read you, and as such, your parents might be willing to take it from them. 

&#x200B;

Enjoy your trip, you deserve it. And we're all right here if you need someone to talk to or vent to. Also go on the Discord for this subreddit if you ever need someone to vent to in real time.
Thank you! I might've been too hard on my parents, though. I really love them and they love me, they just don't understand. They are trying to support me, but at the same time it feels like they don't want to see me for who I am. In their eyes I'm their son who's confused by puberty. And I can't really blame them, nobody would want their child to be trans. I just wish they didn't insist I'm in the wrong so much.
Thanks. Don't worry about me, I'm careful. I really wish I could help myself, but whenever I tell myself I'd stop I do it later anyway. It feels like an addiciton, but it doesn't even make me feel good. I really don't understand it
Thank you. My parents don't believe me, but they really want to help. It's just that I can't explain it to them, because they always act like they know better and I'm just confused. They mean well, but they aren't exactly the best at it. I hope they'll change their mind one day, I really don't want to cut ties with them
I know I should, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I'm scared I might panic again and only worsen the situation. Just like before, I couldn't even argue with them because I didn't want to talk in the first place. I'm waiting for my second therapist appointment next week, maybe that will help somehow, but I really don't know anymore.

start slow then one thing at a time like trying not to self harm its hard to stop but feels good when you do
I don't know. The first time I came out to them I couldn't even speak properly. Maybe they would accept me, but I'm scared of what will happen if they don't. As it is now it sucks, but at least they're trying to help, even if they don't understand
Are you sure? I don't want to be a burden
I really wish I could, but it feels impossible. I can convince myself that's wrong, but later I'll do it anyway.

Sometimes wins turn into loses...	Went and got blood tests today because I got back to see the endocrinologist next week and they updated all my information in their system, changing my name to my chosen name and my gender to female. Excitedly told my somewhat supportive family and my dad replied telling me I'll always be \[Deadname\] to him and that I'll always be his son and that I should be put on Testosterone, not Estrogen. But hey, at least strangers are supportive.	"I am so sorry, just remember that you will always have a group of people supporting you! <3
Wow, what an asshole. Sorry that happened to you.
girl, fuck him. he doesn't deserve a beautiful, gorgeous, stunning daughter like you,that has an amazing personality. just ignore him,he can go suck his own cock,, you are valid as fuck and you deserve to be happy üíï
Thats messed up of him to say, im sorry. I hope he can realize that and apologize one day. Congrats to you for being yourself
Hopefully one day he will accept you as who you are, things can be hard but for many of us we choose to stay adamant and focused on our goals. You can do it, never loose sight of what makes you happy, and if you happen to catch that happiness. 

Please tell us too
And that's why I'm not on speaking terms with my parents.
I'm not too far off from that honestly, once I move out that'll probably be it, it's just a matter of being able to move out
I totally understand. In many ways I was lucky coming out at 35 because I've been independent for a while."	nkp2lt	trans	45	0.92	2021-05-25 12:54:48
Supportive parents (us) of trans daughter need advice/resources for talking to very likely non-supportive extended family (religious sisters/mom/nieces etc)	"Hello r/trans. First and foremost, thank you for being such a beacon of light and learning in a murky world for new-ish trans parents. So wonderful to see all the love and support and sometimes heartbreaking to see that support is not universal. 

Our 22 y/o daughter came out to us middle of 2020. We were blindsided but supportive from the start. We have a trans niece who transitioned 4 years prior who we are close to so we at least has a road map and supportive people we love who had gone before us. Huge help. 

We have honored our daughter‚Äôs wishes to allowed her space as she figured it out as far as telling my side of the family (they are fundy religious and Trumpy-maybe even more ‚ÄúPence-y‚Äù). Now she‚Äôs ready and does not care who knows or what they have to say about it. We are in the same place so it‚Äôs time. 

I told one sister/BIL in person a few weeks ago when we were together. While it did not go horrifically bad, it certainly was not great. Looking back, I feel like we ambushed them by not providing any context or soft place to land if they needed a moment to understand what they were hearing. They were shocked and said basically everything you are not supposed to say lol. Things settled down and they said they still loved ‚Äúhe/she/whatever we are supposed to say‚Äù. We will take that as a win with this group lol. 

We have always wanted to have these conversations face-to-face as we know we have nothing to hide or be ashamed of. However, having that last experience under our belt, we now see that it may not be fair to  just lay this on someone who has no idea it is coming. Especially knowing They have strong religious beliefs about this and hear about it/talk about it in church, and likely the media they consume as well. That said, they know we do not share those views and we have a generally loving/supportive family dynamic (with guardrails lol). This will be a huge bombshell though and will likely rip the guardrails right out of the ground- at least for a while. 

So our thought is to send a group email with some links to resources that may at least give them a little space to digest then set up a zoom chat with each family with our daughter over the coming weeks to ‚Äúget it all out there‚Äù in small groups.  Then perhaps set up small in-person introduction to their new niece gathering/dinner for those who are ready 

I know ‚Äúgoogle is my friend‚Äù and all that but I would really appreciate some advice and help from those who have gone before us. 

Thanks and much love"	"You‚Äôre doing your best and seem like really supportive parents, especially coming here to ask for advice. A group email is a great first step, where you can include resources so that your family can educate themselves.

My first thought here re: the zoom chats is that‚Äôs a lot of emotional labour, explaining, being put on the spot for your daughter. Has your daughter said she is comfortable with this? Her comfort should come first during this coming out process and it sounds like she just wants people to know and they deal with their feelings themselves. She‚Äôs lucky to have you and I bet that‚Äôs really important to her!

If it helps - I (nonbinary) did a social media post about eight months ago, talking about my name, pronouns and that I had started testosterone. I knew all my family would see it and didn‚Äôt want to have to have in person conversations with them. Some asked questions, some messaged me privately, some spoke to my mom, others are definitely still processing and in denial aha. I was able to do this because my mom is really supportive and I only ever needed her ‚Äúapproval,‚Äù which I got by casually telling her I was going to start hormones over the phone (it was a hard thing to say at first because I was worried about losing her but she‚Äôs still here and she is trying her best to understand and figure things out like you).

My mom is the one I explain everything I am able to in regards to how I‚Äôm feeling and what changes are coming. My family are religious and old fashioned and I just don‚Äôt have the energy for those conversations anymore. I can‚Äôt imagine going through meetings with all my family members to answer the same questions again and again when they have the resources and can talk amongst themselves. I hope this helps!
First off, great parenting.  A group email would probably work best. Especially with the links to resources.  It doesn't put anyone on the spot. It gives people time to digest the information. Obviously there will be questions, and probably resistance. But that can all be handled individually, making for less stressful conversations.  This is tricky stuff, and you attitude does help.
Thanks for being so supportive of your daughter. It‚Äôs great to read. You probably did this, but just in case: make sure your daughter actually wants all those video calls and meet ups.   
Frankly, I would feel like an exotic zoo animal that‚Äòs being shown around, if my family did that.  

She said she doesn‚Äòt care for their opinions, so why have her confront every family branch in a zoom call, if there are likely to be many bad takes?   
If I had a child  I would prefer to tell family members alone with my partner (like the email idea), with permission what amount of info I can disclose.  
I would keep the prejudices & doubts away from my child as long as possible and only invite people if it arises naturally, not as a ritual that my child has to go through to claim acceptance.  

Edit: grammar
It pisses me off to no end that religious = excuse to be a pos bigot.
Thank you and great advice. To be clear, we are 100% ‚Äúin support of‚Äù and 0% ‚Äúin charge of‚Äù any way she wants to handle it. If she never wants to speak to them about it in person, that‚Äôs ok. I would hope that‚Äôs not the case but that‚Äôs not my decision to make.
Great insight. We would never push anything she is not comfortable with. As I said above, we are in support port of, not in charge of any of this. She wants to get it out there and we are just looking for ways to ease everyone into it. My thought is it would be easier to get everyone together in smaller groups who have shown support before just showing up at a wedding or a holiday when everyone knows her as a male. Frankly, we would not do that out of respect for her and everyone else. We are low drama (although right in the middle of it now lol) so even though we are 100% on our daughters side, we aren‚Äôt looking to throw bombs either.

Edit to add- any meet ups/ zoom calls would be with those who are supportive and want to build a relationship with their niece/granddaughter. If they don‚Äôt, they are out of the circle of trust.
Its not an excuse but it sure is used as one. Jesus would be pissed :)

In today‚Äôs installment of ‚Äòproof my dad doesn‚Äôt know s#!t about trans folk‚Äô‚Ä¶	An Adidas commercial came on talking about different reasons people say women can‚Äôt compete in sports, one of them obviously being trans women, and he went on a rant about how you ‚Äòonly ever see trans women competing because they have an advantage over biological women and trans men know they can‚Äôt possibly win against biological men.‚Äô Another case of argument without research.	"I really hate this argument because the truth of it is that you only ever see the trans athletes the far right media hand picks as an easy target. Crazy about how you never hear them talk about the trans women who don't win.
Also....there are transmen that won competition. And a lot tranwomen that loses some....(me at example)
I heard that females and males are actually biologically the same. I think males are usually stronger because they tend to do heavier work. But idk that‚Äôs just a theory‚Ä¶ a GAME theory (game of life lol)

What I've come to realize after almost two months on HRT.	"I used to be extremely worried about ""passing."" I now realize that bodies, and faces come in all different shapes and appearances. We all look like our true selfs despite what our dysphoria tells us. No matter what, we are letting our euphoria win. We are women, men, and anything enbytween. I feel feminine, so I am a woman. No matter what. Transitioning is the greatest form of self love we've ever extended toward ourselves. Especially for me, who I am inside never matched my outward expression. Now, nothing can change how feminine and empowered I feel. With or without makeup or a wig, I look in the mirror and see the her that used to scream at me to be let out. She's here, and no matter where you are in your journey, your true self will eventually be there as well. Much love to all of you during this holiday season. Keep up the hard work because each and every one of you are strong, beautiful people."	"Thank you, I‚Äôve been really struggling mentally recently and this was nice to read.
Awww
I started HRT about 1.5 months ago and feel exactly the same.

Much love to everyone over the holidays!
I'm also about 2 months in and starting to see glimpses of her in the mirror. It's a great feeling. 

My perspective on passing is that I'm not really worried if I pass, I want people to stop treating me like and referring to me as a man. I don't need to feel more fem, I just need cashiers to quit calling me sir.

Thank you for sharing this üòäüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüèÜüèÖü•π
Yea I‚Äôve always thought the idea of passing was kind of toxic. Like a path to more dysphoria
You're welcome. You deserve happiness and love
It's a great feeling
Exactly. It can get exhausting
I think my want to pass is related to me accepting myself as my non-birth gender. I don‚Äôt want to see myself as a boy in a dress, I want to see a woman in the mirror. I judge myself too hard, and I set unrealistic goals for myself.
When cashier's call me sir I just walk out of the store and leave everything on the counter if they call me sir before they've started ringing up I'll wait untill they'd their boss to cancel it for them and then walk away"	zth8d4	trans	43	0.98	2022-12-23 14:34:48

Even after transitioning I can‚Äôt escape being a sick fantasy to cis men	"Myself (26 FtM) has dealt with insane interactions with cis men my whole life. From them idealizing me, sexualizing me, trying to change me into a feminine female after telling them I identify as male and plan to transition etc. So I‚Äôve been transitioning for almost a year now and very visibly pass as male however my job knows I‚Äôm FtM as I started as female when I first got here. I don‚Äôt really talk all too much here to anyone other than casual conversation and I‚Äôm not particularly close with any of my coworkers. So one day a coworker approached me and said he would like to know me better and possibly become friends. I agreed as I don‚Äôt really have a lot of friends. This was at a point where I had lost most of my friends at the time to them
Being shitty and me cutting them off so I was in a vulnerable place atm. So we talk and he seems cool but then expresses how he finds me very attractive. Immediately I get a feeling that I know what this is gonna turn into but I brush it off. So as time goes on he starts getting more bold and asking things like if I‚Äôve been penetrated, my sex life etc. I have told him several several times I am not attracted to men and that I was with a man for nine years and I had never had sex with the man I dated for nine years hoping he would get the hint. He did not. There‚Äôs always either a subtle or not so subtle comment about him wanting to either date or have sex with me. He has expressed to me multiple times how he is sick of women and he‚Äôs dated are crazy etc and he wants to try dating men or more specifically trans men, such as myself. The interaction hasn‚Äôt been all bad and he has been cool other than him constantly trying to have sex or date me he‚Äôs not a bad guy but I‚Äôm not sure what to do after the most recent comment from him as after this I am unsure of his true intentions. I informed him I would be getting  surgery soon and he thought I meant bottom surgery I told him no I was getting top and he said that i should‚Äôve specificities because ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt get bottom surgery until I have experienced what it‚Äôs like to truly use the parts I have before I decide if I want to get rid of them‚Äù. I have stated multiple times to him I have no interest in penetration. Or in him in general and he does not get the hint.  I feel as if he‚Äôs keeping me around solely so he can ‚Äúwin me over‚Äù because he thinks I‚Äôm ideal to him for dating  and he is frustrated with dating women. I don‚Äôt want to have to cut him off as I said she‚Äôs not a bad guy but at the same time I‚Äôm unsure of his true intentions what should I do?"	"Sorry to hear that dude. For the record, he very much IS a bad guy, I'm not sure why you defend him, but if he clearly and continuously disrespects your boundaries and (clearly) just sees you as a sex trophy to conquer, and disrespects you as a whole the way you've described you can honestly let go of the polite ""he's not that bad"". It's very obvious he is bad just from what you wrote. A mountain lined with red flags if you ask me. Talk to HR and cut him off, be clear with him, don't give hints, tell him straight up.
This is something you need to talk to your boss about, it sucks that you don't have many freinds without him, but this behaviour is completely unacceptable, and if it jeopardises work for him maybe he'll stop.

If he gets past his first warnings, gets worse, and gets fired, and still carries on, that might be when you need to get the police involved. It's unlikely to go that way, but I've seen it happen üòï

Ive just started to experience the weird world of creepy men myself (mtf),

Stay strong Soldier! üí™
ewww he‚Äôs a creep dude wtf
seems nice bc he's trying to manipulate you over time  might get to a point he may get angry and goes a lil crazy you never know .  if you haven't already tell him he's making you uncomfortable and that it's just friends and anymore talk of it you'll have to go separate ways if it continues in anyway you can report it to hr saying you feel uncomfortable and explain everything and your attempts  to make it stop .
You need to drop him as you ""friend"". He is not a friend, he only wants you for sex.
Just reading this I‚Äôm getting a gross feeling about him. Aside from the fact that he **won‚Äôt shut up about penetrative sex,** he thinks you should ‚Äúgive it a try,‚Äù most likely *with him.* He clearly has absolutely **NO IDEA** what trans people go through, nor does he understand the pretty obvious boundaries you‚Äôve mentioned.  
  
Next time you see him, if he brings up *anything* even remotely related to sex, just flat out tell him:  
  
‚ÄúI just want to be friends, without benefits.‚Äù  
  
If he continues, and he keeps trying to convince you, that is sexual harassment in the form of attempted coercion and you might be able to get him fired if you bring it up to HR or a manager.
Omg men can just be the worst sometimes. This is sexual harassment please stand up for yourself and tell your boss or the police. Plus if you want a girl to talk to feel free to chat to me :)
I'm young so maybe don't listen to my advice, but isn't this something you could bring up with HR? If he's a coworker and making unwanted advances it's sexual harassment right?
Ooooooof, that‚Äôs big uncomfy. It sounds like you are setting boundaries and he‚Äôs not observing them frequently. It‚Äôs hard when your seeking connection but he seems kind of toxic and I‚Äôd be worried about manipulation with how much he‚Äôs been ‚Äúplanting seeds‚Äù. Your always well within your rights to tell him that if he doesn‚Äôt stop sexualizing you when you‚Äôve told him not to, you‚Äôll take action. This can be with your HR department or even legal action for sexual harassment. He shouldn‚Äôt be talking about your genitals when your not interested in doing so, way out of line. It really sucks when men use you as a way to fulfill their fantasies rather than just seeing you as you, but it‚Äôs his loss and I‚Äôd recommend putting energy into better relationships, foster those connections instead.

Edit: woman can also be way out of line (I‚Äôve been there myself) but it‚Äôs so many more men overall unfortunately. Had a guy just yesterday scream from his car if he could ‚Äúlick my butthole‚Äù while I was crossing the street. That was a new one to add to the grab bag ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
He said all of this outside of work pretty much
Thank you! I really appreciate it.
But he's still your co-worker, and you should feel comfortable at work

I hope this all gets better for you dude
It still counts as sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment."	xalhs3	trans	42	0.96	2022-09-10 09:58:40

I feel like the transphobes are winning	I keep looking at everything going on in my country and in the US and can't help thinking that transpbobia is beating me. How do people cope when they feel like there's no hope that the world will be welcoming to trans people? I could really do with some advice.	"Same thing happened in 2003 for the homosexual community, big ol' huzzah of, we'll make their marriages illegal, post reports of them having high suicide rates, constant negative news coverage... and now.... nothing from them... cause they lost. And they will again because being mean, malignant tumors on society is hard. And my word are people ever, on average, lazy. They will find something easier to do, and then home stretch. We don't aim to win, just outlast the stupid vile hateful morons.  
Edit: And then the next target of the stupid, probably machine learning algorithms if I had to guess, we get to support.
> How do people cope when they feel like there's no hope that the world   
will be welcoming to trans people? I could really do with some advice.

So, you have to look at the big picture, and this is easier if your an elder tran such as myself. For those of us who grew up in the 70s/80s/90s this isn't anything too different. Gay marriage, sodomy bans, they were all just ways to persecute the LGBT community. It will pass because on a whole, acceptance of gay people has only gotten better and better. Gen Z and the kids are overwhelmingly accepting of trans rights. 

There were no school walk outs for trans or gay rights when I was in highschool, no one cared, we were actively bullied (not that bullying can't still happen). But on a whole, the timeline swings towards us. Our duty now is to just hold on without giving up too much ground while the conservative boomers flail and whine about a world that is leaving them behind (and it is). We out number them, we out vote them, and the only way they can hold power is to meddle in elections, gerrymander, and try to overthrow democracy as a whole. They wouldn't do such if they weren't so desperate. It will come to a head with two outcomes, they either change and become more accepting, or they double down even more and slide into a full fascist wing of the body politic, in which they can't win an election. No moderate will vote for that. 

So it looks bad, but also try to remember that most of this has no real effect on your life, the internet is not real life, so go out and find your community, get your friends and enjoy your life. Vote where you can and protect yourself, but don't let it get to you. Move if you gotta (west coast best coast), but for sure it's not worth the anxiety.
I would suggest that transphobes gain disproportionate visibility and we shouldn't forget about the countless trans allies and supporters out there.
Thank you everyone, all the comments are giving me a lot of hope. They won't win, the world won't let them. We just have to speak our truth and people will see for themselves who's fighting for their right to live and who's fighting for the right to be a bully.
I've just been ignoring everything the best I can- I don't need gender affirming care or surgery or hormone treatment to be my valid boy self! The only thing that matters to me is that I'm a boy and no one can stop me from being one. I just have to pick and choose whom to tell I'm trans- which yeah- it hurts to constantly be misgendered and stay in the closet but- hey! I know deep down I'm a boy and nothing will change that.
It's easy to lose hope. I struggle with it sometimes. Especially because I've been transitioning since 2010. I've seen all this shit getting worse. I tried to sound the alarm when I saw it. It feels like no one has listened or cared. And if you oversaturate yourself with the bad news it's easy to feel like we're going to lose. But I don't think we will. Before this shit started, a lot of people got a chance to learn about us and love us... and I think there's enough people that love us and support us that we will prevail. We just have to rally together, stand strong, and fight back.
They are for now. But only  because of how balls to the wall obsessed and feverish they are over it. I honestly think I will be there downfall. They're just so crazy about it. 


 But it will eventually die down. Like all moral panics do. 

But right now we all have to fight like hell and convince cis people to help and save as many trans lives as possible.
It‚Äôs happening precisely because there has been a lot of progress. Unfortunately, there never seems to be any progress for any group of marginalized people without it quickly sparking a massive, terrifying, depressing backlash.
They are not winning, don't be depressed you have a community to support you. Their karma will be when their sons tell them they should have been born female.
I have met so many trans folk. I have met young ones, I have met old. I have met nieces ones, mean ones, funny ones, boring ones. I have met good trans folk, like good on a Bodhisattva level of kindness. I have met evil ones. I have met all sorts of trans folk, except one type. I have never met a weak one. We all have a strength. Others may not see it, at times it can be hard to see in yourself, but it‚Äôs there. I see it. Start there, take a deep breath, exhale, and recognize you are a walking talking badass. I know badasses. Trans folk are badasses. Don‚Äôt ever forget that. Ever. You‚Äôve got that grit, that sparkle. Whatever it is, you got it. If you are overwhelmed, and we all get there, take a time out from social media. I swear it helps. 

As for them winning. I don‚Äôt fucking think so. We didn‚Äôt roll hard at Compton‚Äôs Cafeteria, or at Stonewall, just to roll over because the bigots are on social media and infesting right wing politics. Fuck all that, and fuck them. We are QUEER. We aren‚Äôt going anywhere. I graduated high school in 1989. We nursed our gay brothers dying of AIDS when nobody would even touch them. I know, I was one of the volunteers. I had to fight for HRT, fight for GCS, stand up in a courtroom and be declared a woman , while people laughed at me, and you think we are giving up? Yeah, um no. We aren‚Äôt going anywhere. I have taken beatings for my tribe, we aren‚Äôt giving up. Take a hot shower my love, take a break, but we aren‚Äôt going anywhere and we need your sparkle too.
I tend to ignore social media and just deal with real people. That way you see how few rabid transphobes there really are.
They're not. They won't ever. Even the loudest eventually go quiet. We just have to remain loud ourselves
I don't know how the situation is in your country, but generally I would disagree with you. The people who are antagonistic against us are loud minority. And things have gotten so much better already in the last 10 years. I grew up in the 90s... And if I compare my then situation to young trans people now... Society has become so much more accepting.  
What we're seeing is a pushback, but in the end this pushback will probably die down just like the pushback against homosexual rights.  
Until then we need to survive! :)

It's of course still dangerous times, but I don't think globally we will go back to how things were before.
There is a lot of trans phobe winning going on across the middle states. It's creeping me out but I can't let myself be disheartened. I know there are at least some small ways I can help. To start, I have to maintain personal hope and stay positive with humility and without looking away or taking my own success or privilege for the great sacrifices of shoulders I'm standing on.
Here in the USA, they are..
This. It's a cycle.

In the US, half of these bills are not meant to stand, most of them are blatantly unconstitutional. They're trying to scare us and do as much damage as they can before reality sets in.

Reality:
1. The vast majority of Americans oppose these bills and only a handful have or will pass at all.
2. Every generation has been more lgbtq-open than in the past.
3. Every generation has been significantly less religious than the last.
4. Gen Z and Millenials are overwhelmingly in favor of some socialist economic reforms.
5. Republicans, fresh off of this and abortion, have been really, really pissing off the moderates.

That means that Republicans are a dying breed. They dangerous as all hell, but only in the short term. Things have the potential to get really bad for a while. We just have to survive. And I don't know about you, but by this point, I'm a cockroach on PCP.
As an older trans person, I totally agree. The conversation I often have with people is the comparative between what homosexual people faced in the 80s/90s. It‚Äôs the exact same things being said today as was said then, and for the exact reasons. The socially conservative say outrageous things about us to make trans people look like villains in order to enrage conservative voters in hopes the conservatives show up to vote. Calling us pedophiles, mentally ill, confused, brainwashed‚Ä¶ and their agenda is to protect the children and woman from those dangerous trans gender people‚Ä¶. I remember all of those being said 30 years ago about the homosexual community. This too shall pass. I look at my duty, not as an elder, but certainly an older trans person, to endure so those who follow don‚Äôt have to. Frame it as you helping those around you‚Ä¶ it makes enduring a little less suck knowing you‚Äôre helping someone else.
I needed this. Thank you.

Lots of good things happened yesterday.	"I‚Äôm 14, tranfem non binary, and after school yesterday, my friend and I walked to Walmart, and got me some nail polish for the first time.

Exactly! If we root ourselves in a scientific understanding of the world, we can replace the current system, which has long outlived its progressive role, with a new one that can redefine the structure of society that allows an end to the gender binary. An equal basis for all people. 

The action is only half the battle, it‚Äôs gonna require study.
From personal experience, building the labor movement is a pretty decent start.

And building political power off of the labor movement and any pro-LGBT organizations would be the next part.

We gotta get out of this mindset of just voting and electoral politics, we need to permanently suppress our oppressors, and that means taking these mechanisms of power and leveraging them to build a revolutionary movement.
I wouldn‚Äôt say getting rid of the gender binary is exactly the way to go, I‚Äôd say more getting rid of oppressive gender norms and gendered expectations and creating a system that‚Äôs more open to things outside of the gender binary while not full on getting rid of it would be better imo
I see where you‚Äôre coming from! The point I‚Äôm making is that there isn‚Äôt a gender binary at all, and a system that allows for genders that aren‚Äôt man and woman would have to acknowledge that, they‚Äôre the majority but not the default, ya know?

A system that accepts genders outside of the currently accepted binary is a system that rejects that binary by its function.
Ohhhh yeah I think I see what you mean, because if we had that kind of system in the first place I‚Äôm doubtful we‚Äôd have a gender binary at all, there‚Äôd just be people of any number of genders. Yeah I definitely agree, I think I misunderstood you the first time lol, sorry
No you‚Äôre good! I could talk about this all day. Lol

Trump‚Äôs video on transgender care has made me realize something	"Before anything I‚Äôm not sure if this is counted as possible trigger or vent so:

I‚Äôm ftm and a teenager and I‚Äôve been out to my friends as trans for a year. This whole time I‚Äôve been dreaming of the day I could start testosterone. Now bc of Trump‚Äôs video I‚Äôm realizing that by the time I‚Äôm of age it‚Äôll be a year too late for me. There‚Äôs constantly attacks against transness but I never really thought that my right to be who I am would ever actually be fully taken away from me. Any republican candidate that wins in 2024 will probably immediately come for our healthcare and I just dont know if I can handle it. Do these people want to see us dead if they can‚Äôt see us conform?


Edit: I do not want to seem like I‚Äôm spreading false information or fear mongering. I‚Äôm not saying any of these things will happen I just need a place to convey my fear as a young trans person. I love y‚Äôall stay safe ‚ù§Ô∏è"	"""Now bc of Trump‚Äôs video I‚Äôm realizing that by the time I‚Äôm of age it‚Äôll be a year too late for me""

So much wrong here.

A, Trump has little chance of becoming president. 

B, Any republican president has to pass his healthcare laws through congress which is sharply divided and currently controlled in the senate by democrats. 

C, Even if they pass the senate, there is no realistic way for them to ban HRT since it is already prescribed and given freely to CIS people. The only change is who you get your medication from. Think how marijuana is currently in a weird grey market. HRT will be the same. 

D, It's never too late for anyone to transition. A year or two doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.

But yes, they do want us dead, but there is very little the can actually do about it.
100%, that's been the republican mission statement since 2021 to see us dead. The best thing we can do is be advocates for ourselves. Protest, convince everyone you know what's on the fence to vote, and to vote Democrat. 
You dont want those same people to get snatched up by Tucker Carlson or Matt Walsh, because the next thing you know, they're going to be the ones with guns while we're all lined up at the death camps. Good luck, soldier.
I really wish the young people doom posting saw what it was like in the 2000s. 

I was alive for that time, and the things we're afraid of happening now were status quo then. Access to HRT and trans affirming healthcare were extremely extremely difficult to get then. Just bc there was no ""ban"" doesnt mean it wasnt banned. 

Things got better. Trans medical care is more advanced and accessible. There are doctors on our side. My therapist is part of a group of therapists and doctors thru Included Health that focus on trans healthcare specifically bc Doctors and therapists know trans health care is hard to access and they are making a stand. Theyve been doing this for a couple of years now. 

yes its scary that theyre coming for us with their propaganda machine, but it would take a lot for them to make things worse than it already was when I was growing up 

Its going to be okay. Cis people do care about us. There are allies in the medical community fighting for us as well ‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT dont let the loud transphobes convince you that we dont have allies devoting their professional lives to our liberation. 

EDIT 2 You are not alone in this fight. Stay strong, dear one. All the love from Texas
You will start be able to start testosterone one day, I promise us older peepo will do everything we can to prevent anyone from taking away our, and your, future.
Here‚Äôs my hope for the 2024 election - the GOP is primed for ruination.  Trump will not go quietly into the goodnight.  DeSantis is too smart to be played by the orange freakazoid.  Both want the throne.  Neither will get it while the other remains.  Our best hope is that their inability to set aside pride will cause a rift in the base, one that will sink the GOP for good.
The decision on the Arkansas case that banned care should be coming soon.  Hoping it is found unconstitutional, which will help everyone!
If a national ban is passed, I think a lot of us (myself included) will be done asking for rights. Done asking, not done working towards them.
Don‚Äôt worry. Won‚Äôt stop him from using EOs. 

He has a good shot at winning. Don‚Äôt discount that. Until the election is in the books and a spineless dem is in office at least. If it‚Äôs not trump then desantis is equally if not more dangerous. 

Really our best hope is that they rip each other apart enough that they lose the EC. They won‚Äôt win the popular, but we know that doesn‚Äôt mean anything anyway.
Totally agree, we have to stick around to spite them. Being trans isn‚Äôt a choice, so we also have to hang on to try and build a better foundation for the future. We have to make a stand so they don‚Äôt keep killing us, they can‚Äôt deny the reality of advanced biology forever, the longer they try the more people they‚Äôll hurt.
When talking doesn't work (or work enough), action must be taken to protect what is right regardless of any public opinion.

I, for one, will not sit idle if there is any progress made in banning HRT or other medical care for trans people. I personally know what it's like to grow up in and live in a household that is transphobe and homophobe. I personally know the pain, and nobody deserves such.

I can't believe how much anti-trans laws have actually become real. Like, whatever happened to ""land of the free""?

We have to stick together and do what we can to do what is right, even if that is illegal.
I grew up during those times. People routinely got the crap beat out of them for even hinting they were gay or trans. Good luck having anyone come to your rescue, even teachers. It was a mess and I sometimes wonder how I managed to survive it.

Today it is so much better than it was and that makes me happy. What pisses me off is that the haters are still getting their way in a lot of areas and they need to be set straight.
Thank you for this encouragement :) I‚Äôm in Louisiana and it makes it so hard to remember there are people on my side when all I see is casual and even aggressive transphobia every day. I wanted to make sure that people knew that my post isnt me spreading any news its just my fear as a trans person. But even if no cis people were here for us I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd fight for ourselves. I love all my trans brothers and sisters <3
EOs don‚Äôt have the power to ban or legalize anything period. If they have both houses and the presidency, that‚Äôs a huge issue. Otherwise it‚Äôs not happening. And states that have passed trans safe laws will continue to be safe in a grey market most likely.
The EOs aren't laws though, he can direct his federal agencies but that doesn't change the law.
Yep!!! 

Like not just actual gay and trans people getting hate crimed, but anyone who LOOKED even slightly like they might be. I remember when the emo trend was in full swing and people were fucking PISSED about how GNC the style was and posting videos beating emo guys and calling them gay slurs 

Through out my childhood and pre teens the only representation of trans or gay people I saw were stories of them getting murdered. I was genuinely terrified of getting murdered for like, most of my life lol. Then one day I realized they could come for me anyway, for any reason, and I realized Id want to die as myself and go down swinging. Thats what lead to me coming out. So me even coming out was me getting fed up with living in fear and deciding this was life or death, and that I would fight to the end. 

Im glad we made it, friend ‚ù§Ô∏è I also think its a miracle.
I completely understand, my friend. I hope I didnt sound critical of you or anybody ""doom posting"", bc its completely understandable and important to reach out for support so youre doing the right thing, and Im just sorry all the transphobia is bringing you down.

It's natural to get lost in all the transphobic noise. I think about when I was younger than 18 and how scared I was of the world. And then when I entered adulthood and got my first job, of course I experienced transphobia along the way, but I also found so much support it really blew my mind. I feel like the world, even a rural TX town, completely opened itself up to me. I began to see other trans and LGB people in the world, I met 3 trans coworkers, had LGB managers, and realized how brainwashed I was and how badly the transphobes want to take away our hope so we give up before we can experience the real world and see how loving it can be towards us, and how many of us are out there. I have even found with Republicans, they can weirdly enough be strong allies IRL even if they vote for transphobic politicians. Its definitely weird, but showed me a lot of these people are brain washed too, to think trans people are a certain way and then they meet us and cannot help but feel normal human attachments and compassion. A Republican man in his 50s thanked my mom for supporting me, and was very emotional about it. It was definitely strange, bc Im sure he will still go on to vote for people who will Not support me. But it shows people dont inherently hate us, and there is hope that just by existing and living our best lives we are helping those around us see the real world for what it really is too. 

Sorry for rambling, I am just old and desperately want you to know it will be ok ‚ù§Ô∏è
And that‚Äôs stopped him, when?
Literally multiple times he wanted to do something and didn‚Äôt have congress backing him.
Can you be more specific? If you look at what he accomplished policy wise, it was actually very little (mostly enriching himself/his buddies)."	10tox56	trans	33	0.92	2023-02-04 19:28:39

I am a 16 year old lesbian, and I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm too pretty to be gay and I‚Äôd be wasting my looks dating other women, but I want to be a man so badly. But I don‚Äôt feel as if I was born in the wrong body. I am cis-gendered and I am comfortable and in love with the fact that I am a woman. But sometimes I just think of myself becoming this ideal man later in life and being a total dream. I would give up anything to look like an irl Risotto from jjba or Peter Steele. Sometimes I want to ask my parents if I can transition and get a head start on being a man. I only want to look a certain way though. But I love being a girl at the same time? This is normal right? I am so sorry if this was in any way shape or form offensive.	"Figuring out your gender identity can be tricky. It's also possible that you could be non binary or genderfluid. But just be true to who you are and you will figure it out. It took me til just this year at 25 to figure out I was trans.  So. Keep your head up. You got this
The ""wrong body"" narrative is mostly used for ease of explanation with cis people. Lots of trans people don't find it a good description of their experience. You might want to read [this](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/), it helped many people figure themselves out.

My whole life I‚Äôve been receiving compliments about how gorgeous of a girl I am \[...\] but I want to be a man so badly."" I mean...
You can do this... I think that the idea of beign born in the wrong body is not literal for everyone; I for one don't feel like it, but still get some dysphoria and such; I just think my body doesnt work as I want it to all the time.

it took me like 5+ years to start my transition, I'm 37 now and have been transitioning for the past 2... Anyone can redefine themselvs at any moment, you can find yourself later in life, or earlier, just hear to what you doubt and what you feel...  


Doubting if you are/arent is something that defines a lot of the trans earlier identity, cis peeps dont wonder. I think you might be gender fluid or agender or another form of non-binary, maybe! I'm just judging by what you wrote.

Be safe out there!
Gender dysphoria hits everyone a little differently. So it‚Äôs hard to say if you are trans or not without a deeper understanding. 

I also never felt like I was born in the wrong body. I just always wanted to be in a different body. My only point here is there isn‚Äôt much difference between the two statements. So I wouldn‚Äôt put much stock in it. 

I would recommend finding a therapist that specializes in gender identity disorder. I realize that is for a variety of reasons, harder to do while you‚Äôre a minor. But what you can at least do is keep your eyes and ears open for it, and maybe figure out how to see them.
>look like an irl Risotto from jjba

Nice. You can always do cosplay too.



But to stay on topic feel the way you feel, I think being trans is fluid so even if you choose to stay as a cis female you can still feel male. It drives me crazy when guys say ""you're to pretty to be gay"" who asked you?
Nobody can figure out your gender identity but you. I guess one place to look would be to ask, when you get comments about being a good-looking girl, how does it make you feel? It's typical of binary trans people to feel uncomfortable when they're complimented in the characteristic terms of their birth gender (so handsome, so pretty, etc).

Sometimes when we say things to others, we bury strong, clear statements within more ambiguous ones, but in what you wrote, this stands out: 'I want to be a man so badly.' It's not the whole story, no doubt, but it's worth re-seeing your own words maybe.

Also, 'wasting your looks dating women' is... not a great thing to say to someone?
I'd say something like ""my girlfriend appreciates my good looks, they're not wasted."" Then block them.

So the cool thing is, you can transition at any age. You don't have to like, immediately start HRT right now. If you see yourself as a man ""later in life"", then do that. I started at 45 and it's fine! You can do it whenever feels right for you, and you're the only one who can decide when that is. If you want to be a young girl now, enjoy that! There's plenty of time to be an old man later. If your parents wouldn't be supportive then you're actually setting yourself up well right now for a transition later by wanting to wait until you're older, when you'll have full control of your body, your insurance, your money, your housing, etc. I mean if you want to start now, and your parents are cool, that's fine too. Your call - or it should be.

When I started transitioning, I wanted to look like Brooke Shields. But I know that - aside from sharing a hair type - it's probably not realistic that I'm going to look like a famous super model. I think the thing to realize about wanting to look like someone like that is, you're going to look like YOU when you're done. I'm starting to look more like the ""real me"" than ever before. But I can look like me with a bit of her style. I can absolutely copy her hair and makeup, and put on a big pair of Fossil sunglasses like a Hollywood starlet but I have to accept my cheekbones, and Brooke never weighed over 250lbs a day in her life either so it's not going to be a 1:1 match at all. Make the changes you can make, accept the things you cannot change, and be kind to yourself through it all.
>but I want to be a man so badly

That's literally all it takes to be trans. I like my pre transition body but, no matter how hard or often a mirror causes me to doubt transitioning, I always come back to how much more happy I'll be. Just like I have, you just need to decide what path you want to take and take it
If you are comfortable within your body and sense of self as a woman and actually *love* being a woman then I would not recommend medical transition. By all means *do* play with and explore your identity, presentation and expression. Women don't have to look or act a certain way and you've obviously already seen some of the pressures of society with regards to who they think you should be based on your appearance. 

Medical transition would also not make you into this ideal man that you have in mind. You cannot transition into Peter Steele. You would still be you; complete with all your character flaws and insecurities, just with a deeper voice, more hair in some places, likely less in other places and changes to your genitals. It would of course also change the way you navigate life, how you are perceived and treated by others, the expectations and rules put on your gender, your social role and more.
You may consider cross-posting to egg\_irl, they may have some additional helpful perspectives. Be sure to make it clear to them from the start that you're still cis tho so they don't get any ideas!
Gender can be hard to figure out... Perhaps one of the best tests that I know is... If you you had a button that could swap your sex and makes it so everyone in your life has always seen you as that sex and gender and you could only press it once. Would you push it? If no to the permanent change. Would you push it if you could freely change back and forth whenever you want? It's not a perfect test but if you say yes to either there's a really good chance you're trans... And even now while you're questioning I'd say that's enough to say you're not cis.  Now could you find that you are cis? Sure. But while you're questioning your gender you definitely fall outside of the category of cis. In my personal experience I don't know any cis people who have even questioned their gender. Idk many trans people in person other than myself but yeah if you're questioning you're most likely not cis
You might be genderqueer or non-binary! It's okay to like being a girl but also want to be a man sometimes. You could also be genderfluid. Explore your identity and get to know your full self.
I‚Äôd say if you are unsure, take blockers until you know what you want for sure.  Then again, I could only imagine me as a woman but had to, conform and be who I was expected to be as when I was growing up there was literally no acceptance for trans people.  Take your time and figure yourself out.  Only you can know who you are.
Well, think about your gender identity and your gender expression, for example, a cousin of mine is a woman, it's super comfortable being a woman, and loves her name and female pronouns, but she is her own version of a woman. She loves looking ""like a man"", she's expressing her femininity in that way, and its valid too.

If you want to define your womanhood by looking like Risotto from JJBA, then go ahead, you're not less of a woman if you want to express yourself that way.

If what you're struggling with is a fluctuating gender identity or something outside the binary genders, you may be genderfluid, agender, demi-girl, or one of the rest of the genders.

Whatever the case is, I would recommend you to do an introspection, think about what it means to you, who are you?, And how do you want to express who you are? Its all very personal.
And remember, in the case that you're trans, YOU define your gender, not because you're a trans-men means you'll never be able to do things that are stereotypically for women, or that you have to behave in a certain way. You define your identity üíú

SCOTUS is receiving a lot of heat that properly should be directed at Congress for by stepping it's responsibilities and passing difficult issues off to the courts.

If Congress had enacted properly crafted legislation when it should have, none of these issues would be in contention.

Imo, SCOTUS is merely giving the finger to Congress, effectively forcing it to assume the responsibilities entrusted to it."	vrpa9g	trans	34	0.97	2022-07-05 04:12:25

need to ask.	"I'm on pc, i normally use my phone but its broken, so, I'm sorry for spelling errors.

I'm dating this bi girl (she's cis) and I'm mtf. she uses he/him pronouns when she talks about me. i told her how much it hurts, but she still uses those pronouns. A week ago i asked if she will call me a girl when I  transition, she said she will. so, would you guys say she's transphobic?

Edit: it's an online relationship, she lives in germany, and I live in the U.S.

edit 2: some of you might see this as a win... but my partner and I are not an item anymore... i have abandonment issues and everytime when she looked at my message and when she didn't text back i use to be really sad and my anxiety made me think she was gonna break up with me so i told her about it... but it did not help so i said we should take a break until she comes to America. then she got mad/upset/hurt and told me to delete pics of her i didn't have. i told her that the relationship is just put on hold, then she said she didn't care about the relationship she just want the pics delete i told her that i don't have the pics then she told me not to text her again. i told her please don't let it end like this, and that i still love her. but she said i only used her to fill a hole in my heart and that i just wanted her to send me nudes of her. (i did ask her from time to time, but i wasn't using her, and if anything she showed me what it's like to love again). she then blocked me, i went to visit my mother then i checked to see if she still has me blocked, and she doesn't. i hope you enjoyed my update."	"She‚Äôs being mean, I‚Äôd keep an eye out for any other rude behavior
I feel like if she loved you shed at least try to not hurt you yk?
Are you out to other people besides her? Maybe she just doesn‚Äôt want to out you to people who don‚Äôt know
You don‚Äôt need to put up with that shit!
Yeah, if she keeps misgendering you when you correct her and she doesn't even try to use your correct pronouns, she's being very ignorant, and kinda transphobic. Also why would she wait to call you a girl till you transition. You are a girl and she can call you a girl now, because you already are a girl.
Save yourself the pain and leave girl. I just read that it‚Äôs an online relationship and it takes zero effort too type she instead of him tf üôÑ
Not phobic but I'd say she speaks on what she sees so its hard to see you otherwise. Because you've chosen this identity for yourself, the switch isn't made for others that easily or quickly. Many don't acknowledge the change until a change is seen BUT if you keep asking her to respect your pronouns and she doesn't then that's a problem.
Guatemala
not acceptable at all. regardless of whether you look like a girl right now (as you talked about in other comments) she, as your partner, should be making the effort regardless. it's simply not good enough that she won't call you by your pronouns.
she can get rude at times. but only at times.
I'm pretty sure she loves me. I just don't understand why she is using male pronouns with me. She even called me a man the other day.
it's an online relationship and I'm out to everyone online. I had to go back in the closest because I'm scared that my brother will start a fight with her when she uses male pronouns when she moves to the U.S.
do you have any tips to make her stop calling me he/him?
I don't know, maybe she doesn't see me as a girl until i transition?
if i do leave her it won't be easy for me.
I talked to her about it a few times, but it doesn't seem like she'll call me she/her until i transition or maybe she'll never call me she/her. i really don't know yet.
>Guatemala

what?
sadly she isn't my partner anymore.
That sounds like she isn‚Äôt a nice person if this is a pattern of behavior. You don‚Äôt need to be in a relationship if it doesn‚Äôt make you happy. Not being in a relationship is better than a bad one
It's a simple answer, she sees you as a man right now. Not saying it cannot change. But if you talk about it with her and she still refuses to change then- üòê
Then, I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs transphobic, which I‚Äôm sorry to say, and I know you probably don‚Äôt like to hear. Luckily, it seems like she‚Äôs open to change.
I think I would tell her you are transitioning, and part of that is that non-bigots who you keep in your life use your chosen pronouns. Transition looks different for everyone, you have started transition and are hiding aspects but you are a woman and deserve to be talked to like one. 

Not everybody does all the ‚Äòsteps‚Äô of transition, even if you haven‚Äôt begun any physical work on it you are transitioning just by knowing you‚Äôre a woman and sharing with people you trust
Honestly if you‚Äôve told her it hurts and you don‚Äôt want her to do it and she STILL does it, That‚Äôs a deal breaker for me. I want to be fully seen and respected in a relationship and pronouns are the most basic way to do that. So if someone can‚Äôt respect that then I don‚Äôt wanna even talk to them let alone be in a relationship with them.
Transition starts the moment you identify as a woman. End of. If they don't respect your identity, they don't respect you.
Well if she doesn't see you as a woman now, she's completely blind and you should dump her.
Aww, I know. But she literally does not care enough about you for something as simple as pronouns even when you‚Äôve told her how much it hurt you. It‚Äôs your decision at the end of the day but you don‚Äôt deserve someone like that. You know what‚Äôs best for you at the end of the day just know you deserve everything in life.
Guatemala
i wouldn't call it bad. she does make me happy when she isn't calling me he/him or a man
her and i broke up.
Her and I have been dating for almost a year, i really don't want to break up with her.
I'm gonna do every step of transitioning. but i don't think she'll call me a girl until i look like one.
well, she does help me with my depression when she's not calling me he/him. Plus i do love her when she's not calling me he/him
i mean, she does make me happy other than calling me he/him and a man
like the country?
You deserve someone who will respect you, which she clearly isn't doing
Sometimes change doesn't need to be immediate. Communicate clearly how much it's important for you that she uses the right pronouns. Correct her when she does a mistake. That's personally how I got all my older friends to call me correctly
Well, you‚Äôre a woman so you look like a woman. Some women don‚Äôt look like how people expects a woman to look like. 

Even if you plan to one day appear as more of what people expect a woman to look like; you are still a woman today. She needs to know this
You do what feels right for you. I‚Äôm just saying that with the info you gave it‚Äôs a major red flag and sounds like you‚Äôre making excuses for her. Either way I hope you work something out xx
Well, Its your choice ofc. I hope she stops misgendering you.

i did try a couple of times, but it didn't work. But I'll try again.
maybe i am. if her and i don't work out i'll be done with love. maybe that's why i am making excuses for her? and thank you
her and i broke up, so, it'll be hard to do that.
Don't give up. It can be a long process but it will be worth it
thank you for your help
well i can't correct her anymore, we broke up and she told me not to talk to her then blocked me, then she unblocked me but i don't think she'll text me again

No Lessons Learned	" It really bothered me this morning that mere days after the Brianna Ghey's senseless murder and the subsequent backlash over the media‚Äôs role in stirring anti trans feeling, this is the Telegraph‚Äôs headline this morning : STURGEON BROUGHT DOWN BY TRANS ROW.

The First Minister made her reasons for stepping down very clear in her speech but they insist it was her trans support according to ‚Äúa party source‚Äù in an article which also minimises Sunak's tribute to her while spending more column inches on Trump's gibbering condemnation.

Headlines like this remind me of They Live, the John Carpenter movie with subliminal messages fed to the populace.

For the first time in over a year I didn‚Äôt shower by candlelight!	"For over a year I‚Äôve only showered at night when I‚Äôm dead tired right before bed. Before my egg cracked I‚Äôd convinced myself it was to fall asleep easier afterwards-I recently connected the dots that dysphoria‚Äôs been keeping me up super late these past few weeks (and likely going back much further). 

The soft candlelight smooths the contours of my body while illuminating less of it, both with and without using a mirror. If you want to try it out please be safe. Keep the candle away from any flammable surface and where you cannot accidentally kick it over. I use a three-wick scented jar candle on my bathroom vanity.

Anyhow my dysphoria let up enough the other night that I had the fortitude to uncomfortably shower with the lights on! Sure, I had to go back to candlelight the next day, but it still feels like an important step forward-and I could really use the win right now."

His main argument was that some guy apparently ""got tired of not winning any prizes and came out as trans, started doing drag for a month, and when he got into womens sports, he won the first prize."" (Kinda unbelievable to me that, even though all those anti-trans laws exist something like that was possible)

When i tried to argue that I personally think that people should, instead of AFAB and AMAB, be separated by hormone levels or weight, like in boxing, he said that in america people would call me transphobic for saying that.

I am a (closeted) trans guy, I am not too familiar with sports rules for trans people in America (I'm from Serbia). I am sorry if i offend anyone, it wasn't my intention and i will edit the post if i said something problematic.

I need a genuine opinion from other trans people, do you think separating sportists in categories like this is transphobic?"	"no, hormone levels is the more inclusive option. we already have weight classes for things like MMA and boxing, so having classes for certain hormone/performance levels is not transphobic. if you were to label them as ""men's"" and ""women's"", then it would be phobic because not every woman has a certain level of estrogen or testosterone, and the same goes with men. we should care about how well the athlete can perform against similar competitors, not what their chromosomes are
Your teacher is the transphobe. Being trans isn't drag. 

I would report him.
The real problem is that only the ones that are breaking records and getting the headlines are making it difficult for the rest of us. There are enough trans women in sports that are just being competitive, because it's legit not easy to win.

Until my recent move, minor depression, and weight gain, I had been racing bicycles for years and even competed on the national level. I've competed in smaller professional level events, and I've ended up on the podium at those events. But there are no news stories about me (very happy about that).

From someone who has (and will again) compete with women, I'm mixed about these blown-up stories. There's a natural range of performance within the field of women athletes. Most trans women fall within that natural range and there are no issues. The IOC (International Olympic Committee) and the USOC have done studies on trans women in sports, and the conclusion is that after a certain amount of time on HRT and especially after surgery to remove the T factories, trans women fall within the natural range of women. However, it takes about 2 years for those natural levels (strength, endurance, etc) to drop, and one of my trans professional cycling friends had to stay out of competition during that period. When she came back, she's a strong woman racer, but she's not even the strongest in the regional races that I competed in where I used to live.

I HAVE NOT LOOKED INTO THIS, SO THIS IS PURELY SPECULATION

My concern is that these controversial athletes took a shortcut to get back into competition faster than the USOC recommends, which gives all trans athletes a bad name. I didn't go to nationals in one cycling discipline that I could probably win or even set a record (my coach and friends encouraged me to go to the event), because there were some recent trans athlete scandals, and I didn't want to put myself under a possible microscope. My stealth life is immensely more important than a medal. I'm not judging them for their choice, just adding color that their choice impacts other trans athletes.
Sports is the Wedding Cake of anti-trans stuff as far as talking points. Makes sense on the surface and gets people on that side, but hides much worse issues. That's where I usually start the discussion. 

However, I do think there should be a divide due to intrinsic advantages. It is not transphobic to acknowledge basic biology. 

So yes, there should be a divide. But using it as an excuse to shit on trans people is the cheap way into taking about anti-trans things beyond ""can swim faster.""
Separating athletes into comparable groups is certainly not transphobic. 
Sometimes trans folks fall into a grey area, but mostly they are pretty easily sortable. 
A not on hormones well trained transwoman shouldn't compete in the womens division and vice versa for men. Both should be on hormones a while before being allowed to compete, so hormones are in general male/female range. 

Weight is already a factor many sports divide by. 

That story your teacher had is bullshit, 100% didn't happen. Or he would have been able to name a name. That would have made headlines. 
The majority of trans athletes get bested by their cis counterparts all the time.
It's not transphobic, it's actually a great point. Your teacher is an idiot.
Seperating based on hormone levels and weight is exactly what I think we should do (as a trans man)

I think its more transphobic to go by biological sex, and ignore someones identity
Honestly I don't think sports like golf, luge, figure skating, skiing/snowboarding/surfing, bowling, tennis/ping pong, and other sports that are primarily skill based have any right being separated by gender. Having a cock and balls doesn't make you better at golf or tennis than someone who doesn't, and a lot of the arguments for separating these sports are just misogynistic and false. 

For other sports, as a trans person, I really don't give a single shit. Separate them or don't. But the literal truth is that if you're a trans person and you're on hormone therapy, you're evenly matched. There's not enough of a hormonal difference for it to matter.
Nope a complete idiot he is
hormone levels can vary wildly from person to person. the reason PEDs work is because they increase your hormone levels beyond your baseline. your total hormone level might still be wildly lower than that of another person while on PEDs.

Its nothing more than a rally cry, a recruitment device. 

It reflects under the 1% of trans ppl (don't have figures but your not all sports stars). It comes from a decisive place, somewhere sinister, repeated by the confused üòï
There's only an ""intrinsict advantage"" to those trans people who don't undertake any kind of medical transition. A couple months on T blockers and E and whatever ""biological advantage"" a trans woman possesses is gone. And in fact evidence shows that trans women have a harder time than cis women putting on more muscle after that. So if anything, trans women are at a disadvantage. You only hear people complain about it when against all odds a trans woman manages to win at something.

The arguments generally also completely ignore trans men.
All the more reason to make the divider different than gender.

Let people PED themselves into the next performance class.

At the very least dividing sports by gender is unfair regardless of cis or trans issues, you still have big physical gaps between competitors, for example in the NBA you can end up with a 5'3"" player next to 7'9""

I also find it funny that every time an issue like this is discussed someone has to bring up CIS guys faking being trans to gain access to women's spaces.
I'm not sure what the best solution is. In combat sports there are weight limits, which generally seem pretty fair. In team sports you often end up with just those best suited for the sport (a whole team of tall people in basketball for example).   


But i don't think there is any useful way to make hormones a limiting factor. Especially for people on hormone therapy because you cant really figure out their ideal 'baseline' very easily. and like i said its variation from baseline which matters most.  


a man with very low T might see huge results from being bumped up to an 'average' level. but someone with naturally very high T would still not be seeing those results because their baseline would be different, they'd need a boost up from their baseline to see similar results.
Agreed, I think mixed-gender sports with Performance Metric based classes would be a good direction, but honestly don't know enough about sports to suggest what those would be.

Hormones are weird, different people have different results from the same levels, I don't think they should be used as a limiting factor."	t0ro8j	trans	28	0.85	2022-02-25 01:52:18
I just need to scream into the void for a second.	Hope you don't mind. It's been a really rough last few days. I'm on the verge of tears almost constantly. I feel ugly and depressed. I know this will pass. I know it will get better. I came out 9 months ago and this is my first major depression since. I call that a win, but God damn. I'm sitting here because I can't face my wife. She loves me dearly and has my back. She is one of my favorite people and I love her madly. But I just... can't. I have too many ing around. I'm only posting here because I'm fairly sure no one I know irl knows who I am on reddit. I want to hold my kids. My youngest won't talk to me. He hasn't spoken to me since before I came out. My oldest is also trans and non binary. I love them both to pieces. My wife has been wonderful through all of this, but I can't just keep piling more on her. I feel like a burden. My therapist bumped me up to once a well today. I'll meet with her again next Monday. I just feel raw. Venting has helped, believe it or not. This little post has taken half an hour to write. I'm a bit calmer now. If you read this far, thank you. üíú I'll be okay. I can do this. Back straight, chin up. Maybe tomorrow will be better.

Do you think things will get worse before they get better? Or is the worst mostly behind us?	"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look back. The past is a nightmare of horrors.‚Äù I forget where that quote is from. (Some movie, probably.) But it makes me think of how bad things have been for trans people, and how it seems like only recently that we‚Äôve made any progress toward tolerance. Good for us. But then I realize that every day there‚Äôs a new story in the news about anti-trans laws or a growing ‚Äúpushback‚Äù from people who hate us. Not to mention all the transphobia you read about or experience firsthand. 

So how does it end? In a couple years, the Right is going to do their damndest to put another bigot in the White House, maybe Trump or that guy from Florida or someone like them, and it sounds like they might win. If not, I feel like a big civil war or something big and brutal is simmering. Lots of angry right-leaning gun owners out there‚Ä¶

What do you think? Are we winning? Are we doomed? Maybe I just need a hug."	"I think it‚Äôs easy to slip into binary thinking on this sort of thing. It‚Äôs never as easy as we‚Äôre either doomed or we‚Äôre not. 

The future belongs to us but only if we fight for it. I won‚Äôt lie and say it‚Äôs easy but if you‚Äôre worried look into how you can push for change. Call your representatives if your state is pushing anti-trans bills and tell them your opinion. It‚Äôs their job to represent you as a constituent. 


If you‚Äôre scared about the 2024 election the I highly suggest voting in November midterms this year if you can as keeping the house and senate are important and midterm elections tend to be overlooked compared to years with presidential elections. 

Maybe try to  take a break from the news and the doomsrolling for the sake of your mental health. 


And also I‚Äôm here to provide hugs if you need one.
Assume the worst and prepare for it.  Then you'll always be pleasantly surprised when it turns out to be not that bad.
Arm yourselves and be active in your communities. Get involved in mutual aid groups. These are a couple ways we can make ourselves ready today.

It's going to get worse before it gets better. 

&#x200B;

We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender. Today, at the edge of our hope, at the edge of the end of our time, we have chosen not only to believe in ourselves but in each other. Today there's not a person among us that shall stand alone. Today we face the monsters that are at our door. Today we are cancelling the apocalypse!
Worse., but I don‚Äôt care anymore.
I think it's going to get worse before it gets better. When I came out 17 years ago it was bad when people found out you were trans. But back then trans was an after thought. Now trans is much more well known and everybody has a opinion on it. Trans is now a household word for the bigots as well as allies. And now that those bigots know and are vested in us they're going to fight to take away rights.
To be honest, things will definitely get worse, but it won't be forever.

What we need right now is for Democrats to give a shit. That's the frustrating part of it to me, they're willing to offers us up like sacrifices to get the support of centrists but that's not fair to us and it doesn't even work anyway so they shouldn't be trying.
Maybe
Tbh I think I still got a ways b4 I be ok even tho things are going really well omg especially a other transgirl we gotten close now she's happy for me and I am same for her but there other things I still need to reach
Worse, I think as soon as my business here In Tennessee is done which is about a year, I‚Äôll be  retreating to a nice blue area close to Canada, in case I need to make a dash to avoid Gilead.
I don‚Äôt find predicting the future productive for me. Most problems feel way to big for me to make a serious contribution to solutions, so I try to limit a bit how much I engage with them and instead focus on smaller bits I can help with. I have no idea how to run stuff, but if I find a petition I agree with I sign it and maybe send it to a friend. Most people I talk with are very pro-LGBTQ+, but if people are more tentative allys I might try to give them a small push in the right direction. Stuff like that
I think the current wave will pass eventually, the mob will get it out of their system, we‚Äôll mourn our losses for a time, and  then we‚Äôll get to work repairing things.  It‚Äôs two steps forward, one step backwards.  But we *are* moving forwards.

And I mean, our community has survived for centuries.  Every so often they have a witch hunt and try to purge us.  We all suffer, some of us die, but they ultimately fail and we rebuild.
If I am to be completely honest I believe it will I am a republican white man dating a trans boy who is the love of my life. He prefers to go by he and keep his feminine body which I do enjoy and prefer. But considering I am who I am and I changed my ideologies for this one person who was doing things I was against at one point, but now I‚Äôm not against it there are some disagreements but we all have a right to an opinion and the way I see it is that people will see it‚Äôs not bad and it will get better for all of us.
Idk I try to look at it as an experience. Some sort of journey. Both the past and the future will have its struggles, but those will be accompanied by amazing times as well. So I try not to dwell on it too much.
It will get worse. Rethuglicans are empowered and emboldened and blue cult is now concerned about crisis find raising to pretend to fight back.

If Bleu cult actually wanted to make anything better there's a crap ton of legislation that would put the scum against the wall.  Remove church tax exemption. Make attacks on trans folks federal hate crimes. Make FBI investigate family courts abusing trans families.
Honestly things will get worse for awhile but IMHO we're past the worst of it.  As much as things are getting worse in red states they're getting better in blue ones.  10 years ago if the GQP passed the sort of shit laws they do today they would have done so with barely a comment from the public let alone the media while today, sure the law passes but there are protests and lawsuits to stop their implementation.

That's not to say it will get better overnight or that things can't start backsliding in general but there's hope that the worst is behind us.  We just need to work to keep making things better
I feel like the worst is going to get worst, and the best is going to get better. Like to an extreme, then things will go to normal. Same happened with gay acceptance, after gay marriage laws were passed most people calmed their tits about it.
This 100% this.  The most important thing you can do is to vote.  Every election state, local or federal, make sure you vote.  Not liking the options is no reason to stay home, it's a reason to run for office yourself and make sure that next time there's a good candidate to vote for
What is that from?
As in out of office?
I love this and that you opened your heart
Attacks on trans isn't a hate crime?  I am genuinely asking because I thought it was and should be.  Can someone educate me please?

Got correctly gendered today for the first time	"Very minor win here,

Went to my first ever pride event as an out trans woman	"Positives- the person at my table was a nice Australian woman and we got along smashingly, plus the Samba dancers were very nice and we chatted up a storm.  
Negatives- the folks at the next table over (I do not know for sure, but I read as four cis-hetero folk in two couples) spent most of the night circle jerking among themselves about common transphobic talking points (trans trenders, TikTok 'brainwashing' kids, how unfair sports are when trans athletes participate, ""male brain""/""male socialization"") and then insult to injury they proceeded to win about 2/3rds of the raffle prizes.

Americans, what do we do?	"I live in a southern state that has seen dangerous legislation submitted and approved which targets our community and will cause a lot of harm. The state system is overrun with religious fanatics who view us as predators and not as people. I‚Äôm not a fighter, I‚Äôd rather run to another state if the law tries to force me to detransition than stay and fight for progress while suffering, but I know I‚Äôll feel guilty about the people who can‚Äôt leave. I also know that it‚Äôs what they want, to make us feel unsafe so we leave and they can keep winning elections and pushing harsher, more violent laws.

I don‚Äôt want to leave, I like living where I live, but the thought of expressing myself and being vulnerable when I can only see a dangerous future is making it so hard to stay hopeful. I don‚Äôt have time, energy, or money to donate, I don‚Äôt have a voice here and it feels like my votes are constantly flushed away by a flood of ignorant bigots. What do we do?"	"I'm sure most Ukrainian refugees loved living in their country and didn't want to leave.  They left anyway because it gave them their best chance for survival.  When things improve many of them will return.  Red States aren't much different if you're trans. You can always go back.
I've been asking myself that same question. It's been hard to cope with it all. I don't have the foggiest idea what to do. Maybe move to Minnesota.
Right now your own existence is an act of defiance against these assholes. Do what you can to protect yourself from them so you can live to keep fighting tomorrow.

Any trans people living in red areas need to get the holy fuck out if it is at all possible. You can keep fighting for those who haven't escaped from somewhere else. And you'll have more time and freedom to do that if you aren't in immediate danger yourself. Get out, aim for the strongest cities in the deepest blue states you possibly can.

Our individual votes are pretty much irrelevant here. Our only real hope is hoping that our ""cis allies"" actually step up. We need them to fight this shit because we can't win it alone. And they can stay in the red states and fight so that their trans friends and loved ones can return. If anything your impact will be greater in that regard if your cis friends and family see that the state has become so dangerous for you that you have to leave. 

Also get any medical care you can while you can. Talk to your doctor about possibly stocking up on hrt. If you've been planning on updating ID, do it now if possible. Save money, if you can. Get yourself in as secure a position as you possibly can.

And honestly just exist as a trans person. And talk to people. Our community exists almost entirely online. This is where we interact with each other en masse. We're all watching this catastrophe unfold, some of us in more immediate danger than others but everyone affected by it. Just talking about it here helps I think. Where else are we going to talk about it, and who with? We can help each other at least a little bit just by having people to talk to who know what is happening.
It's easier to help out if you're alive and well, is my thinking. Establish yourself somewhere safe, do what you need to do for your mental and physical health, and then you can start finding ways to help out your home state. Staying and sacrificing your mental and potentially physical health doesn't help anyone, least of all yourself. Making sure you're safe gives you the chance to help those who can't leave. It's like how on planes they always tell you to put the oxygen mask on yourself first, and then help those who may not be able to do it for themselves: you can't do anything to help them if you're passed out from hypoxia. The same thing applies to mental health and safety.

I'm from Texas, so I 100% understand what you're going through. I'm getting things in order to leave, myself. Therapy's taught me when a situation is more than I can handle.

i'm moving *back* to Minnesota - for other reasons, but what really sealed the deal for me was the recent trans refuge legislation they're hearing currently. MN is really progressive and doesn't really give 0 f**ks, preferring to pave their own way. 

it's safer to leave hostile states imo. having that constant anxiety & fear in the back of my mind isn't worth it.
If you can go to a blue state, that‚Äôs probably a good call. Don‚Äôt let survivorship guilt affect your decision, you need to do what‚Äôs best for your own safety
It might sound strange, but what I do is have faith in the rising generation. It helps that I teach: I feel like I'm making a difference even when activism and voting seem pointless.
I‚Äôm concerned at all the sentiment to go to CA all the time. I‚Äôve spent time on the west coast and for a refugee fleeing with only their possessions, that‚Äôs a financial hardship (CA is one of the most expensive places to live) most can‚Äôt afford or even fathom this option. So better options are needed me thinks‚Ä¶
The worry, I think, is that it might not improve. I know that‚Äôs pessimistic but it‚Äôs not an impossibility.
My wife and I are thinking of Michigan, both because they‚Äôre passing protections and the proximity to Canada‚Ä¶
If the red states don't improve, it will be even more important to not live there anymore.

It's horrible that people are being driven from their homes, but it might be the safest option.
Just come to California. As much as the conservatives hate it, being the 5th largest global economy on our own allows us a lot of leeway when being independent and pushing more progressive agendas. We also have almost every climate imaginable so pick where you wave to live.
I believe things will improve once Gen Z and Gen Alpha leverage their political clout.  Maybe a decade from now but hopefully sooner.  Those generations overwhelmingly support trans rights.  We need to vote these scumbag politicians out of office.  That's the key to fixing things.  Apathy (not voting) keeps them in office.

(TW: Suicide) It just feels impossible...	"If I'm really trans like I think I am then there is really nothing left for me to do.... HRT offers hope sure but in reality its just as out of reach as my wish to be a girl has always been... its just a hope built on wishes and miracles nothing that can be achieved... at least not by me.

Everyone will hate me if they knew... no one will ever accept me as a girl... I'm too scared to say how much I want to be one or how much I've always wanted to be one... 

I've always been alone, I've never had friends, no one likes me, I've spent my whole life hiding in the shadows, I can't take it anymore...

But if everything stems back to me being trans if its the root of all my problems then I just don't know what to do. I can't transition its probably impossible, it'd be so hard and scary, there'd be no one by my side... I just couldn't take it... I only really see one option and it's probably the most realistic one... at least it'd solve everything... nothing would hurt anymore... this long fight could finally be over... it's not like there was ever a chance of me winning... nothing matters anyways... my wish still feels just as impossible as always, but if it has to come true for me to finally be happy and free then I guess I never will be... there's just no point... nothings ever going to work out... I'd probably be better off if I just did it already..."	"Please don't take that option.
  You are a valid person. You will be loved for who you really are when you're ready to be that person. And you CAN be that person, you are allowed to be her. It is totally ok to be you honey.
  Even tho right now it seems like an impossible mountain, it won't always be. 
 You deserve to be happy, and to be happy, you need to be who you are.
Please sweetheart speak to a therapist, talk to them about how you feel, and get some professional support.  You do not have to feel the way that you do right now.
  You''re in the r/trans family now and We love you,  and in-time you'll learn to love yourself, but you have to start by accepting yourself and allowing yourself to be who you are. Honestly seek out a therapist, it will help you soooooo much. 
Dm me here if you need to talk honey.
I felt like you do for years so I know how hard life can be when you feel so alone and hopeless. I thought that everyone would hate me if I transitioned, that there was something fundamentally wrong with me that everyone could see, and that I should just end my miserable life. I can tell you this: you owe it to yourself to try. You think everyone will hate you, but people will sometimes surprise you. Even if everyone you know hates you for transitioning, all that means is that you know a lot of shitty people and you should cut them out of your life. I guarantee that you'll find people who will accept and love you for who you are.

Can transition without someone to support you be hard and scary? Yes. But you'll never know if you can do it if you don't try. You may find that people you know are more accepting than you think. And if you're truly alone, look for LGBTQ+ groups in your area; they often host events where you would probably fit right in and make some new friends.

If your choices are ""definitely dying"" and ""possibly having a hard road to finally being happy"", then I'd say take the second choice. Just *try* before you give up. I did and I finally feel like a normal person.
Don‚Äôt do it. I know you are in a bad place rn, it pass. Transition will not solve all your problem, and for some time it will put more weight on your shoulder. But if that‚Äôs what you want, it can change your view of life. See that there is a light, far far away of course, but you will know that now you have a direction. And everything will seem less hard do it. I promise. If you want we can talk.
Please know that things will get better.

I was exactly where you are.  Transition actually helped me a lot.  Yes!  It was VERY hard..  I didn't think anyone would accept me.  Some didn't.  But, many surprised me,and did accept me.

Try taking baby steps.  Order clothes online and dress in private for a while.  Then, make very short appearances in public away from where you live, etc.  HRT can come at any time or no time at all.  I started with herbal estrogens, which only have a little bit of estrogen and later migrated to prescription hormones.  Everyone's own transition process is unique to themself.

Everyone on here would probably agree that transition is a very scary process, but very worth it for mental health and happiness!
I love you. And there are others that love you. Please don't go that way. Show the world what you are, no matter how impossible it may seem. Ignore the easy jokes from people. Just *be you*. People *will* gravitate towards you. Maybe move to somewhere lgbtq friendly to up your chances if that's financially possible. If not, you will *always*, have allies online.
I tired before to get one... they are so expensive... and I ended up missing the intake call from them and couldn't work up the courage to even call back.... I don't know if I could talk about it...
I know how terrifying it seems to even open up and tell a therapist about it all, but I also know how much it will help you. NGL  it won't fix everything- but it WILL make a big difference, and that will give you some breathing space to learn to be comfortable with who you are.  PLEASE call that therapist back, even if you missed their call, they'll still be happy to help you.  Please call them back.

I came out in the worst possible way and time and I just had the darkest night in my life.	"  

I'm at a complete and utter loss of what to do now. In just two short weeks everything in my life came crumbling down in an instant. I feel so fucking hopeless about the future right now. I'm sorry this is a bit lengthy. But I feel like screaming into the void and hoping someone will listen is better than bottling this up. It's split into three main issues that are making it hard to even get over one of them.

I(28m?) recently came out to my friends as trans, and I never thought I would. It was more reactionary than anything really, because I was terrified that I was losing my closest friend because she thought I still had romantic feelings for her. These circumstances were not ideal in any way and now it feels like everything is piling into itself. Everything feels way more real since I came out. The fake personality I put on in public feels like it's impossible to maintain now. I've always been more emotional than most guys, but now it's just insane. During work I can't even keep it together anymore and I'm worried I'm going to lose my job.

For a bit of context, a few years back I started dating my best friend for two years. It didn't work out and we went no contact for a little over a year. During this year of no contact, I finally accepted I was trans instead of denying it, but decided I never was going to tell anyone or act on it. Part of me knew since middle school, but I just refused to accept it as anything more than a fetish. I wish more then anything I told her at literally any stage of our friendship.

When we reconnected, we became best friends again, and it made it clear it was just as friends not as anything more. I agreed with it, and it only took me a few weeks to know I couldn't even feel that way about her anymore anyways. I literally felt closer to her in this iteration of our friendship than ever before. I wanted to always tell her, but I never worked up the courage too. I just kept repressing it for fear of losing my best friend again, let alone if others in my life found out. Without the overlaying romantic feelings, or fear of messing up that kind of relationship, I was honestly the happiest I have ever been in any iteration of our friendship.

Two weeks ago, she decided to let me know she was seeing someone else. I was honestly extremely happy for her. Then the conversation turned very similar to the post break up talk. It sounded like she thought I still had those kinds of feelings for her and was trying to cut me out of her life. I didn't say anything at the time and just congratulated her and told her to go for it and be happy. But it didn't sit well with me at all. I felt like I was losing my best friend over a misunderstanding. I decided I would rather lose her for her having a bad reaction to her finding out I'm trans then over a misunderstanding.

I spent the next week telling people close to me before I told her, to varying degrees of acceptance, and only a couple bad reactions. I thought I was ready to tell her but figured she wouldn't let me say it in person. If she thought, I was still capable of those types of feelings for her I figured she would think it was some dumb attempt to win her back. So, I opted to tell her over text.

It did not go well. She was pissed I was being vague when I tried to be precise in as short of text as possible. She was pissed because she thought I was trying to take back the green light of her new relationship. Most of all she was pissed because I lied to her for years about this.

The last one hurts the most because I don't know if she's right or not. When we were together, I felt like I could go either way. It wasn't until we went no contact that I finally accepted it. When we became friends again, I wanted to tell her, but it was extremely hard to even approach. I regret more than anything not doing so. I always saw her as the core of my support group if I did manage to come out, and now I‚Äôm not even sure if she wants me in her life at all. Was I really lying to her, or was I lying to myself more?

So now what?

I lost my best friend, the person I felt I could tell anything, but didn't. My friends either are distancing themselves from me or don't understand. My support group feels shattered when I need it the most.

I think having to explain this to people has in some way made me more rapidly internalize things. Things that used to be minor annoyances are now extremely heart wrenching to me. Facial hair? Despise it. Looking at myself in the mirror? Nauseating. Having to put on men's dress clothes for work? I threw up forcing myself to the other morning. Everything is just starting to feel so much more real and painful now that my public fake self is fading away.

I never gave much thought about what I would do if I came out. Since I couldn't tell my best friend I figured I wouldn't tell anybody. Why think past the first step if you can‚Äôt even approach the hurdle? Transitioning was the furthest thing on my mind because I never thought it would work. Now I'm regretting everything. I was never happy with my appearance and knew I probably never would be. I just stopped caring. I almost hit 300 lbs at one point, I'm almost 30, balding, and I'm 6 foot. Just a horrible person because I could never stick to some sort of plan. I always knew I would never be happy with the result after years of hard work, so I always gave up. If I started years ago maybe I could have put an effort in, but I feel like that ship has passed.

I keep having this dream now, with only minor variations. I'm just going throughout my day without even realizing it's a dream until I see a mirror or reflection. It's not me. It's someone I can never be. And before I can even comprehend, I always wake up and am just utterly devastated. The hair may be a different style, might be wearing something else, but that face is always the same. I‚Äôm starting to see it during the day and it‚Äôs ruining me. I would trade almost anything in the world to trade places with her.

Just minor thing after minor thing is driving me insane. Stupid jealousy on things like the women at work being able to wear professional dresses, being able to show emotion without getting the dead awful stares and whispers. Just so many little things I'll never be able to fully list out.

Then to top everything off, my car caught fire and is now completely totaled. I was not in a financial situation to be able to afford this even remotely. Every single credit loan I've applied for rejected me. Can't even apply for their minimums. So, I'm shit out of luck living in rural south Dakota without a vehicle. Being rejected on every loan really scares me. What if I transition? How will I even afford this if my finances are even worse than I thought? What about the future? I probably won't ever get a house, or anything substantial for a life achievement. Not to mention since this state is a hellhole, I would never be able to come out at work without my work life being ruined.

Any one of these would already be extremely hard to deal with on my own. But all these at once is shattering me, and my support group is fractured.

That brings me to last night. Horrible morning at work, got rejected from another auto loan in the morning, and it was my best friend's birthday. I tried to reach out to wish her well, and only got short answers akin to go away I don't care anymore. Finished up my day to try for another auto loan to just get rejected on the spot.

The night was probably the darkest night I have ever had, and I have attempted suicide before for less. If it wasn't the fact that I didn't want to stain the day for my friend, I don't think I would be here right now. I‚Äôm slightly better today but I‚Äôm scared of what happens next time when a birthday doesn‚Äôt stop me. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even hoping to accomplish by posting this. It‚Äôs some form of self-therapy to write this out for myself, I guess. To just try and see where I went wrong. I wish I told her sooner, and now I regret telling her at all. I don‚Äôt want to interrupt her new relationship, and I feel awful for being selfish and trying to maintain the closest bond I‚Äôve ever form when its clear that bond didn‚Äôt mean the same to her. I just wish we could remain friends, but I don‚Äôt believe she even wants that. I feel used, I feel like my trust is meaningless, and I don‚Äôt know who I can even trust anymore if I didn‚Äôt see this coming. 

If you managed to actually read all this for a stranger you will never meet, thank you. If just one person can offer insight, I think the pain of typing this up might have been worth it. 

TL;DR I came out reactionary and everything is going to shit in my life rapidly. I lost my friends, including my best friend, my outlook on everything is changing and it hurts, and to top it off my car catching fire is really hammering in how financially ruined I am."	"A factor that seems to be missing is that you took your friend's agency when you assumed what she was thinking rather than communicate what you were thinking.  She may or may not have been thinking you were still pining for her, but you did not allow her to tell you what she was thinking.  You did her ""thinking"" for her and then reacted to your projected thoughts.  At this point, she could be mad at you for numerous reasons, but you can never truly know as you are not communicating, you are assuming.  

The only solution I see here is to own it.  Send her an email acknowledging the above as well as what you wrote in your post.  Then get out of the way and hope that she feels your past friendship is worth continuing the conversation.  It sucks losing friends.  But you had good intentions when wishing her well in her relationship.  If it has to end, end it on a high note and cherish the good memories you have of your friendship.  If it tries to grow, give it space to rebuild trust.  She doesn't know the REAL you.  Odds are high you also do not know the REAL her.  Hitting 'do-over' can work wonders.
Cliche incoming

It's always darkest right before dawn.


When I left home after graduation ( high school) to go to college, I told very few people that I was trans/sissy. My family all but disowned me ( thank goodness for scholarships). My friend's left me , except my best girl friend. It was hard to move states to go to college after, but I am 3 years into school, and I am happier than ever. It took probably 8 months to realize I needed to move on, and I started going to the ""gay"" bar and having a good time. Im sorry your friend is all like she is. I'm here for support if you need someone to talk to.
I know that this feels all consuming and catastrophic right now, but you can ride this out. You might consider looking into online/virtual support groups. Maybe it will help to hear stories of others who have been where you are and are getting through it and shaping another life.
Getting it all out is good, I think. Bottling things up never ends well, in my experience.

I'm sorry you're going through all of this, and I do hope things will get better for you soon. I think they will.

Your friendship with your best friend sounds like it hasn't been healthy for quite a while. It's really hard to lose friends; I lost ties with one very dear to me recently. It hurts a lot, even if the friendship was causing us pain. You will make new friends; it's almost inevitable. Give it time, and new people will come into your life.

I don't think you should write transition off 100%. Ultimately, whether you decide to or not is completely up to you, and remember that it's okay to change your mind in either direction. Most importantly, whether you transition or not, I think it's important to start living as yourself. You mentioned having a personality you put on that's become difficult to keep up in the wake of everything (paraphrasing here). It's going to be confusing and maybe even shocking to the people in your life to stop playing that role, but I don't think there is any true benefit to keeping that fa√ßade up. Whether you live as a man, woman, or any other gender, you would benefit a lot from letting your true personality come through. I think you'll attract friends that will be more supportive and more understanding of how you're current feeling, if nothing else.

It's never going to be easy, but things are going to get better. I sincerely believe that.
That... makes a lot of sense from a different perspective. I always tend to assume the worst in these scenarios. Thank you for that.

Finally Accepted Who I Am	"On an alt so I can have a kinda female trans account separate from my main that I'm not out on.

To be completely honest, me being trans had been something in the back of my head that I just ignored for a while. I cast aside the feminine parts of myself because wanting to go into music means that I'd always have to be a guy due to my voice type.

But after finally thinking about it in college, and picking out a name, I'm really starting to like myself again. The little smiles when I hear someone call me Cecilia, or when my girlfriend calls me her girlfriend, and people calling me by the right name. Hell, even on my alt account on discord that I made, seeing a username based on my new name rather than my old one next to all the messages I send makes me feel really happy.

I know that things are going to be hard due to the fact that transphobia in the dad's side of the family is rampant, but things are already feeling a bit better and so far everyone I've come out to has been really accepting of everything!

Anyways, my name is Cecilia, I'm mtf and only use she/her! I'm glad to finally be out, even if it's just on an alt account for now. Any advice for things to know for the future would be appreciated, but I just kinda wanted to celebrate this little win after nearly 19 years.

It feels good."	"Congrats, hello and welcome, Cecilia! ü•≥üéâüëèüèª

Millennials and Gen Z are you as confused as I am with all this transphobia that‚Äôs running crazy?	"What the F is going on? I‚Äôm on the younger side of our M generation and hang mostly with Gen Z and younger Millennials. But I am having a hard time understanding this out right attack on trans people and ESPECIALLY trans kids. 

I always try and look at both sides of the coin to gain at least, an understanding. I may hate it and not agree, but I can still see the weight of water. 

This!? Why? What does it matter to cis people what trans people do? Why can‚Äôt they see transitioning SAVES kids lives?

It‚Äôs literally only evil. That‚Äôs all I can see out of this‚Ä¶. Evil. 

I live in a conservative southern state. It‚Äôs gone slightly purple‚Ä¶. But I don‚Äôt think that will hold up. It will slide right back red, due to all the new younger red conservatives BEING GROOMED and brainwashed and indoctrinated into insanity. 

I‚Äôm stealth (mtf) and am not targeted in the open. But people thinking I‚Äôm cis female ain‚Äôt all it‚Äôs cracked up to be down here. People talk shit to me about trans people and I end up usually exploding on them. 

Like I can‚Äôt converse with people who are so hateful and try and win them over. Like, it‚Äôs deadass impossible. They just believe we are the evil. But WHY?

Ngl, I really felt it was just older peeps thinking like this. But it‚Äôs not, at least here. 

In the city here it‚Äôs pretty great, but ohhhhhh shit the burbs are not great at all. 

I went to dinner today wayyyy out in the sticks with my fam. My brother lives out there. I overheard a table near us of people my freakin age just hammering trans people and trans equality. 

Two of the dudes were smiling and light flirting at me as they talked when they noticed my eye contact with them. 

I almost puked! 

Sooooo‚Ä¶..I went to the bathroom and on the way I leaned on their table, stopped and said ‚Äúya know, you never can tell when a trans person might be leaning on your table that you were just flirting, smiling and giving creep eyes at. But I guess hot is hot, riiiight?‚Äù

Food fell out their open mouths. 

Idc about blowing my own cover, I won‚Äôt be returning to that area. 

Millennials how are your peers where you live/work? Cause I‚Äôm concerned with mine and their growing open transphobia üò§"	"We all don‚Äôt understand what is going on across generations. I find it so confusing that we are not like soooooo much further in our discussion. It is 2023 and we are still asking parents which body parts we should cut off, when they have an intersex baby. That is how far we still are in mental Middle-ages.
It‚Äôs concerning in some ways, but I think that we can prevail. Gay people did against similar issues. Yes, they will try to brainwash people. They certainly did to me and that didn‚Äôt work. My mom used to get so angry when I defended gay people. The important thing is we have to try and be outreach to the people who don‚Äôt really hate us. Help them understand that we are just normal people and not what we are made out to be. We can win the propaganda war.
Nah I had no faith or pride in my country since I hit age 9. Nothing that we do surprises me at this point
The way I see it, in 2014 the right wing realised they had lost the battle (for now) against the LGB part of the Alphabet Mafia with gay marriage being legalised in the US.

Just after that, Transpeople started to get more visibility, and then fast forward to 2020 when Trump lost the election‚Ä¶ now there is a new target, a recent loss, and the need for a new culture war to distract from real issues that can go for the next 20 years or so until all this gets over turned‚Ä¶we‚Äôre basically at the mid-90‚Äôs point for gay rights‚Ä¶

It makes a sick sense when you think of it like that‚Ä¶
The bigots are going after the bodily autonomy of anyone who isn't a cishet white (preferably rich) man. In their opinion, the""minorities"" (there are more of us than there are of them) have been treated like people for too long. We'll get through it, although I fear there'll be some blood before it's over
Sadly it seems to be a trend sweeping the western world to some extent. I‚Äôm from the UK and I‚Äôm disgusted by the trends of the last 10 years. I can only assume it‚Äôs due to general political and economic volatility - minorities become scape goats just to take focus off other real problems. I‚Äôve never understood the hatred towards trans people!
The mind of a bigot is pretty simple. They need something to lash out at because they're dealing with their own unresolved trauma. It causes the soul to be poisoned and requires one of two things. 

1) Address the trauma, unpack it, work through it, heal, feel better.  
2) Pretend it isn't there and lash out at others so you can leak it. If you cannot do 1) then you MUST do 2)

These people are usually believers in God and Christianity (Religious right tends to support Far Right GOP ideology). This religion teaches that God will remove your pain and make you feel whole. It's a good promise but there's one fatal flaw...God doesn't exist. 

This forces the victims to do mental gymnastics in order to explain their internal pain. If God is real, and I trust God, then God would remove my pain. Therefore, if I still feel pain that MUST be something else, because God would have fixed me using supernatural means. This usually manifests in the belief that all humans have a sinful nature and only God can fix us. We sometimes sin because it's inevitable but that's why there's a get out of jail free card, forgiveness.  

This belief chains them to a life of misery because they don't think they have any pain that CAN be fixed. The lack of admission and belief that they are supernaturally charged to be good people means they commit hurt in secret and project it. It's not a healthy way to live. I've been on both sides of the fence so I can speak from personal experience in GOP mindsets
i‚Äôm ashamed i went to iraq for this country
Yeah for what it's worth I am In a rural area of a consistently blue state and it's a fuckin mess here... like there is a lot of fear that there is some kind of culture war happening and it's really hard to convince them that the shit just isn't that deep... apart from just trying to exist I mainly just don't want to be perceived...
I can relate to that indeed.
Well said, very well said.
[removed]
I guess I look at it completely different cause it just keeps on surprising me, especially from my generation and younger. I‚Äôm like wtf dude?!
See that rings very true to me. Trans people started being out per say, in pop culture and started (as we should) pushing for equality and human rights. And then the biiiig push back started. It‚Äôs almost like some cis people were like okay trans people, you couldn‚Äôt just stay quiet and exist, you haaaaad to get loud and proud‚Ä¶.. now you will experience STOMP STOMP STOMP bitches cause your mouths couldn‚Äôt stay shut. 

Literally I have heard this said by trans bashers!
I get that part of it. It‚Äôs the complex irrational hatred that has me buggerd completely. Hate comes from foundations that get built up on, but how do trans people get slapped down on those foundations of hate. Is it just the ol hate what one cannot understand or is different?????
That‚Äôs a good point. Talk shit about your neighbor‚Äôs soup, while your own soup is made of actual SHIT! üò§
Religious beliefs are great when they are an idea, but you can change an idea but not a belief. Idk who said that but it‚Äôs always stuck in my head. I think it was from that old Kevin Smith movie Dogma.
üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
Exactly!!!!! Exactly! It‚Äôs not that fucking deep y‚Äôall. Why are you all up in our business pretending our shit matters one single bit to your lives????!!!!!! 

I don‚Äôt get it!
Frankly speaking we also can blame the media on that i like to read the news about things out of my country and ohhh boy they really like to make you people look like villains.

Like seriously all the sexual assault the drama the pedofiles and stuff like that then i ask to myself when was the last time i saw something good about trans and the answer was never.

Never i read something good about trans never i saw something good that came out of the moviment just bad stuff.

And when you are served with a plate full of bad things and nothing good on it well..... People tend to hate it.
Why are you spamming your own post, are you a bot?
People like having a scapegoat, someone to direct their anger at. Things have steadily getting worse as capitalism has been failing for a couple decades now and the powers that be are scared because the masses are cottoning into the fact that we've been lied to. We're watching the fall of Rome part 2: straight to video release. At least Rome knew enough to try and keep their citizens fed and entertained, here we're all barely making rent and the assholes in charge are just pointing out acceptable targets to hate crime. It's just a continuation of what Regan and Thatcher were doing in the 80s

Yesterday, I did my first live performance...as my real name	"Back story.
I am 15, still a good time away from HRT but almost everyone knows that I am trans and that im by far, not a boy at all. One day, I saw that there was a singing competition coming up and I decided to participate in it but as your girl Isabel is, she decided that she was participating with her real name and not her deadname.
And against the popular belief, it all went well.
I was never referenced by he/him, always she/her (im from Portugal so it was ela/dela) at all times and it rlly solidified to myself how androgynous my presence and appearance was.
Once the competition came around, I was scared because a lot of my family was there in the public and I knew that they would say ""Isa"" (its short for Isabel and I use it rlly often) instead of my deadname. I had told my mom and my stepdad that i was gonna be called by Isa and they were pretty ok with it but my grannies were there and I felt a little frightened. Even though I tell them I am a girl since 9 yrs old, it would be the first time they would actually encounter me without my deadname.

The show was great. I didn't win but i dont care.
I had a lot of fun and I learned a lot.
I was happy that in the first time I performed alone in a stage (i had done it before but in an orchestra playing double bass), I was doing it as a girl.

Funnily enough, one of the winners was gay and him and his bf came up to me (next to my parents lol) and said ""Please Isa, dont ever give up because there  are almost anyone like you and like us who have the courage to be themselves so please, don't hide girl"".

It wasn't drag night, but I wanted to check it out anyway..... as me. Separate from all that it‚Äôs a super cool place. All the wood work is reclaimed wood from antique sailing vessels from the Mystic Seaport Museum. 

When I got there the owner (lesbian) was working the front desk and could obviously tell am trans and looked a bit nervous. So she said, hi hun you doing ok? Reading that she knew what was going on, I told her it was my first time out. She was super excited for me and walked with me over to the bar and asked me what I was having, I told her gin and tonic. She waved the bartender over, (Giant Jason Mamoa looking MF) he said, evening miss, and the owner said she'll have a gin and tonic. Affirmation overload.... lol. We sat and talked for a bit. Once she saw I was ok she left. I had a couple more drinks then headed home. I'd call that a resounding win!!!"	Let's gooooo	xcvtir	trans	20	0.87	2022-09-13 02:43:16
My Friend Crossed a Line	"As the title suggests, my friend kinda crossed a line when I was playing video games tonight with them and one of my roommate's online friends (fyi this friend who crossed a line is not my roommate). I'm not sure how he got onto this topic, but my friend went and told my roommate's online friend my dead name, which really felt like a stab in the back. As soon as I realized he was gonna say my dead name, I started trying to get his attention as a hint to not say it, but of course he finished his thought before paying attention to me. I swear he misses all social cues, which isn't his fault. Some people aren't capable of catching social cues. When I asked him why he went and said my dead name, he said he has trans friends who don't have an issue with him telling people their dead names. Cool, that's great for them, but I have an issue with it. I'm haunted by that name every day. I really don't need people, who don't need to know, knowing my dead name. Other than for legal purposes, if I want someone to know my dead name, I'll tell them. I did try to tell him that most trans people won't want him to tell others their dead names, but he wouldn't listen. On that note, I'm sorry to everyone here. He still thinks sharing other peoples' dead names is okay. All I can do at this point is hope he's proven wrong someday. Another attempt he made to make what he said okay was by saying that people who need to know my name for legal purposes (like for jobs) they'll use my dead name. I mean, he's got a point. One, if they were decent human beings, they'd use my preferred name, but most people are decent human being's anymore so he's right, they probably would use my dead name. Two, so what? This wasn't a case where they had to know my legal name. This other person didn't need to know my dead name. There was any legal reasons as to why they would have needed to know that. There was no requirement saying my friend had to share that info with them. My friend had no right to share that info. Anyway, after I realized there was no winning this, I shut up, let him make his point, and he went on to something else and I have no idea what it was. After he moved on, I just dm'd him on discord explaining that I didn't want him giving out my dead name. I did that to avoid making it any more awkward for the other person in the discord. After a moment, my friend randomly said something along the lines of, ""Whatever. I don't care."" Now, he could've been saying this to me, but it also would've made sense to say it to the game since I think he might've been going through a cutscene. I just went with the possibility of him saying it to the game since it rested easier in my mind."	"he's clearly not a friend if he thinks it's okay to share your deadname
he doesn't care that he is in the wrong and he doesn't want to admit it. you clearly told him it was not okay and tried to explain, and he just argued against it. that's not a friend. you could give him one last chance, set a boundary by saying you can't continue this friendship if he isn't gonna respect you, but keep it at that last chance. he doesn't deserve more if he is so stubborn and doesn't want to admit that he's wrong. and just judging by this rather simple argument, this is definitely also gonna be an issue for bigger arguments, and he's gonna continue that pattern of behavior unless he changes how he acts.
Did he really use the equivalent of saying, ""I have a black friend, so it's okay if I make racist jokes""? What a guy.
Your friend is a prick. I'd seriously question if I wanted to continue being their friend.
... That uhh, isn't a friend. Cut them off. Maybe they'll realize their fuck up was more serious than they treated it and apologize.... And if they don't, then, they certainly weren't a friend at all in the first place.
I always try to approach something like this from a place of understanding. Most people simply don't understand or know how awful it is to drop a deadname. If you care about keeping this person as a friend you need to explain to them that this is a major violation of trust and that they need to apologize to you if they want to continue to be your friend.
Update: After trying to kindly correct my ""friend,"" we had a falling out. I have decided to severe ties with him, which really hurts as this is someone my roommate and I have known for a long time
Not understanding social situations doesn‚Äôt excuse you from consequences of not understanding them. It‚Äôs called learning.
This was my first thought, too. ""I have trans friends who are okay with it."" Are they here? I'd like to know if they're really okay with it or if they just don't call you out. If they're even real to begin with. So many people make up friends in these types of conversations as if having a single friend in a group gives you enough knowledge to generalize what everyone in that group wants and thinks.
Despite how I made him seem in this post, my friend is pretty nice, he's just apparently really misguided on this subject. I'm sorry, I'll try talking to him about it right now. If he doesn't want me to listen to me, I could just have him ask his question about this here, and he'll find out he's very much wrong."	10j6ozp	trans	22	0.86	2023-01-23 07:22:26

I went out for the first time!	"I've been questioning, experimenting and exploring at home for most of the year, and at this point, I needed to do something more. So with a close acquaintance, we picked some place that was public but also kind of anonymous still. So for lunch, we went down to the country store and coffee shop! Holy shit, this was for real! I did something!

My outfit was definitely picked for the workplace, as if it was just a lunch outing (it was). We met and drove together to the store, and got some lovely iced chai and shopped around a bit. It was hard to keep in the moment and just feel the experience. I was definitely a bit vigilant for 'looks' but honestly nobody did and the whole trip was no dramas. Eventually we just sat down in the country store cafe, chatted over drinks and had just a normal lunchtime thing. 

I'm still not too sure what I'm up to or going for - its oddly like somebody else is at the wheel and I'm along for the ride. But, I am fairly sure that that day was one of the most significant of my life. For something that was just a simple thing I've done hundreds of times.

Amy Schneider's historic 'Jeopardy!' win streak comes to an end at 40		"Long-running ‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äù champion Amy Schneider lost in an episode that aired Wednesday, ending the second-longest winning streak in the quiz show's history.

Schneider, an engineering manager from Oakland, California, was defeated by Rhone Talsma, a librarian from Chicago, who raked in $29,600 in the latest game, besting Schneider, at $19,600.

She left the show with nearly $1.4 million in winnings and had no regrets about the streak's end.

""I got about $1.2 million more than my best case scenario in my imagination,"" a smiling Schneider said moments after the stunning defeat.

Almost all of Schneider's wins had been in 2-to-1 blowouts going into Final Jeopardy, meaning the final questions figured only in how much prize money she would score.

But Wednesday's game was unusually close. Schneider led Talsma by $27,600 to $17,600 heading into the last question, under the category ""Countries of the World.""

The show wanted to know which is the only nation that ends its English spelling with an ""h"" and is also among the world's top 10 most populous countries.

Talsma correctly asked, ‚ÄúWhat is Bangladesh?‚Äù while Schneider came up blank. His winning bet of $12,000 and her losing wager of $8,000 meant a new champion was suddenly crowned.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really been an honor,‚Äù Schneider said. ‚ÄúTo know that I‚Äôm one of the most successful people at a game I‚Äôve loved since I was a kid and to know that I‚Äôm a part of its history now, I just don‚Äôt know how to process it.‚Äù

Talsma's quick trigger was key to his staying close throughout the game, Schneider said.

‚ÄúI had thought that Rhone was going to be tough going into it,‚Äù she said in a statement released by the show.

‚ÄúI loved hanging out with him, we had great conversation before the taping, but I could tell that he was here to play and that he was going to be good. I still came very close to winning, but I did feel like maybe I was slipping a little bit. And once it was clear that he was fast on the buzzer, I knew it was going to be a battle all the way.‚Äù

For much of the Double Jeopardy round, it looked as though Schneider would cruise to another easy win. At one point, she was up by $24,400 to $5,800 over Talsma.

But then Talsma nailed a late Daily Double, correctly naming the Greek goddesses of vengeance, the Furies. He doubled up from $7,800 to $15,600 and put himself in position to overtake Schneider in Final Jeopardy.

Just after the game, Schneider praised Talsma for taking the huge gamble on that Daily Double.

""It's the right thing to do but I've seen several contestant not be able to pull the trigger on that,"" she told the winner.

With nothing to lose, Talsma said he didn't think twice.

""I'm just playing for fun, I was just going to go big. Wow,"" he said.

When Talsma, sporting distinctive neon-framed glasses, took the ""Jeopardy!"" stage in Culver City, California, he had no idea he'd be facing down one of the winningest contestants in the show's history. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still in shock,‚Äù Talsma said of his victory. ‚ÄúThis is my favorite show. ... I was so excited to be here, and I just wanted to do my best. I did not expect to be facing a 40-day champion, and I was excited to maybe see someone else slay the giant. I just really didn‚Äôt think it was going to be me, so I‚Äôm thrilled.‚Äù

Schneider's success was particularly celebrated by the transgender community, as she became the first transgender contestant to make it to Tournament of Champions, which will be played this fall, and is now the highest-earning female competitor in ""Jeopardy!"" history.

Schneider's 40-game streak is second only to Ken Jennings' record streak of 74 wins.

She won $1,382,800, good for No. 4 all time in regular season play, trailing only Jennings ($2.5 million), James Holzhauer ($2.4 million) and Matt Amodio ($1.5 million).

Coincidentally, Holzhauer's run on the show was also ended by a Chicago bookworm as he was ousted by University of Chicago librarian Emma Boettcher in 2019.

Jennings, who splits ""Jeopardy!"" hosting duties with former ""Blossom"" and ""Big Bang Theory"" actor Mayim Bialik, presided over Schneider's winning streak.

""It was just so amazing to watch; like I couldn't believe what I was seeing,"" Jennings told Schneider on stage after the game. ""It was an honor to be here.""
(to be clear, I am happy she made it this far, and sad that her streak is over)
Darn, I'll miss her a ton on the show! She's a great contestant, and I was really rooting for her. Sad that she's gone, but really happy that she made it so far."	se1t6b	trans	21	0.9	2022-01-27 16:07:04

I finally managed to get into female range with voice training.	thats it thats the post just wanted to post a win for me ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°	"Congrats. Getting into the pitch for me is relatively easy staying there is hard. Sadly it only sounds like a higher pitch version of my own voice though
pitch is the first step
thin vocal folds is the second
resonance is the third and most difficult
Congratulations! My partner is looking into getting vocal training as well so it is wonderful to hear about it being successfulüòä
Grats! It pays off. I hit 99% feminine 1% androgynous today, I'm still not super happy with my voice but it's all about progress!!
I still don't understand either it those two steps
yeah it‚Äôs really hard to explain because it requires lots intricate muscles and tongue positions 
i tried by myself for a long time by myself but never really made any progress until i listened to some lessons
I think of it as hitting a tuning fork. Your vocal cords are the tuning fork, and they produce a note at some pitch. But then there's the rest of your throat, so the tuning fork is inside a metal pipe. The note echoes out of a small pipe, sounding bright and narrow, or out of a big pipe, sounding booming and cavernous. Voice training shrinks the pipe.
I've been using a few different YouTubers. *Fire into heat....* But yea tough and confusing. Get there eventually
The question I always have is how though. I can get some of it and that's a good analogy I feel
Yeah, Zei is the best.
When you swallow, your voice box moves up. That shortens your throat. When you say <feel>, your tongue is higher than saying <fall>. That shrinks your resonating mouth. With repetitive drilling, you can extract these motions and add a bit of both to everything you say."	smdu8w	trans	21	0.96	2022-02-07 01:41:22

Euphoria moment: sometimes it just takes a random act of kindness...	"Yesterday was absolutely horrible. On top of having to deal with one of my worst clients ever, a snowstorm blew in and made everything cold and miserable. Not wanting to deal with public transport, I decided to splurge on a rideshare. 

My driver was that one-in-a-million you get that isn't doing it for the money. Older gentleman, his ride totally decked out to treat his customers right. I barely register any of it, as I'm huddled up in my coat, just wanting to curl up in my bedroom/depression cave for a few hours before having to do it all over again. 

Then out of the blue, he asks me, ""What's your favorite color?"" and with a smile in his voice says, ""Don't say blue."" I answer that I like dark red, and the next thing I know, there's a red rose in my hand.   ""A Valentine's gift for the lady,"" he says. He tells me that he believes everyone deserves a little something for Valentine's, and that ""believe it or not, even a few guys have taken one!""

I was in tears. I haven't had a Valentine's anything for over 20 years now, and after a few weeks of being constantly misgendered, I'd given up even trying to look femme. This random man, who had braved the elements to provide a service for those in need, had given me a double dose of validation. Not only that I was a woman, but that as a human being, I was valued. We chatted a bit, he even got me to laugh a few times, and I spent the rest of the ride with a huge stupid smile on my face.

I know it's hard sometimes, to show kindness and caring in a world that gives us precious little of either. I know how easy it is to want to give up, to say to the world ""Fine, you win,"" and collapse into an emotional black hole; to keep your head down in shame instead of up in pride. But if we keep our heads down, we may never see the rose being handed to us.

You deserve kindness, you deserve to be loved, and you deserve to be recognized for who you are. [Let no one tell you differently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmjWUjEfatc),  most of all yourself."	thats amazing!	sqzbne	trans	16	0.88	2022-02-12 19:36:01

Absolutely agreed, I'm overjoyed about the inclusivity and diversity win, but sharing sensitive info like that just grosses me out. Confidentiality is incredibly important with such sensitive information!!
I mean I hope that's not true, but if it is its not like we haven't rioted or left the country before. And if there is a ""cure"" I'm sure nobody would take it unless forced and I doubt they can force it.

Some positive news in the world of trans people in sports	"Jamie Hunter, an openly trans woman, has won the first ever US Women's Open Snooker Championship.  The best part is all of the coverage I've seen about it has mentioned absolutely nothing about her being a trans woman, they just report it like they would as if any cis player had won.  It makes me so happy to see trans representation in my favorite sport and to see the governing body of the sport being inclusive, as well as the reporting not making her transness a key point of the coverage.  The best part too, is that snooker is a sport where physical fitness has no bearing on how well you perform, so transphobes' standard arguments about how trans women have an unfair advantage is completely null and void.  Unfortunately, instead they just go back to the old standby of misgendering her and saying that ""men"" shouldn't be allowed to compete in the women's tournament.

I came out to my mom today...	"So I (23 mtf) came out to my mom today. 

She seemed shocked despite me having told her in the past (she always assumed it was a phase). 

Then she got a little frustrated that I hadn't told her sooner (even though in the past she has always said she doesnt want to talk about this kind if thing with me and has made it clear not to talk to her about it). She even accused me of telling lies when I had said I was doing ok. For the record, other than the dysphoria I've been doing pretty well.

Then she got concerned for me about what my girlfriend would think (my GF has know for months and is my biggest support) and cost of transitioning.

Then she got quiet and said she would talk to me later. I later got a text asking if she could tell my grandparents and my father. My grandparents are gonna be a big source of drama (apparently my resting face looks pissed because my grandma always asks why I'm upset when I'm just tired). My dad is the outlier. He is a conservative, Republican, Christian, Manly-man marine. He's also one of the nicest people I know. But I know he has a bit of a temper and trouble dealing with feelings at times and coupled with his conservative views I'm concerned he's gonna have a hard time accepting me.

But for now I havent been yelled at, bullied, or disowned by my family. So while it may not be a win it isnt really a loss either.

Edit: Sorry if my posts tend to be rants/monologues. I havent started hormones yet and I'm not really comfortable posting pics yet, but I appreciate this community and its supportiveness."	"I hope everything goes well and if your family doesn‚Äôt support you at least you have your gf
Do you have the ability to say you'd like to call them and tell them first? Controlling the narrative will stop your mom from panicky reacting and saying bad things about you being trans and how big of a deal it is to her and echoing her own thoughts that she would never tell you. 

Introducing the idea to them calmly will help prepare them with a base for your mom trying to process before she goes through the phases of acceptance and will give you a chance to answer any questions they have. If they're going to know, it's better that you tell them.
That would have been a good idea. By the time I posted my post though she had already told them. I havent heard from them though. Right now I think my family is in shock. Asked my mom today if she wants to talk and she said she needs some space."	mv5i5w	trans	18	0.95	2021-04-21 01:35:53
Just wanted to share because it made me happy‚Äî	‚Äîbut I just took my first T shot in six months! I‚Äôm terrified of needles and had to have someone give me my ‚ú®Man Juice‚ú® before, but I did it myself this time, so it‚Äôs a double win!	"Congratulations!!!
I‚Äôm really proud of you! I might soon wanna go on t but im a bit scared of needles! Dumb question but does it hurt alot?
Thank you!!!
Not really! You know how a lot of vaccines hurt? It‚Äôs because of a few reasons‚Äî 1, their chemical makeup. 2, they‚Äôre intramuscular. 3, you tense up when they give them because you‚Äôre nervous. Things are different with T!

It‚Äôs got a different makeup, you have the option to do subcutaneous (so inject it into a layer of fat), and you don‚Äôt have to worry about tensing up because it won‚Äôt make a difference with a fat based area. It still hurts a little, but it‚Äôs minimal.

There‚Äôs also good news! It gets you used to needles. You lose a little of that fear, so when you go in for vaccines and stuff you don‚Äôt tense as much.

It‚Äôs also different from a blood draw because the needle is thinner and you don‚Äôt have to worry about them trying to find a vein. Veins also hurt more than subcutaneous or muscle.

Hope this helps! Also, it‚Äôs not a dumb question. :)
Your welcome!
Thanks sm for answering!this helped alot! :)"	w73ae5	trans	15	0.81	2022-07-24 19:11:03

Celebrating the smallest win	"So - I‚Äôm an older non binary person (I‚Äôm 33) I only came out 2 years ago - I live in a rural part of Australia, that for some reason, even though has a decent enough population, seems to be at least 10 years behind the progress you‚Äôd see around gender and sexual orientation type things in larger cities here. 

Anyways, I went to the movies today, I‚Äôd just cut my hair, and put a new rainbow flag/trans flag pin on - and I was at the service counter when someone else there said ‚Äúserve her...or them first‚Äù to the cashier. I know it‚Äôs such a small win, and there was a misgendering before the correct pronoun, but you have to understand I‚Äôd spent years not wanting to come out because I was afraid of how backwards it is here, and how there would ‚Äúbe no point‚Äù and could possibly be dangerous - and then two years out before someone in a public setting who I didn‚Äôt know actually got my pronouns correct. 

I‚Äôve spend two hellish years having been she/her‚Äôd and hello ladies‚Äôd when in groups by literally everyone I encounter and it finally happened! He seemed a little uncomfortable - maybe I did a bit of an exasperated face at the ‚Äúher‚Äù part first (I‚Äôm autistic so that does sometimes happen without me meaning to) maybe it was my haircut, or my new pride flag pin? (Although he was a fair distance away so I don‚Äôt know) but he... corrected himself. And I was standing there just internally dancing and celebrating. What a feeling! I hope this means that a few more people in my town are becoming a little more aware. My hopes aren‚Äôt too high though because of the previously mentioned bar of standards but honestly I‚Äôm just so happy! 

I wish I had the time and confidence to have caught up with him before he went into the movie he was going to with his kids and thanked him - because I don‚Äôt think cis folks realise how huge this can be for people who are just constantly under the barrage of misgendering, and maybe it would encourage him to continue to try and work on gender assumptions etc if there was some positive feedback. Anyways. I didn‚Äôt - but I‚Äôm sending him some extra thankful thoughts! Lol. 

Anyways, just a big old rant of a post to say yay! :) thanks for reading - if you got this far üòÇ"	"[removed]

It's Pride Month, but don't forget to take care of yourself.	"Pride Month is a special time for everyone in the LGBT+ community. This is, perhaps, when our voices are the loudest, but also when our opponents are the most toxic. 

As the opposition works harder and harder to bring us to our knees, so too must we fight harder than ever before. But it's tough. You're exhausted. We're all exhausted. I've only be speaking openly as a trans person for a few months, and I'm already exhausted. We're at this pivotal moment in our fight for equality, and the moment is going to be long.

And that's right where they want us. If we're too tired to fight, they win. So make sure you take care of yourself. Take breaks from the movement when you need to look after your mental health. Stay off social media for a weekend. Pamper yourself. Whatever helps you recharge your batteries. When I'm feeling burned out, I remind myself of the saying **""You can't take care of someone else if you don't take care of yourself""**.

We're a team. We're in this together, or not at all, and we can't take care of each other unless we take care of ourselves. Don't worry, we'll keep the flags waving while you catch your breath!"	"This brings to mind the piece of advice I've found most helpful. ""On a plane, they always say to put the oxygen mask on yourself first."" AKA you can better take care of others after you've helped yourself. For those of us who are prone to devaluing ourselves in favor of others, this can serve as a reminder and a stepping stone to a healthier way of relating to the world. 

This is a relay race, and you can tag in and out whenever you need to. Your brothers, sisters, and siblings will be here to let you catch your breath. 

Thanks for the reminder, friend."	v2rnww	trans	14	0.86	2022-06-01 21:15:34

Trying to decipher clockability in the south	"Hello, trans girl in NC. Currently it is impossible to understand where I am in my journey. The south loves to throw ""sirs"" and ""ma'ams"" at everyone, and I have noticed both of them more often. But my mother recently talked about how she doesn't like ""ma'am"" because it makes her feel old? I just got called ""sweetie"" by a clerk, which I don't think I've gotten in the past. Is this a win or am I simply looking for any positive?

Edit: Sorry, I mean passability. I don't even know if people clock me because I don't think I have a ""trans identifier,"" just a confusing mix-up of boy and girl at the moment."	"You are probably passing. I grew up in the south and if you look masc, you'll get a lot of ""bud, sport, champ, boss, chief, etc.""
I'm in NC also and for me, the thing that gets under my skin the most is the whole thing if putting Mr or Miss in front of a first name. Now I know it's a southern thing and also a form of respect, but since I started transitioning, it seems to really bother me. I don't present fully feminine at work and I haven't felt the need to tell anyone that I am trans, so I know they arent doing it to be mean. But I get it. Some of the little southern quirks and mannerisms can be really annoying
Fellow carolina trans girl here. I totally feel what you're saying. I struggle with the same thing and mind set, the south can be so difficult to simply exist in if you don't fit cultural norm. Feels like they got like radar or something. The sweetie comment i would call a win, iit's universal in these parts I feel like lol. Just keep doing you and what makes you feel good and the rest will take care of itself. Always here and in on PM's if you need girl. Hugs
I get that a lot at work, and I'm like. First of all, I'm clearly presenting fem. Second, I'm in a senior position and none of those terms are appropriate regardless of gender. It should be ""mister, ms, mrs, sir, ma'am, etc."" or my name.
Ew... I definitely feel like the mister/miss thing alludes to being old. I just don't like salutations period. I should have become a doctor.
I'm actually surprised by the no-fucks attitude. I couldn't imagine everyone minding their own business ten years ago. That's one reason I waited so long. Dressing all in black is risky enough, but I didn't care about that. I even did everything I could to at least live as a femboy. Yet taking hormones somehow felt like going overboard. Now everyone is glued to their phone. They don't care about us or even themselves.
Very sorry for your pain. I don't recall ever getting any of those gendered terms while living as a guy. I tried to be fem, but it was still obvious I wasn't a chick.
I think so too. It definitely makes me feel old. But being called Mr just bugs the hell out of me. At this stage, I'm ok with whatever pronouns get used, but Mr is just too much. I don't really know why.
Maybe you just ignore all the standard pronouns. Mr. is something not used as often, so you notice it more. But I remember every single time someone misgenders me, because that's something else to cry about when I get home."	qlwyml	trans	16	0.89	2021-11-03 15:30:47
I'm ftm and somehow my mom getting mad that I have hair on my cheeks makes me weirdly happy	"So like my parents don't get the whole being trans thing about me and basically will never gender me correctly but today my mom's dumb remark about my (admittedly small amount) of facial hair made me both laugh and euphoric.

Keep in mind that I'm pre-T still atm, I just happen to get more facial hair because of my PCOS.

Anyways my mom said that I shouldn't shave my face and that I look like a man. When I said that was the point she got mad and asked me if I wanna look like a monkey. Idk there's no winning here though considering I'll still have the hair if I don't shave lol. I'm just kind of happy about it and feel that might be why I'm getting gendered correctly in public more often.

Trans woman ordered out of court house restroom by sheriff deputy wins legal ruling			1a0mau	trans	13	0.74	2013-03-10 08:42:34
Yesterday my mom called me son for the first time	"I came out to them around 5 years ago. I had done a lot of research and watched a ton of videos about how to talk to your parents and stuff. One in particular was meant to be shown to someone's parents and talked about a lot of things i knew i never would be able to verbalize. I liked it so much i downloaded it and subtitled it so my parents could understand (it was in english and they don't speak it).  

They did not take it well, and when i offered to show them the video my mom literally said ""i don't want to see it. I don't want to know anything about this."".

At that point i realized i would never be their son. I wasn't out to the world (still am not) but i understood that i would lose my parents as soon as i decided i would not accept being seen as a girl anymore. It delayed my coming out greatly. I was in college and got scared that they would stop supporting me financially and i would end up a homeless drop out with no future. I promised myself i would come out when i had a stable job in my field and no sooner.

I have not spoken to my parents about being trans ever since. For the past 5 years we have basically just been pretending nothing happenned. 

I did promise myself i would never pretend to be something i am not again and i dress exactly how i want to, i use my binder regularly and keep my hair short. I don't look like a girl. My whole life i was always ""mistaken"" for a boy and passing comes very easily to me. 

Although i never verbally spoke about being trans to them again, i made a point of making it clear that i'm a man, through not pretending to be anything else. My mom tried to fight it a little, by offering me make up, jewelry, etc, all things i haven't used since i started being able to dress myself. Before i came out she had already accepted that i was a tomboy and stopped pushing this sort of stuff on me, coming out caused her to return to those old habits for a bit, but she mostly gave up on it again shortly.

Yesterday, she was driving me to the bus station and we were just talking about random things when she said it. It wasn't planned or anything. It was just a slip of the tongue. Honestly i would have thought i was just hearing what i wanted if it wasn't for the awkward second that followed. We didn't even acknowledge it, apart from that one second, just kept the conversation like nothing happenned.

Still. I can not begin to describe how i felt. The fact that it was a slip of the tongue just made it even better, because it feels like proof that she does see who i am even if she tries to deny it. It feels like a win, one that i desperately needed.

I have no doubt that she's going to keep fighting against it for as long as she can, but now i can be reasonably sure that i'm not going to lose my mom over this. It's just a huge weight lifted from my shoulders. She'll never understand how much this meant to me. 

I'm sorry about the huge post, i just wanted to share it with someone and figured you guys would understand better than anyone else."	she will, of course, understand how much that means to you - mom's aint't stoopid! ( well you hope not. .)	hc1g1n	trans	13	0.83	2020-06-19 14:15:56

It will always be worth it	"It's coming up to the 1 year anniversary of when I came out to myself and my ex girlfriend. 

We had already broken up but the night I told her she had started by saying  that she wanted me back and was sorry she took the time off our relationship to work on herself, I had to tell her so that I didn't deceive her. I told her my revelation and 2 months later we had parted ways as lovers and were friends. Now it seems like even the friendship is gone as well. 

I realise now that although the romantic feelings are long gone I still have grief for her company and friendship and I want her in my life. I'm aware that had I not come out We may be together, but the price has been paid.

However, although this has torn me apart I'm no longer hollow, I have a face and a name for the depression and anxiety, I'm fighting the war and I'm winning. The last year has been insurmountable but I took it days, minutes and seconds at a time. Most importantly I have no regrets.

Every day I see on this page and on traaaaaaaannnnnns brothers, sisters and siblings questioning their identity and if the price is worth it. It is, just do it run for the light and never stop. Take that first step into a larger world because you'll start to realise you're not hollow, you don't need anyone to prop you up, everything is achievable and you are beautiful."	To be honest with you, I‚Äôm going through a similar thing with a friend of mine. You got this!!! Every day is a winning day!! Going through grief of loosing a friend is really tough.

Preferred Name in Payroll System	"Hi r/trans!


I hope this post is allowed, because I am looking for your help.  ADP Workforce Now, one of the largest payroll platforms in the world, is not currently set up to allow a person's preferred name to be the name that most prominently displays throughout the system.


Currently, ADP allows both a legal name and a preferred name, but it is the legal name that is plastered everywhere when a person logs in to the website or the mobile app.  Of course the legal name must be used on pay stubs, W2s, legal documents, etc, but there's no reason if a person has given their preferred name that the software should continue to insult them by calling them something else to everyone in the company via the org chart, group timecard, evals, onboarding, LMS, etc, etc 


If your company uses ADP Workforce Now for payroll, time keeping, benefits, or HR, you can help change this by providing Product Feedback about this.  There is a link in the footer of the Workforce Now website that will allow you to do so.  If enough people say something, they are bound to correct this.


Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.



Edit to Update: I posted about this in r/payroll as well, and a redditor there walked me through a work-around so that the display name isn't linked to the Payroll Name.  HUGE WIN for our employees!  However, I remain firm that this should be a simple and intuitive process for payroll/HR administrators, which in ADP, it is not.  So, our company is ok, but what about the thousands of others that use ADP that don't know about this work-around?"	"I just started a new job and idk what system they use but I‚Äôm so relieved they don‚Äôt have my legal name plastered everywhere. It‚Äôs a serious shame on adp! My old job had that system and seeing my legal name and others seeing it always caused issues
I‚Äôll ask the question, you say preferred name over legal, why not make it your legal name so they will have to change everything in/on your file?
I'm so glad for you!  ADP should be ashamed!  Although, thanks to Reddit, I did find a solution in ADP, but it wasn't exactly straightforward.
I think many people haven't gotten to it yet, or are currently in transition, or find the legal name change process to be particularly daunting.  


This could be such a simple change for ADP that would be very relieving and inclusive for a lot of people, so why NOT do it?
Also for some people, a preferred name is a nickname or a middle name which is pretty common. In that case there's no need to have a legal name change. It's just a Josephine that goes by Josie, or a Steven jr who goes by his middle name Lee so he doesn't get mixed up with his dad. These things are perfectly valid and when something asks for your preferred name, it should be used at every possible opportunity and only passed up for legal reasons. Otherwise, what's the point? Companies should do it right, or just say they don't give a heck so we can avoid them like the plague in peace.
What was it? I‚Äôd love to know so I can pass it on to other friends
So, it sounds simple, but it's not actually very intuitive if you know the system.  


-Go in to edit the ""Name"" field and change it to the employee's preferred name.  This will change the ""Payroll Name"" field because they are linked.  Don't panic!


-Go in to the ""Payroll Name"" and change it back to the employee's legal name.  The ""Name"" field will not revert back.


-Save


-The display name will now show as the preferred name, and that is now the name you can search for the employees as well.  Hallelujah!üôå"	nbsbjn	trans	13	1.0	2021-05-13 21:47:30
How do I help post&pre-op trans youth as a white, hetero male? (caring and experienced youth worker experiencing hateful backlash b/c of orientation and race).	"I have worked with young people since I was 16, in all capacities. I've cared and cried and been to funerals which never should have happened, and walk into work each day wanting to stop another.

Right now I have three trans youth I deal with day to day (2 post, 1 pre). They hate and reject anything I might say based solely on my race, and sexual preference. In three and a half weeks, I have not finished a sentence, let alone a session of counselling (which is done individually). I'm white and hetero, what can I ever help with?

How do I breach this barrier with them? You all know we cannot change who we are. I AM ME---I know this does not devalue the love and effort I have/will give. I want them to understand that the person beneath my skin and my sexual preference has nothing to do with my skills, dedication and love for my job. I sure ain't doing this for the money-I'm doing this 'cause it's fucking right.

Help me break this wall. I'll tell you, it's a goddamn strong one, thought. I've been around the block before with all manner of issues, and come out with young adults I am so goddamn proud of.

Here though-- I cannot finish a sentence without ""white"", ""white guy"", ""privilege"" or something along the lines of ""hetero-shit"" interrupting what I'm trying to say. I currently live in a small community, but cut my social service teeth in Vancouver, BC.

I'm gonna win them over, because I've done it many times before. But I want your help with how to best do it from an approach I am not part of, and do not (*personally) understand. I am here for humans. I am here for compassion, and I return day in day out to my work because I believe love and understanding will smooth over and then/conquer all.
Your help is greatly appreciated, and immediately applied."	">They hate and reject anything I might say based solely on my race, and sexual preference.

Are you so sure it's based solely on your race and ""sexual preference,"" and not the content of your speech?  

I'm not inclined to judge people harshly based making small mistakes in language, but my eyebrows are a little raised by your frequent disclaimers of surgical status, your seeming conflation of sexual orientation with gender identity, and your use of the term ""sexual preference"" (instead of ""orientation."")

Those missteps don't mean anything by themselves, but they lead me to believe that you've had too little exposure to this community to be interacting with these youths effectively.  If that's not the case, then the language you're choosing is not doing justice to your level of queer/trans-competence and is hurting your ability to win their trust.  Based solely on this post, I'd have to guess that the the issue is not them.  It's you.

So my advice is: keep educating yourself.  And, if at all possible, try to get them help from someone else who has had more experience with this community.  It's a specialized area of care with a high learning curve...you may just not be the right guy for the job right now.
Stop making this about you. Stop making it about how ""I'll win"". 

Calm down about how they mistrust you for your identity advantages, that's just how it works. If you actually ACTUALLY care about helping marginalized communities as a white man, you need to put your hurt little white feelings away and listen. Just stop talking or giving advice and just listen. 

""But how can I help right away?"" You might not be able to do anything substantial right away. You can't just immediately understand these people. It's insulting to think you could. So watch the leaders in the community. Ask for one on one coaching from leaders, watch trans youth youtube videos. Contact LGBT youth and medical centers in big cities, like Vancouver, and ask those counsellors for advice. In some cases it might be best if you helped the youth find a different counsellor or enabled them in some way to get help elsewhere. Do anything except blame your clients.

PM me if you'd like more straight to the point advice.
The fact that you felt the need to include in your post and title the surgical status of these people makes me believe you know very little about dealing with trans people. A person's surgery status is completely irrelevant to your problems.

If you have experience counseling, then you should know techniques about how to deal with reluctant clients. Are you professionally trained? Under what circumstances are these persons in your care? Are they there by their own choice? Are you providing them with resources so they can access transgender related care? If you know nothing about trans people, then you first most need to learn from these people their needs and their goals. 
Speaking as a white, hetero cis make with lots of trans friends and dates trans women, here's my best advice....


Listen. And ask questions. If they interrupt and call you ""white,"" ""white guy,"" or talk about  ""privilege,"" listen. Ask them questions about what privileges you have they do not. Try to learn from them. Truly value their opinion. 


Guys like you or I truly have no idea what it's like to be trans. They do. Let them teach you. 


And I can tell you from my life, the other posters are correct when they say pre and post don't matter. I'm sure you're saying it from a good place and not trying to be crass, but it's a good example of what you can learn from the kids. 
I dunno. Ask them. _Listen_ to them.

For one thing if you think the important facts about a trans person are whether they're pre- or post-op? Yeah, they're gonna think you're oblivious.
Come on guys let's not get concerned about how relevant the post and pre op references are. This is someone coming to our community for help. They only mean good. Clearly they included the detail i case it was relevant. 
How does being pre or post op have any relevance at all? What about non op? From this alone, my guess is that you know very little about trans people, so anything you say, especially from a position of authority, is likely to be pretty offensive. I work with trans youths myself and I think that maybe you shouldn't try to break down their walls, but your own. 
If you want help, it would really do for you to write what exactly it was that you were trying to tell them, and what words you used exactly, when they were interrupting you.

Maybe the fault is on your side; maybe on theirs; maybe on both. But we won't know until we have the knowledge of what was being said, and as you can see, even here some people are quick to jumping to bad conclusions about what you want/mean/whatever, and the lack of information about ... pretty much everything but the fact that there are three people, about whom we don't really know anything (even their genders), and there is a problem between you and each of them, makes it hard for us to give you any specific advice and easy for people to vilify you.
Alright first off, there may be nothing you can do to help these people. If they are really so racist/sexist as to dismiss anything you say based solely on race/gender then it might just be a lost cause. What you can do is not baby them, if these people go out into the real world they are going to alienate everyone not in totally willing to walk on eggshells around them. They might also just implode when they discover that people have opinions on things that they haven't themselves experienced. Simply listening and agreeing wholeheartedly with these people on every issues is not going to help them grow. Offer any advice you may have respectfully, but don't be too afraid of offending them to say what you think is genuinely helpful.
thank you.  I think the all-caps shouting of ""I AM ME"" is a tip off that this guy's problem is that he's making it all about him... (refraining from muttering about 'typical cis hetero male' here)
[removed]
It's depressing how frequently people will jump to take take offense when it clearly wasn't meant. I wonder how many would-be allies have been turned off because they unintentionally said something offensive and someone ranted at them for it. 
Well trans youth are unlikely to have had SRS, so I think he thinks that post-op means something else. 
The words are just ‚Äúpost‚Äù and ‚Äúpre‚Äù. Considering how often trans people who aren't on hormones yet say that they are ‚Äúpre-HRT‚Äù or ‚Äúpre-everything‚Äù, one would think that ‚Äúpre HRT‚Äù and ‚Äúpost HRT starting point‚Äù would be sensible assumptions of what he meant there.

As it is now we still don't know what exactly was being said that caused those young people to interrupt, so I can't help but feel that some of the comment-posters here are way too quick in vilifying him.
Exactly I'm thankful he came to us instead of using techniques and language that were less fitting
Exactly. And I really wana help OP but in only new to trans so really don't know what to say so I encourage you please hello this person they seem to mean good
I think it's a cis person defining trans people by the condition of their genitals, which is disgusting. 
Don't jump to get your knickers in a twist about it. Consider it from another point of view..This person is posting in this place because they need advice. This shows that their understanding of the subject may be incomplete, and they know this, which is why they're asking. 

What that means is that when the original poster adds in details like their surgical status, they aren't doing it because they define those people by the condition of their genitals. They're doing it because they don't know enough to decide whether or not it's relevant. 

Don't jump to be angered so easily. Anyone can make a mistake when they don't know enough about something to realise they're making it."	43q0q1	trans	12	0.78	2016-02-01 19:07:24

Told my mother two weeks ago tomorrow. She's lost, but has her heart in that right place. There's way more focus on me changing my name than anything else. She also told my aunt (with permission) so that's one less person for me to deal with. 

I texted and then spent time on the phone with my father today. He really only knows how to show love by buying things and he's already trying to so I count that as a win. He has a friend with a trans kid, so there's already some exposure.

Reddit! You are invited to participate in my survey concerning gender and sexual minorities and their experience with sexual education.	"You are invited to participate in a psychology study examining any relationship between sexual education and a person‚Äôs sexual attitudes, sexual satisfaction, and overall well-being. I believe that my study may be especially beneficial to the GSM (Gender and Sexual Minority) community. Participation in this study is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time without penalty. You must be at least 18 years old and a citizen of the United States to participate. The questions in this survey are personal and sexual in nature, but you may skip any question you do not wish to answer. If you complete the survey, you will be given a chance to enter a drawing to win a $25 Amazon gift card.  This survey is a part of my senior thesis project and I greatly appreciate your participation. Thank you for your time. 

The survey can be found at this link:

"	"I would recommend posting this in /r/asktransgender as it is much more populous.
Couple things.  First, your survey says it will pay people 50 cents but it doesn't actually at the end.  The other thing I wanted to comment on is that it doesn't ask you where you did get most of your sexual education from.  I had formal sex ed in school, which didn't teach me anything useful that I didn't already know, and was otherwise self-taught by reading things online and in books.  My positive attitude toward sexuality definitely did not come from any sex ed I received, but there's no way to communicate where it *did* come from in your survey.
Maybe you want United States residents rather than citizens? I'm a citizen by my dad's birth, but I've only been there once for a couple months on holiday.
Androgynous asexual person who is happily married, doesn't have sex much, and had pretty good sex ed.

*I'm coming for you, bell curve. Prepare for the _outlier._*
I feel like I could be skewing data, since:

1) I'm 31 and had sex ed classes in 1998-1999, which means I was taught in a different time

2) I identified as heterosexual cis male at the time I had this education, and am currently bisexual trans female, so some of the stuff I learned that applied *then* isn't as useful now, and I didn't learn a lot of things then that would have, at the time, been unhelpful, but now would be.

I still answered the study regardless.

Edit - also confirming I was not paid.  Not a huge deal, it's only 50 cents and I was only doing it for data anyway, but you shouldn't say you're going to pay people, and then not do so, IMO."	4cbuxg	trans	12	0.94	2016-03-28 19:58:39

Transgender Canadian woman sets off debate after winning cycling world championship		"I would imagine that after a few years of HRT, MtF womens' muscle mass shouldn't be proportionally much higher, if at all, than natal womens', since testosterone is the main driving factor in why men are generally stronger than women.

But there are other factors to consider, too, like lung capacity and circulatory system efficiency, that I'm not sure have been studied as much.

Lots of people have said that trans women tend to blow natal women out of the water in sports performance, but I can't verify or deny that without samples and numbers on hand.

I want to say that trans women should be treated as equal competitors to natal women, but I just can't feel certain in such a statement without data and more targeted studies.
I want to comment on it but quite honestly I have nothing smart to say. I am not a medical professional and I have no proper understanding of the topic. Best I can say is that those doctors better be super right in what they say about trans athletes otherwise we're eventually going to get a shitstorm our way. (Knowing people we're likely going to get it anyway, but if it happens it's best if doctors are on our side and have good evidence for what they say.)
I've seen a few people suggest that we start organizing sports by weight class instead of along gender lines and that seems like the best solution to this problem to me.
All the other subs discussing this depress me.  So many TERFs and transphobes.  They want us all dead.  
This was also posted on r/wtf and it pissed me off lol
I dont think there has been a study on this that would really answer these questions well enough. I am in the military and my run times got a lot slower...but probably not as slow as they would be if I had started HRT at like 14. This is a difficult issue for sure. Banning trans people from sports is dirty, but what if it really is unfair? 
I may be projecting a bit, but I *expect* that most people who are against this are like me totally okay with trans people existing and living normal lives as whichever gender they prefer. It's just that the *specific* case of sports is one where they may have a significant and unfair advantage over cis-women.
I find it unfair (just look at her size on the photo!) and think it is one of the few areas of life where trans people should not be treated 100% like their desired gender. Otherwise 1) it gives an incentive for some people to ""cheat"" and claim transgender status to get medals (admittedly somewhat unlikely), and more importantly 2) it risks making a lot of people dismissive of trans rights in general. Especially if more trans women start competing in sports competitions and this becomes common.

(disclaimer: I'm not trans, I came here because I was curious of what trans people thought of this)
Imagine your life revolves around a sport that you are professionally part of...and then you transistion and lose everything. I also see where you are coming from.
the IOC already did the research and disagrees with you.  

> I find it unfair (just look at her size on the photo!) and think it is one of the few areas of life where trans people should not be treated 100% like their desired gender.

well that's terrible of you.
It would probably be fair to allow a transwoman to keep competing in men's category (though whether she would accept to do so is another story). And if society has sufficiently clear rules around this, people should have sufficiently advance warning to not build their life around something that they will lose if they transition. It's not as if a career in sports was *that* common a choice...
Maybe, but what's the alternative ? A world where *all* top performers in the women's categories of certain sports are trans, so that cis women don't even have a chance ? I don't think many people will be happy with that.
Yeah I think this is a relatively small issue made to seem much larger by the fact that sports gets a lot of publicity.

nope.  
The alternative is to listen to professional athletics associations.  They all disagree with you.  But don‚Äôt let that stop you from making up a fake scenario to support your transphobia.  
Oh I'm fine the professional athletics associations having the last say on this issue. I suspect, however, that if similar cases become too frequent, those associations will change their regulations to keep the competition fair.

[The IOC Consensus Meeting document on that topic](https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2015-11_ioc_consensus_meeting_on_sex_reassignment_and_hyperandrogenism-en.pdf) (as they say, *""The overriding sporting objective is and remains the guarantee of fair competition. Restrictions on participation are appropriate to the extent that they are necessary and proportionate to the achievement of that objective.""*, and *""These guidelines are a living document and will be subject to review in light of any scientific or medical developments.""*)."	9oiztz	trans	13	0.77	2018-10-16 01:28:34

It‚Äôs Going to Be Okay, No Matter the Results	" 

Firstly, I want to clarify that this isn‚Äôt saying that it‚Äôs not okay to be angry if Trump wins. You have every right to be furious. Scream, cry, do what you need to to get it all out. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that it‚Äôs immature or dramatic. These are our lives on the line. Anyone can dismiss our concerns as unfounded, but, as painful as is it is to admit, for many of us that‚Äôs simply not true.

This has been on my mind watching and waiting for the election results to come in. I‚Äôm exhausted at the prospect of another four years of this man. But I‚Äôm also secure in the terrifying prospect that we will be okay anyway. This community, these people, our very identities are not going anywhere. We will fight the same way we do day in and day out. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs with kind words to those in our community who need us or through throwing bricks and starting riots. We fight just the same. 

I say this to every person sitting in front of a TV or computer feeling fear creep in, it‚Äôs going to be okay. I know it‚Äôs a trope, and I don‚Äôt give a damn. I love you. I love this community. I am proud to be a part of this community. I‚Äôm afraid of what comes next, but I will stand in solidarity with every single one of you. I may be shaking, crying, and want nothing more than to run from the reality of being trans in this country right now. But I will stand next to you. I might not be able to do it for myself, but I will for you.

Someday we will be accepted again. Someday trans children will look in a history book and see our struggles as a far off reality they can barely imagine for the rights and acceptance they have had since day one. It may never be in our lifetime. It may be 10000 years from now. But as long as we keep fighting, it will come.

This man cannot stop us. We have been through hate, violence, and a never ending battle to simply be allowed existence. One person will not stop our community, any more than any other attempt to suppress us throughout history has. He can beat us down. We will not stop.

I know this is probably meaningless, but I just had to get everything I was thinking and feeling tonight out. I love you all so much, and I know that one way or another it‚Äôs going to be okay"	"Thanks for this little bit of calming positivity!

AMA Completely Stealth for the Past 5 Years~ the Maybe Good the Bad and the Ugly	"Hey everyone,

I transitioned about 7 years ago, when I was 19 and I have been fully stealth for about 5 years. What I mean by that is that apart from my family, my romantic/sexual partners and one friend, nobody in my day to day life knows about me being trans. It is also a subject I rarely talk about even with those people that know about it. And to be honest it has it‚Äôs good and bad sides.

After all those years away from the trans community and with everything that has been happening in the world in the last year, I felt like I wanted to reconnect with the community and also have a place where I can open up and share/exchange about the experience of being stealth and hopefully help people in the process. Because honestly it can kind of get lonely from time to time and I am sure that other stealth people can relate. When I transitioned my dream was to live a life where I fully pass and I actually thought I might not be able to do so or that I might need surgery like FFS before reaching that point. However, I feel extremely fortunate that I was able to live that life after only 2 years into my transition. 

For me I transitioned because I wanted people to see me as the woman I felt like, and my biggest fear when telling either my one close friend that knows about me being trans, or dates, is that they would stop seeing me as a woman. I do also feel a bit dishonest, having to constantly rewrite my past so that I can still talk about it without having to out myself to my friends. If anyone can relate, you are not alone. And the truth is, even writing this message on a reddit account that has no link to who I am IRL feels like a big moment of coming out for me. But it is so weird, it shouldn‚Äôt feel that way. I came out 7 years ago and I‚Äôm still quite stressed about posting this message‚Ä¶

Being stealth also comes with a lot of good things like not even having to worry about... You know what all the positive things I can think of right now are things that happens when you pass, but not necessary when you are stealth. Oh, there's the fact that people see and treat me as a woman which has it's good and bad sides at the same time. Honestly I'll have to really think about that one, it's kind of weird that before writing this post that had never occurred to me: I am really having a hard time to find good things about being stealth that passing doesn't already solve... Apart from being sure that my friends actually see me as a woman and don't just ""act"" as if I am one and maybe less discrimination in certain context. Maybe this should go in another post but if anyone can think of positives of being fully stealth that passing doesn't already give you feel free to mention it!

Anyway, if anyone has any questions about anything I‚Äôll do my best to answer them, although since right now I do not feel like outing myself completely to the world, I may leave out certain details when answering questions.

Cheers! (\*\^‚Äø\^\*)  


By the way, I have literally no idea how reddit works(I literally just created my first account), if it‚Äôs the right place to post something like that and if it‚Äôs actually something that might help/interest some people, but if I can just help or answer the question of at least one person, it will be a win for me!"	"Thank you for sharing this I am 6 months in I absolutely do not pass and don‚Äôt necessarily strive for it although I‚Äôm sure it will happen but I think your post really just hits home with the being lonely I have no community I have a couple acquaintances that are spread out a bit from where I am and everyone is always got something going on that‚Äôs life but to not have someone tangible to connect with is hard and I can‚Äôt really imagine that being stealth or passing would cure that either as for not outing yourself by default and the friends you make probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to relate anyway as it is unlikely not impossible but unlikely that two stealth become friends not knowing lol for me your loneliness is my loneliness There is only so much we can accomplish by text I wish you the best and if you ever want to chat or vent my DM is always open and thank you again ‚ù§Ô∏è
How you handled your friend cycle in early transition or befor you passed
> it is unlikely not impossible but unlikely that two stealth become friends not knowing lol

  
I'm glad this post seems to have made you feel better!

I was thinking about that writing this post actually ""it is unlikely not impossible but unlikely that two stealth become friends not knowing lol"".  
and it is kind of why I wrote that post, Just trying to see if anyone was in the same boat of if anyone was curious about my experience being stealth.   


Just to add a bit on what I wrote. Even though I am not sure anymore if I still want to stay stealth, because of the points mentioned above, I do feel like I really enjoyed the time I got to be, I guess to add to the positive of being stealth, for me: not really having to think about trans issue and talk about it was a weight less on my shoulders. Now, I'm wondering, since I'm much more confident than I used to be, if that positive is worth the negatives, especially with closer friends.
Great question! I was in college and back then I already was not so much in contact with high school friends. The hischool friends I were in contact with, I simply ended up not seeing or talking to them anymore. As for Facebook and things like that I deleted everything and created new ones. Now for the college friends, it really helped that I changed career and went to a new school. Right now, I still have my college friends that knows about by transition, on social media, but since I do not interact with them and that group of friend is not linked in anyway to my professional life or currents friends I talked to, I just keep it that way and am not scared about being outed, although it could happen, it just never did. And to go back to your question I was really fortunate that all my college friends and teachers were super accepting some even really supporting, I was in an art field and I guess a lot of artist are quite open minded.   


As for passing, I do think I started passing 90% of the time quite early on. The thing is, through my transition and coming out, I wanted to make it a point that it was not a big deal to present as the other gender, by acting as if it was not a big deal. What I did is a year before I let my hair grow did started laser, voice training, eventually hormone, etc., without telling anyone except my mother. My coming out for school was literally me going to college in full fem, after summer vacation, having only told 1 person about it and being like: ""Hey I'm Liliya!"". At first some people were clearly shocked, one thought it was a joke, some were extremely nice and I remember a friend of mine was dead serious telling me ""Hey you have a brother going to this school, right? I know him!"" and making conversation about that. In the end all those people were quite amazing and accepting and those that were not, kept it for themselves. I also chose to transition that way because I wanted to make it as easy as possible for people around me and new people I meet to get the right gender and name. I do think that was mostly a success!
Yeah it‚Äôs one thing to just have to deal with it and another to be able to choose and make it a point to deal with it and it‚Äôs better now then 7 years ago but it still has its moments to to bring that upon yourself knowing that you will get triggered as opposed to being a stealth super allie there to rescue your siblings without repercussions is also a tremendous feat only you can decide

Mom didn‚Äôt reject me, said she still loves me, just doesn‚Äôt agree	Agree with what? Gender dysphoria existing? The treatment? Don‚Äôt care. This is still a win in my book. Even if a small one.	"Agreed. There are too many trans getting kicked out on the streets at a young age. Even if she is unsupportive, at least you have the safety of a roof for a while longer.
Sorry to be disillusionly now, but saying she loves you, but rejecting who you really are, is not love. She loves a picture that is in here mind, she is not loving you.
I would agree. We can long for a perfect world where nobody disagrees with the facts, but the reality is that sometimes that's not an option. I would say that she probably does love you, and the reason that she doesn't agree is because she's misinformed. Parents want what's best for their kids, but nobody is perfect, and sometimes parents don't understand what *is* best. She can at least see that rejecting you and treating you badly is the wrong way to go, which might just be a basis for her to change her mind over the next lifetime! :) You'd be surprised by just how many people are okay with transitioning, even if they don't agree with it. My brother is the same way. He doesn't agree with any of it, but he's totally cool about it all and doesn't act like a dick when it comes up. (I even went to a concert with him in full makeup!) You're mom might come around one day, but don't reject *her* just because she's imperfect. (Do reject her if it starts getting bad, though. If she starts trying to stop you, or starts harassing you for it, then pull the plug. But until then, let's hope for the best.)
I agree with this.
Took me a year and a half to finally realize this. We don't speak now.
I agree with you, but from a pragmatic perspective, it's still better than being completely rejected or forced to endure anything serious or kicked out of the house all together. 

OP should look out for red flags.

Finally Some Positive Trans Representation in My Country	"Hello everyone!
A friend of mine made this really sweet movie about 3 elderly LGBT couples. One of the couples the film portrays is a lesbian relationship between a transwoman and a ciswoman. The film is currently in a competition (popular vote, who gets more likes) and if it wins its going to be shown countrywide through one of the public TV stations (Canal Futura). I really hope it does because in Brazil we barely have any positive trans representation (especially in a lesbian relationship, especially an elder couple) and continues to be the country with (TW !) the largest number of transpeople killed. So it would be a really big step for us to have this circulating countrywide.

Just thought I'd share this experience	"So I (ftm) know a lot of Trans people have had very bad experiences with hospitals and a lot of fear around hospitals so I just thought I'd share my experience of the past few weeks. I understand that as an Ftm person I won't have to experience *nearly* as much discrimination and Hate as a mtf or non-bianary person, but I thought I should still share anyway.

I started volunteering over the past few weeks at this hospital. The woman interviewing me looked maybe late 20's early 30's, so I assumed it was safe to come out (which it was) I'm not on any testosterone and I'm pretty chesty so it's hard to pass. A lot of the volunteers are either in Highschool, college or older retired people who got bored.  

They were *super* respectful and accommodating!! Changing my name in their system, putting my preferred name on my badge, catching and correcting slip-ups, and overall just making it a great environment. 

Even the doctors, nurses and other staff who saw my name badge always used that name and my preferred Pronouns. 

Since I'm in training, I had to work with most of the older trainers who had been there longer, so I knew slip ups were gonna happen and expected some resistance. 

... and yet found none?? 

Even they were super nice and always corrected their slip ups! When another trans guy (patient) said he was going to the women's health clinic the conversation with my like 75ish year old trainer went as follows

Trainer: ""Those wards don't allow visitors at the moment""

Transguy (quietly): no, it's my appointment.

Trainer: ok yeah that's fine, 2nd floor just no visitors"" 


Hospitals treat all kinds of patients and I know care providers don't always know *the science*  behind trans people, but I do know that (at least this particular hospital) will at least try. 

 ..... and then a patient called me ma'am in the parking lot today, but... you win some you lose some bois"	"I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôve had a good experience! We need more trans people in healthcare, lol.
FTM ppl do not face less discrimination. You just hear about it less bc FTM people are forced under the radar; patriarchy can't tolerate AFAB people not being women and thusly silences us, taking us less seriously and minimizing the harm we have experienced. Please stop with the ""MTFs have it worse"" thing bc they don't. Trans people as a whole are affected by transphobia, not one gender group worse than the other."	w5pgtq	trans	13	0.85	2022-07-23 00:03:19
Does Kim Petras claiming to be the first trans woman to win a Grammy bother you?	Given Wendy Carlos won 3 Grammys in 1968‚Ä¶ like either that‚Äôs major pick me energy or somehow she doesn‚Äôt know who Wendy Carlos is despite also being a prominent trans musician.  It‚Äôs sad watching the headlines read she‚Äôs the first trans woman to win, erasing Wendy Carlos‚Äô success 65 years ago.	"So it does seem like Wendy Carlos didn't reveal that she was transgender until 1979, 10 years after winning the Grammys. So unless there's someone else, it would be more appropriate to say that Kim Petra's is the first openly transgender woman to win a Grammy?
I'd say she's the first to openly win it. There's a big difference between winning while closeted and winning while openly being a trans woman.

I am glad this is getting more people to pay attention to Wendy Carlos, she deserves to be remembered.
If nothing else, I'm very glad to know who Wendy Carlos is now. So maybe this moment can be used to help educate people on Trans history. Especially since so many people think this was something invented in the last 20 years. 

Possibly just ignorance on Petras' part though. Iirc, Sam Smith also claimed to be the first openly gay person to win an Oscar for music too, which was just factually incorrect.
Didn't Kim credit Wendy in her speech?
I don‚Äôt think people were doing it on purpose. A lot of us, even queer and trans folk, didn‚Äôt know about Wendy Carlos. This is why we need to collectively ‚Äúwrite‚Äù our own history and spread the word! Because we can‚Äôt expect other people to take notice. And when they do, they just find caricature trans people to interview to fit their narrative. 
Let this also be a teaching lesson (to those cis people willing to listen): we have ALWAYS been here. It‚Äôs not a fad, it‚Äôs not a phase, it‚Äôs not a political statement. The only reason you‚Äôre noticing more trans publicity is because‚Ä¶we‚Äôre tired of hiding and wearing masks all the damn time. And people, like Wendy and Kim, are kicking down doors for us, and breaking glass ceilings, so we can continue to live our best lives. I don‚Äôt know who the next trans artist to win a Grammy will be. But I hope the world continues to be more accepting and supportive. Because like it or not, we‚Äôre not going anywhere, least of all back in the closet.
Kim Petras didn't say she's the first transgender woman at all. She said she's the first winning pop duo/group, which is true.
I‚Äôve never heard of Wendy Carlos but I have now so thank you ! ‚ù§Ô∏è I think any trans broadcasting that they are trans is a good thing. Saying they are first doesn‚Äôt matter, I think , to me anyway because We have to be our own publicists as trans people. The more trans in the spotlight the better and we should support each other,  especially now. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Coincidentally, I was just watching Tron last night, and thinking I liked the music. Turns out the score is by Wendy Carlos.
I think it‚Äôs important to say this is the first time the Grammy‚Äôs knowingly awarded a trans person.  That‚Äôs the milestone, the acceptance in that act.
That's true, it's definitely great representation for us.  I genuinely didn't know Kim Petras was trans until last year despite following her since her SOPHIE collabs, but I guess that's goals for a lot of people to be fair.
It's funny because I knew about Wendy Carlos (as a music producer how could I not??), but I literally didn't know Kim Petras was trans until last year even though I followed her since her SOPHIE collabs.  I have a feeling a lot of people are just now finding out that Kim Petras is trans (which honestly would be goals if I wasn't so belligerently outspoken on my platform), but the representation is obviously amazing for us.
This!!!
And The Shining and Clockwork Orange!
Ok, that makes sense.  It made me feel a little weird yesterday, but after seeing these comments I get that the significance is different.  Looking back on it from the present somewhat takes away that perspective I guess."	10w7xfe	trans	13	0.78	2023-02-07 17:40:51
A little reminder for those who are scared that victory is inevitable	"Trans people have always existed and will continue to exist, we are not a political ideology or religion that can be defeated and forgotten, no matter what, we will always be around.

Transphobes are only capable of delaying our progress, but are incapable of defeating us as a whole, and with today's technology, more and more people discover themselves and find out that they can be who they were always meant to be, they learn new things and thus, we grow in number!

Whenever you see anti-trans propaganda, keep in mind that it wouldn't need to exist if we were losing the battle, we are winning, one day we will be free, the reactionaries are having their final stand against us, they may try to take away our rights but they will never take away our spirit!

Thank you all for helping me combat my pessimism and fear, without you all, I'm not sure I'd even think of victory for our cause and our future, much love to all my trans brothers, sisters and siblings out there! <3"	"Remember this, boys and girls: if they are cursing or shouting at you, you are doing something right.

weapons. I feel the need to carry one does anyone have any advice?	"It doesn't have to be a firearm, just something I can protect myself with. 

My state allows concealed carry with no permit. But I'm really thinking a Balisong knife. 

Has anyone survived an attack where fighting was the only option? I've been In fights before, even an armed conflict in which I was bludgeoned pretty hard but I lost. 

I want to be able to win (as in maim and escape).

Also I need to consider the logistics of a weapon in women's pants that have no functional pockets. 

Any input?"	"From my experience, you don't need to have a useable weapon, just a threat of a weapon. I used to carry around a magician cane. I had one incident where someone was following me.popped it open and he just turned on his heel. If open carry is allowed..I'll be honest Walmart sells toy guns that can be mistaken for real with a coat of black paint. (It was believable enough the cops were called on me lol)
Maybe pepper spray?
You're more likely to accidentally drop a knife than use it effectively, that's just reality. The other situation is the attacker takes it from you, then you're fucked. Unless you know how to use a knife and know what it feels like to stab someone, can't say I'd recommend it. If you do stab someone it will leave you mentally scarred. Can't recommend that either.

Something that seems to work... carry around a hypo and if someone gets aggressive, let them see you uncap it. The threat of bloodborne pathogen should be enough to make them think twice about getting close to you. This however, is also a crime basically like flashing a knife.
In a fight where one person has a knife and the other person is unarmed,  both people are at risk of serious harm, since actual knife fighting takes a lot of skill and hurting yourself with it even slightly can handicap you for life if you're not careful. It also allows the aggressor to get close. A long range weapon (gun, taser, pepper/bear spray) will always be better for self defence
And why a balisong, for the style points? Something like an out the front blade would look more threatening. But don't cheap out on one, cheap ones break down easily. Pepper spray works too tho. Fucks them up for life as well.
Get those jewelry things that have secret knives in them one sec I‚Äôll see if I can find a link to a store
No one wins a knife fight. Never pull a gun unless you intend to use it and you cannot very well use a fake one right?... Get some mace and a taser.
I feel that whatever you end up getting, you should train to a point of high proficiency. Because you don‚Äôt want to be learning how to use a weapon when you‚Äôre in the middle of a fight. Especially a life threatening fight. 

I have a collapsible baton. I grew up sword fighting with sticks. We were kind of obsessed with it. I could seriously f someone up with a 3‚Äô metal rod. Seeing someone expand a baton is intimidating to watch. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to use it on anyone dumb enough to keep coming after seeing that. 

PS I would recommend checking with local laws to ensure that whatever you do isn‚Äôt illegal. Cuz that would be horrible for you.
I don't know if a balisong will work well in a life or death situation, though they have presumably been used in some type of combat, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I bought some pepper spray and I carry a 7-inch knife in my car (definitely too big for its current purpose). Your best bet would be some type of concealable handgun. Nothing stops people faster than a gun. But you need to practice your draw, shooting, etc. Situational awareness is also key. Go reaching too soon and you end up hurt, reach too late and it's more of the same. The do have holsters that can go just about anywhere they'll fit. 

All that being said any weapon will have its pros and cons. Knives require you to be up close and personal.  Guns require great reaction timing if you are being charged by someone (something like 20 feet and you're pretty useless against someone charging at you). It's probably best to keep a mix, and if needed, use each accordingly.
Idc what anyone thinks or says, I never leave home with packing. Never know.
Gun, don‚Äôt even gotta be loaded
I don‚Äôt know what shoes you wear but maybe a boot knife might be an option?
Pepper spray, it‚Äôs very effective in most situations, you can‚Äôt kill someone with it, it‚Äôs never considered reason for lethal force (like if a cop sees you with it, they can‚Äôt say they fear for their life) and if you accidentally use it due to a misunderstanding the worst you can get is a fine
Maybe reach out to Pink Pistols or r/SocialistRA, if there are chapters of either in your area, or even Armed Equality. Although they typically focus on firearms skills, I‚Äôm sure they can work with you to find suitable alternatives.
I carry a sig p250 9mm with an extra mag or rarely my 357mag revolver. I use a carry purse, kydex appendix holster, or my urban carry concealment holster when I'm working or depending on situation. I also carry a first aid kit (shears, hemostatics, tourniquets, chest seals, etc) and my fire dept go bag is in my trunk too. Probs beyond what's needed but I'd like to be prepared to defend myself and patch myself up from an attack well enough to make the hospital.
I CCW a full size 1911 chambered in 45. Loaded with hollow points. It is a level of safety. The story I got this is very long. But my fianc√© feels better knowing im working late nights with protection. I mostly use a belly band. Or if im wearing woman‚Äôs tactical pants will I have a holster. I do not recommend this gun for other women. I recommend a small glock or sig. preferably 9mm. Easier to wear around the waist in womans jeans. 

Hope this helps
It‚Äôs a really bad idea to feint having a gun. It might be useful in some cases, but if you‚Äôre pulling a gun, it‚Äôs with the intention to defend your life, if need be, at the expense of theirs. You do not want to be in a situation where someone calls that bluff and you can‚Äôt defend yourself
Best way to alleviate this is just to practice taking out your knife quickly, holding it, stabbing cardboard boxes, just getting used to what it feels like so you don't drop it and being able to take it out without thinking about it in a stressful situation. Mental scars are better than getting the shit beat out of you, or getting killed.
I've stabbed a man before. I didn't loose much sleep. He had me cornered. He was asking for it.
The balisong is for quick draw and balance. The only knife illegal here is an actual stilleto switch blade.
Example: https://www.karatemart.com/hidden-blade-bullet-necklace
I won a knife fight. Yeah I needed 8 staples but I lived. The trick is just like you said don't pull it till your killing the threat.
Yes they do. Bluffing gets you killed
Will it stop someone on meth?
[deleted]
That's a really bad idea. I do too much sketchy shit to have a fake gun on me when someone starts Wiggin out
I can tell if Neither of you have been in a knife fight because only losers stabbed in a knife fight. A stab wound requires 5 stitches  slash wound might need 400
Then my knife advice doesnt apply to you, keep up the good work
I mean sure you lived. But all things considered if you could have ended it with a taser and fleeing with no staples. Would you have preferred that outcome and considered that more of a win?
I have a friend currently thinking of using a revolver. But dont those only have 6 shots? I think a Glock 19 gets 10 rounds.

"Build community. Find solidarity. Seek joy wherever you can get it. We do our best and keep living. That‚Äôs all we can do.
Look really into it. Things are getting much better in recent years.  
First time I wanted to transition my country wanted me sterilized and celibate. There were so many more roadblocks. In the 90s you only ever saw trans people as a ‚Äûjoke‚Äú (think ace ventura) or as crazy murderers in movies.  

Now cis people *openly & visibly support us* on social media. We get positive depiction in media. We‚Äòre getting more rights and better healthcare each year, despite many attempts to turn back the clock.  
We can connect with each other, we can help each other.   

It‚Äòs getting better, let‚Äòs not give up until it‚Äòs better for all of us everywhere.

Don‚Äôt despair. Just in my adult lifetime, we‚Äôve gone from the only gender non-conformity talked about was shamed and talked about mockingly in public discourse to having advanced vocabulary and understanding of so many variations in gender expression. That the public discourse, while often hateful and always stressful, is happening at all is an amazing shift in the culture. This moment is our opportunity to attack all the systems of oppression, and I believe in the future. Eventually love and good will triumph, and with the pace of change, eventually will be soon, like, years or months! These fights have been brewing for generations, and your generation may well be the ones who finally break us all free. If your own oppression is feeling particularly heavy, I encourage you to engage systems that you have privilege in to help destabilize hate where it isn‚Äôt aimed directly at you. 

It seems really scary right now, but this is such an important and amazing time to be alive!
thats not an option, and even if i did, trans people all around the world will still suffer.
Oh i see what you mean, as a community, not just you, well here ill send you something an old post/comment i pade here on R/ trans
*i got a lil off track a bit but its good i think*

So me, im a cis man, who is gay, and seen or being called, the straightest gay man ever, doesnt feel tall that bad because it makes me think ""well if no body can tell im gay what if people like me are apart of gays becoming normalized and not seen as freaks, now heres where trans people come into play, i have 3 friends all trans, one is kai FtM, my boyfriend, second one is Aether FtM, lastly is Jaymi AFAB enby, now me all I want is better for the future, and i as a young adult watch people around the world blow up get rich and make changes just by saying a few words after a few years of hard work, my thought process is if trash human being can talk to me like a normal person and look me eye to eye and listen (witch has happened multiple times now) i can make some change, so i would go on a texas or florida podcast and talk about subject people are uncomfortable with and also when me and my friends are bug enough and have enough money we want to make huge donations to the trevor project, have huge giveaways of hella binders, and binding tape, and like once a year we pay for someones top surgery, i have big dreams for a dark place, and we will address everything from pedos(MAPs) to trans rights to poly relations and this isnt just me who wants this may friends i mentioned want this too, aether out of them all the most, he wants to see all of this leave because he is a victim, his father is an asshole who wants to see eye to eye but cant fix himself to do it, he isnt that bad but he can be terrible and the worst, again, i just wanna sit, talk, and see eye to eye, and help open up peoples minds, help change, and help prevent suicides, or even drop the suicide rate all together i know this has been a rant but all we want is for us to be well, normal?

I stand with you all.	"I want to make one thing clear, although it may not sometimes feel like it, you do not stand alone. There are many people, just like me, who aren't transgender, who unapologetically, outspokenly support your right to live a dignified life, with complete and full protection under the law, and in daily life. 

I believe that one of the most fundamentally important aspects of a democracy is the preservation and protection of the civil rights of the most vulnerable groups and minorities. These days, transgender people face a completely unprovoked and unprecedented assualt on their existence. Why its happening ultimately makes no difference. We must defeat this assault on transgender folks and other minority groups. When I say ""we"" i mean all Americans who believe in freedom and democracy. We must stand united against this assault on our brothers and sisters. It pains me to sometimes see the counterproductive fractalism that plagues left leaning groups and communities, and it pains me even more to see the authoritarians and fascists winning by alienating and demonizing the most vulnerable people in society. Transgender people, immigrants, minorities, and so on and so forth. They will try to turn us against one another. They will try to use any difference to divide us.

 But, ultimately, it will never succeed. I, like you, know that your life has meaning and value. You are a beautiful and special person with a lot to contribite to this world. You are strong as an individual  and we are unstoppable when we stand together. You ask me what my identity is? I identify as your ally. That is enough. Women wouldn't have achieved equal civil right without men. Blacks wouldnt have achieved civil rights without whites. This is not to hijack or in anyway minimize how hard women and blacks fought and died for their civil rights. Its to highlight the fact that, civil rights have been achieved through standing united, not isolation. 

I am saying these words to everyone and anyone who may have ever felt alienated. You are not alone. You are with me, and i am with you, and we are with the rest of everyone. Power isnt something you get and keep in your cupboard for a rainy day. It must be fought for constantly. It must be safeguarded and protected. Its a neverending struggle, but it gives our lives meaning and value. Please always remember this. And always remember that, despite the loudest voices seeming they are against you, the forces of nature, god, and the universe are with you, and so am I!

Im not saying this for approval or a pat on the head. Im saying this because we must realize our strength when we are united. We are constantly made to feel like we are in the back foot in this fight, but that isnt the case. There are ups and downs, triumphs and defeats, but if we have the resolve to endure, we shall overcome the forces of evil that seek to destory us. 

Do something once a day to boost your self confidence, and reach out to an ally to let them know, I STAND WITH YOU!

Levi‚Äôs has are the best pants!!	"On their women‚Äôs jeans, they have the sizes of their pants in both Men‚Äôs and Women‚Äôs sizes. I just bought a pair of black jeans that are a woman‚Äôs size 16, or a men‚Äôs 33x32, and it made it so incredibly easy just buying a pair of pants without worrying if they will fit or not.

I‚Äôm also 6 feet tall (with pretty long legs), so whenever I do buy/try on women‚Äôs pants, they are usually too short on me. It drives me nuts. Most of the other pants had around 26 to 29 inch legs, and it all just makes so much sense now.

I thought I would get used to it or take my transition for granted--I haven't.	"I've always been afraid of good things becoming the new normal. Heard too many stories of people winning the lottery or having some amazing life changing experience that makes them the happiest person alive, and then years later they just get used to their new life and no longer are grateful--its no longer something special.

When I started transitioned socially, cut my hair and started dressing masculine, presenting that way was such a joyous experience and I just couldn't get enough of it. Years later, I transitioned medically, and realizing all the little ways that my body and face were changing filled with so much euphoria that it was almost overwhelming. I've now been out as trans for five years, pass 100% of the time, and have had top surgery. At this point in my transition I would have expected the way I look and feel now to become the new normal, but *every single time* I look in the mirror I feel this rush of happiness, a warm feeling that fills me up and always causes me to pause and reflect on how grateful I am. Getting dressed in the morning makes me smile, getting called sir by strangers makes me euphoric, and not even because it's new or rare--I've been passing consistently for YEARS. I get gendered correctly by people every single day. And yet just existing as myself is such a large source of joy for me and I genuinely hope this feeling never goes away"	"Congratulations, man!

Historic win! Trans woman wins claim against employer using Civil Rights Act of 1964			1ieheb	trans	11	0.91	2013-07-16 08:51:14
I just learned that the person who was a hypermasculine homophobic asshole to me through my teens, and who ultimately ostracized me from my friendgroup due to my queerness, is now a trans woman	"I feel so fucking awful.

This person got to pretend to be a straight boy when it served her best in her teens and twenties, whereas I've always been visibly effeminate and was outed as bisexual against my will at age 14. I never got a chance to be ""one of the guys."" And this person got to shit on me for it the whole time. She got to make it through college with a support system while I dropped out due to mental illness. She got to win over our shared friendgroup while I was lonely through most of my twenties. And now that she's involved in the weird music scene (as I have been for a long time), she gets to grow out her hair and put on a dress and be one of us trans women.

It's not fair that I had to experience the brunt of the trauma of visible queerness for most of my life while this person got to easily slip into whatever role served her best at the time. And it's not like I have receipts for any of her actions against me; she will never have to face the consequences of what she did to me, and now she gets to be part of the community that I for the longest time felt was the most important thing I had against her.

I feel like I have nothing."	"Don‚Äòt let that bully into your thoughts like that OP. She doesn‚Äòt deserve it.   
The best way to overcome old bullies is to ignore them and focus on your own life.  
Your place is still in the community. She cannot take that away from you.
I was something like this person in high school and if it helps, she was profoundly miserable underneath it all and she's probably really ashamed of the way she treated you
>This person *got to* pretend to be a straight boy when it served her best  
  
So her behavior before was definitely unacceptable and I don't intend to make excuses for her but surely we can all agree that girls being forced to pretend they're straight boys because of cisheteronormativity is **not** a privilege but a different kind of suffering.
As someone who's also not always been a good person in their teens: the hypermasculine fuckboy type I was for a few years before my egg cracked was an empty shell of a person, and not a representation of who I am. It was a performance of masculinity because I didn't know better. That doesn't undo any harm caused, but people can grow, and their trans journey will not be easier just because they acted a certain way before coming out. You don't have to forgive this person, but that doesn't mean they aren't just as much a trans woman as you. I hope you can find a support group of friends, you deserve it <3
Maybe you haven‚Äôt realized this yet but in general when someone bullies you it‚Äôs because they are miserable and insecure and when someone is a homophobe it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre a closet queer. 

Also, some people aren‚Äôt as self aware as you. They might not understand what is going on inside them and that can cause all sorts of unpleasant behaviors to manifest. 

Although you have every right to resent this persons awful behavior, harboring resentment serves no purpose. 

Continue to be the best person you can be and forget about people who aren‚Äôt good for your mental health. I know that‚Äôs easier said than done but in time, you won‚Äôt even remember who this person is. Onward and upward‚Ä¶.
Come on. You can't seriously think it was easy for her to pretend to be a straight man the whole time. You can't seriously think she didn't struggle, just because she couldn't show it.

What she did to you is of course unjustifiable. *And* her life wasn't easy either.
I second this. I was a total bigot to a transman back then, thinking cmon your not a ""real"" man, your not oppressed, every has a rough life and its normal to struggle with that kind of stuff.... and here I am now..

I had a semi-nice dream	"I was driving home from work, and then when I got home I looked in my bathroom mirror and I had long beautiful hair, and my facial hair was gone. I was really happy and it felt real (except my back was disgustingly hairy, guess you can‚Äôt win with everything)

I miss my hair :("	"It happened to me often at the beginning of my transition. The first time I remember I was in a bar‚Äôs bathroom, and when I went back to my friend all excited because I was a woman he was playing cards with a mule. It was both extremely euphoric and dysphoric at the same time because then I woke up in my horrible horrible body. But the more time passes the more that picture in my dreams becomes real, and now I‚Äôm always her in my dreams. I still get the euphoria, but not quite as much dysphoria. She does have a nicer nose than me.
I started having dreams where she was in the background silenced when at first I tried fighting it, then sometimes she'd come up to me and speak. After a while I got comfortable with help from my wonderful fiancee and dealt with family issues she'd come up to me and speak and say nice things to me. Eventually with no transition I dream alot AS her. It's as one person said it's comforting until you're ripped out of it."	qmj1ck	trans	10	1.0	2021-11-04 12:02:43
Thoughts of remorse - not regret.	"I have been struggling immensely this evening. Before transitioning I was a successful, well renowned and notable and up and coming scientist. I was considered to be one of the top 5 in the U.S. - top 130 in the world and now I have nothing to do with that name. 

You used to be able to google me and get some pretty impressive results but, now? Now all I return is my current job and a background piece. I‚Äôve had award winning articles written about me and now‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôve deactivated all social media and I only return incredibly n√©gligeable nothingness. 

I wonder in times like this if it was worth it and it was but I‚Äôm still disappointed in myself. I wonder if I could have tougher thorough. Clearly not. 

What might y‚Äôall think. Would y‚Äôall have any advice?"	"I don‚Äôt understand, why can‚Äôt you be who you are and continue to be a brilliant scientist? You have an opportunity for viability and leadership, for inspiration to so many people who are struggling. You certainly don‚Äôt have to. Life is hard enough as it is!! But this might be an opportunity. You have been so brave and strong so far, perhaps you have room for more? Give yourself space and lots of love, there is no easy path but remember being a kid and being so scared and confused. You are valid and deserve all the fruits of your labor.
This may hit you or others as a trigger but honestly it‚Äôs still you, you don‚Äôt have to throw away your past. No matter how much trouble or trauma there was. You were still top 5 and you still can be. You‚Äôre just a different element now! (Science humor?) if you choose to throw away your notoriety then so be it but I say embrace it. Yeah that was me.. that was that nerdy kid in high-school..that was me that solved the unsolvable‚Ä¶ that can still be you that solves time travel in the near or not so near future depending on where you observe it from.  Though you may change forms that doesn‚Äôt mean the person you were all those yesterdays or minutes ago wasn‚Äôt you. This is simply your evolution into someone new.  If you‚Äôre a biblical believer there‚Äôs lots of representations about shedding your past from sin. To shed it and become anew. However as a caterpillar created the cocoon the butterfly destroys it and spreads its wings.
so....did you loose the ability to do great things because you transitioned? i dont think so. youre still good at what youre doing, you will archieve things like that again.
Is there any reason you can‚Äôt you be a world leading scientist and trans? Sounds to me like you have the potential to be a symbol of hope for trans people everywhere. Yeah sure there would most certainly be some pushback from certain groups, but there would also be plenty of  supporters as well. Probably even more so than the haters.
My two cents, don't throw away your past, wear it proud, it's part of who you are. Identity is not about gender only, also everything you hold dear. All your achievements are like your children, you don't disown them when you decide when you to move house. Embrace your past and move on to do even greater things.
You‚Äôre still the same person that accomplished all of those things. If you go on an interview for a job you can still say all of those things were you. You don‚Äôt have to throw away everything associated with your old name if you don‚Äôt want to.
I don't have advice, just a word or two from me misunderstanding your question :-).

I have had a career in engineering that nobody can really believe - especially me! The range and complexity of the things I worked on over a relatively short time make me sound like an old salt...its just from taking on some things nobody else would, and starting very young.

I eventually realized I was spending so much time and effort on these things because I was running away from myself, distracting myself as much as possible. Failing to set boundaries. Failing to demand what I needed, and bending myself backwards to 'get to play'. I derived my sense of worth from my work, and it was so easy to justify so much to try and fill that hole in myself.

The remorse I feel sometimes is for having so easily given up most of my youth to that, in service to fear and a lack of self-esteem. I love that I got to do all these things, yet that wasn't the feeling I had as I did them, and it very nearly killed me.

Don't get me wrong. I still love so much of what I do, and if I couldn't do this, it would be a very hard time. But since this realization, I got FAR more selective on what I wanted or didn't want and WHY. In the end, I relish the energy of collaborating with others, especially those with complete different backgrounds, respecting each other and loving what they could bring and do, and 'playing jazz' - finding the way to solve the problem with our unique set of skills. And, solving problems worth the time (as much as any of us can know). I hope I get to do this for a very long time...

I'd guess as a scientist, you're driven to observe and understand, asking 'why is it so', in communion with Nature. Do you still get to do this? Do you get that thrill of findings things out? I wonder what its like to be the first to see something in all of Existence like that. I dunno, I can't think that accolades hold a candle to that for very long - though, the former makes funding easier, I suspect.

Hope that was useful to you."	11irkw1	trans	9	0.92	2023-03-05 08:12:32

Which country is better for trans people?	"I live in a very blue state (NJ) but some of the shit I've been seeing lately here is horrific. I'm grateful I'm in NJ and not a republican state but the thing is that if a republican wins, especially someone like DeSantis, our blue state protections won't be there to save us anymore.

At this point I don't feel like I'm being overdramatic at all. They literally want to kill us. I also feel that the US is on the verge of collapsing as well and it'll probably get worse during the election. 

I feel like we're watching a ticking time bomb right now and we're just watching it go on without being able to do anything.


All of this to lead into me asking, is the UK better than the US with trans rights? I'm half British and have family there so I can easily move there. I wouldn't have to worry about where I'd live or anything bc of that too. But ik that there's been some transphobic shit going on there too. But is it really as bad as the US rn? Bc I feel like we're almost going towards genocide at this point. 

I technically do have another option, which is to stay in Australia. I have family there (they're also originally from the UK) but it would be harder for me to move there legally/permanently it could probably work for a while. And if I really liked it I like I could end up moving there. The thing is, is Australia that better than the UK when it comes to trans rights? Bc if so I wouldn't mind having to live there.

I just really want to know from other trans ppl what the situation is like at home if you're from the UK or AU and if you think it's better than the US"	"Spain is pretty nice especially Catalonia.

But I'm not sure how it will be after the summer, we're headed to a legendary drought if nothing changes...
Seeing how bad it's getting in some places makes me wish I could invite everyone to Belgium, sure there's some people that aren't that accepting but the laws and regulations are good and keep getting better. Dammit now I'm sad. Stay strong everyone.
Please please please do not come to England. While they may not be as hostile to trans people as the US yet, laws are being put in place right now against trans people. If you do come to the UK, consider Scotland. I haven't been too involved in this topic recently but I believe that they are removing laws against trans people although they have received a lot of backlash for this. Do what you think is best but please read up on the new UK laws.
Yeah I seen UK seems to not be the answer. Personally considering canada if I could get in. Australia is a good choice I believe if I recheck my chart I have been building. I thought UK shot down Scotlands attempt to remove laws and make it more friendly. Could be wrong but yeah be careful and make sure to read up.
Are there really ways for normal people to move to other countries? Any country with a better standard of living seems to have a hefty pay wall or really marketable skills needed to make the move.
100% these are my exact feelings. I live in Minnesota, and we are very safe, as far as the US goes, but WE ARE IN A GENOCIDE. There are 10 stages and we are currently at stage 8. From what I have seen, Germany Spain and the Netherlands seem to be the top three prospects.
The netherlands os and has always been very accepting towards LGBTQ+ people with for example being the first country where gay marriage was allowed
Both are better than the us for trans rights but the uk from what I heard is starting to head in the direction the us is Canada and Australia are offering to take in trans refugees
It is not so much a matter of country as of city. I know that the friendliest cities are Berlin, London, and Barcelona as far as Europe is concerned
Iv thought about going to Australia but i think just moving to another part of us would be better
I would say Nevada or California. I am not open about who i am but i have experience living in both places and its really chill there
NGL, Spain and Portugal would be my go-to options for moving to if all my friends and family didn't live in Mexico and the USA XD
I went to Belgium for my honeymoon before my egg cracked, and it was a wonderful place. I am so glad to hear that it remains a place that I can safely visit again.
England has vetoed trans-positive laws in Scotland, the first time they've vetoed *any* law in 25 years. Don't come to the UK
Yeah I was thinking how I could move to a country like Canada, but I barley have enough money to live NOW. Unfortunately I still live in a Republican state, but I just moved to the biggest city in the state and so far it‚Äôs been better.
Plus the food and landscape there is just fire !
Yeah, Belgium has always been a live and let live country, especially in cities, sure there's some close minded people but sadly I think you'll always have those. Glad you had a good time though, there's some really nice places to see in Belgium, if you don't mind cloudy weather.
wow really? that's actually shocking thank you for adding this :)
I mean so is here in Mexico, that said they do have something Mexico doesn't, they're EXTREMELY safe (even more so by comparison)
I figure that no matter where you go there will always be some less than pleasant people, but yeah while I was there every person I interacted with was very kind and just willing to talk. We stayed at a small hotel in Ghent that was run by a lovely husband and wife. They made home-cooked breakfast every morning and would ask us about our day any time we got back for the evening. 

Your train system is so great too, like we stayed in Ghent but we also went to Bruges and Antwerp (twice). It was so nice not having to feel stuck in one place or having to go through the hassle of renting a car and driving everywhere.
Oh yeah, no, I wasn't implying that Mexico didn't have that.

It's just that I have never been to Mexico, but I've been to Portugal and Spain, so I didn't want to talk about something I didn't know about
Yeah, those are definitely some of the nicer cities, Hasselt and Oostende are also good, though they take a bit longer to reach with public transport. Don't know a lot about the situation in the Ardennes, but from what little I know it seems like they're about the same as Flanders. The only city I'd warn about is Brussels, some parts are fine but some get pretty bad, though it's bad there for most people, riddled with crime and zero effort to improve the situation there which is just sad. 

As far as trains go, you have a very different opinion compared to the average Belgian, though I think they're mostly just spoiled, they don't get that with such a dense railroad infrastructure you're always going to end up with some problems like delays and such. That and people here have a tendency to walk on the tracks which can cause serious delays.
Nah you're fine, I knew you were talking about only Portugal and Spain, I just wanted to add that Mexico also has those to accentuate the fact that Mexico (and the USA for that fact) aren't even CLOSE to comparable in terms of safety
I mean, yeah, from what I've heard, Spain and Portugal are really good safe places
Portugal is #6 top safest country and Spain is #29 but the people are extremely nice (if a bit too extroverted for my introverted brain XD)
Yeah, each I went there, and it felt pretty welcoming !

I'd love to return, especially to Portugal
All I'm missing is learning Portuguese to go there comfortably tbh XD
If you know English you'll be fine, just avoid the tiny villages, even if they are the prettiest üòÖ
Yeah, thing is I know Spanish and learning a 3rd language is going to also be a massive asset in terms of job stuff
I mean, that's a good point !

I wanted to learn Portuguese to talk with my grandma (she is Portuguese and very, very, very old, too old to remember any French)

But I couldn't keep it up sadly, but I'm thinking about trying again

However the platform I was learning from only has Brazilian portuguese and not well Portuguese portuguese
Funny thing people don't think much about, if you give the embassy of a country a call and ask for options, they will give you options for a teacher of their language
Damn I really didn't know that ! Nor thought about it
Yeah like, just calling the embassy is an amazing step forward to learning a language by simply going out of your comfort zone and talking to someone else, even if through a phone call or email
Yup, that's already a good start ! It super hard. I used to struggle to say one word in English to my boyfriend. Now, it just feels normal
Exactly! I had the good luck (or misfortune depending on how you look at it) of both English and Spanish being a requirement for me to be able to move up in school years starting with pre-elementary school XD
Oh wow, in France you have to learn English (mandatory) and chose between Spanish and German but jesus you don't ""learn"" Spanish, like, no one get out of a French school knowing how to speak Spanish üòÇ
I mean, to be fair, I live in Mexico, so Spanish is a given, the one that doesn't make sense is English, and later on you're required by the Education department to also learn either Latin, Greek, or Greko-Roman Roots
You have to ? I didn't know that !  What did you choose ?

In France, you can learn Latin or Greek (Greek is way less common), but it's kind of dying, like you'd have 10 classmates, and that's it
Well, I didn't have a choice, usually the school chooses for you, and it's usually Greko-Roman Roots, I got Latin XD
Oh it sucks that they don't give you a choice :/
I mean, it's more so how much the school is willing to pay a teacher for a class, so it ends up being like ""can your school afford the cool languages or the bare minimum?"" XD
Yeah, we get that a lot with German teachers here 

In my high school, they had to keep a teacher who was basically harassing students, cause they had no other teacher
Nah, for us it's more like ""well, since this teacher is an ass we're just going to change to a cheaper teacher and see how the students do"" XD

>\*Insert phony 5th grade biology ""science""\* incoming on other social media/subreddits I guess, lol.

I thought we were pretty much past the point of debating whether or not there's a physical advantage retained after transitioning (science unfortunately said yes there is). How big it is in MMA is another question though, might not be as much of an advantage as in e.g. association football.
That's not what science says at all actually, but thanks for inserting your phony 5th grade faux biology misinformation.
That's exactly what science says. In athletics the advantage is particularly big, that's an indisputable fact no matter how much we wished it weren't
I should also point out that Alana got rocked pretty hard in this fight, and won by submission. In other words, she won with technical ability, not pure strength
There's actually no definitive evidence to state that at all. Sources please??

 But bonus points for repeatedly stating this as basic fact that everyone knows.
That's actually kinda self contradicting. She kept taking punch after punch to no effect, but was able to use the strength advantage to grapple her to submission despite being technically inferior

Don't epilate your nads or bits, though!
Yeah, epilators are really only good for legs, and even then I probably wouldn‚Äôt go too far above the knee. For everything else, I use either a Phillips bodygroomer (it‚Äôs essentially a beard trimmer and electric razor combo) or Nair. If you‚Äôre looking to make your hair temporarily softer when it starts coming back, Nair might be what you‚Äôre looking for. Just be careful with it.

(TW: Transphobia) I'm so fucking tired of having to tirelessly explain how some things are transphobic, even to cis allies, while they downplay the transphobia	"i genuinely cant even trust cis allies who say stuff like ""trans rights"" anymore because it's really starting to reach that stage where cis people say it to avoid confronting their own transphobia

&#x200B;

recently i vented on a different trans sub about how there were so many TERF dogwhistles on the subreddit r/actuallylesbian and someone (who i genuinely knew to be one of the most trans-inclusive cis people i know) messaged me out of the blue complaining about the fact that i was disappointed that she agreed with a post saying: ""it's lonely to be a cis person""

&#x200B;

she asked why i brought her into my vent about transphobia, and instead of just listening to me she either downplayed or even \*defended\* the transphobic dog whistles on the r/Actuallylesbian sub

there were posts on that sub with hundreds of upvotes complaining about being banned for ""saying the difference between males and females"", including the \*top most voted post of all time\*, and she didn't see anything suspicious about that at all

  
I even tried explaining to her that virtually no-one gets banned for doing that, it's such a small issue, and the fact this stuff gets way more attention than actual bigotry on that sub is a result of transphobia, whether we're willing to admit this or not

&#x200B;

Instead, she downplayed it by saying ""people get banned for all sorts of reasons"" and ""well i need proof that she actually said something transphobic""

despite me being angry and tired I tried to explain the transphobia that was weighing me down, and she refused to even try and see it from my perspective  


This was almost 2 weeks ago, but I recently decided to look through the post history of one of the ""i got banned for males vs females"" posts with a clear mind, specifically a post that she asked for proof of transphobia for, and guess fucking what? it was bigoted as fuck!  


it was a comment on a dysphoric woman questioning if she was a man (she ended up discovering she wasn't a man, but this was clearly at a time where she was questioning her gender) in one of the lines of the post she specifically said ""I just want to wake up in a 6'2 male body"" 

And the fucking commenter replied by saying ""In 40 years, I don't think you would take an aging 6'2'' male body,  with creaky joints, back pain, and belly fat, over a nimble 5'2'' female  body. Female bodies are essentially optimized for longevity, which is a  win for you.""

THE COMMENTER BASICALLY DOWNPLAYED HER POTENTIAL EUPHORIA OVER A MAN'S BODY WHILE SHE WAS DYSPHORIC, AND THEN THE COMMENTER HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY ""oh i was banned for saying the difference between males and females boohoo""

&#x200B;

IT MAKES ME SO GODAMN ANGRY WHEN PEOPLE FALL FOR THESE POSTS WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE CONTEXT  
SHE WASNT BANNED FOR PREACHING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES, SHE WAS BANNED FOR USING THAT AS A WAY TO DOWNPLAY SOMEONE'S GENDER DYSPHORIA, CONTEXT FUCKING MATTERS

&#x200B;

I SHOULDNT HAVE TO DIG THIS FAR INTO SOMEONES POST HISTORY JUST TO PROVE THAT A VERY OBVIOUS TERF DOGWHISTLE POST WAS ACTUALLY POSTED BY SOMEONE TRANSPHOBIC  
I SHOULDNT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS MUCH EFFORT JUST FOR SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO ME ON TRANS ISSUES

Have you ever heard of ""How to Talk to a Science Denier""? It's a book by Lee McIntyre, mainly about how to talk to people who have baseless opinions. Might be useful? My mother enjoyed it.
if they‚Äôre all about ‚Äúscience‚Äù, show them scientific studies. the best ones are on google scholar.
Unfortunately doesn't sound like you're going to be able to.
I hope your parents find it in themselves to accept you. That would be absolutely wonderful, but I think it's important to accept that they never accept you.

I came out a little more than 2 years ago, and my relationship with my parents ended the day I came out. I've only seen them once since, and I suspect that I will never see them again (or I'll see them extremely rarely).

From what I've heard from my siblings, my parents have gotten worse and more bitter and angry.

I held in to hope for a while and tried to have text conversations with them a couple of times to discuss it, but it always devolved into arguments.

I've given up hope on them.

...

All this to say, I feel for you, and if you need to talk I respond to DMs.

I hope your parents accept you sooner rather than later.

Utmost props to NJ on Birth Certificate change!	"So, I had the mis(?)fortune of being born in New Jersey (let the jokes commence), but now, at 40 years old, I finally experienced one truly great thing:  their Birth Certificate amendment process.

For one, it cost me only $43 for name change, gender marker change, and 5 extra copies (for a total of 6).

Secondly, all they need is a court order for the name change and ***self-attestation*** for the gender marker change - no therapist/doctor's sign-off required at all!

Third, it took only 28 days from mailing the form in to getting the new BC back in the mail.  In terms of government offices getting things done, I consider this a massive win.

But, here's the big one: ***the new certificate doesn't say the word ""Amended"" anywhere on it!*** It even has the same original ""filed with registrar"" date....for all intents and purposes, I was legally born a woman!

I am absolutely over the moon right now.  If anyone was born in NJ and was hesitating about doing this part of the process, don't....just go for it!

That is all.  Back to our regularly scheduled resistance to fascism."	"Badass! Good to hear it went oh so right, sister!
nj is super trans friendly. probably one of the only things i like about living here.
Ah dang! I was born in NJ 41 years ago... I am so, so glad to hear how easy it is, because I'm starting the process this year! And grabs to you for getting it done!
Thanks!

Alright, so... How does one explain this? [WARNING: Excessively Long]	"So, I didn‚Äôt realize I might potentially be gender dysphoric until what, a year or 2 ago? I didn‚Äôt even know the term existed for a while to be honest. I think it‚Äôs been in my subconscious for a lot of my life, because I‚Äôve always felt this slight unease every time I saw my reflection, or when I went to the bathroom, or just general day to day actions. I think online roleplay helped me realize something was going on, because for some strange reason, I only felt comfortable as female roles. The few times I was male in roleplay, I was not comfortable with it. Thoughts started conjuring up in my head occasionally, like ‚Äúwhy do I want to be girl characters all the time?‚Äù I even thought about scenarios about how ‚Äúthings would‚Äôve been better if I were born a female.‚Äù It occurred to me I wanted to be them in reality, but I only figured out the true depth of my issue when my closest online friend said that I always did come off as ‚Äúfeminine,‚Äù and he assumed I was actually a girl until I stated otherwise. 

That‚Äôs when it hit me. I **wanted** to be a girl... I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a more shocking revelation in just about my entire life, but it felt like something in me was awoken, and it was by no means a bad moment. With this turning point also came an impending wave of absolute doubt. I started looking it up, and looked at the symptoms of gender dysphoria. I know I‚Äôve always felt a little uncomfortable being male, but my childhood seemed totally normal, in fact pretty typical for a boy. I got all the nerf guns, rocked all the monster movies, and played baseball up until middle school! In fact I am a gamer, and pride myself in being one (even if it‚Äôs mostly just TF2, lol). I‚Äôm not saying I regret these actions, but... I began to suspect my ‚Äúfeminine self‚Äù is hidden under a highly deep wall of insecurities which is why I seemed so ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in the first place. I‚Äôve always felt just a bit different, enough to set me at unease. Yet, somehow? I‚Äôm still ashamed of myself, and hid all of these desires away. Many discouraging thoughts run through my head daily.. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt feminine enough.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour parents wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just being selfish, with your desires.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you even dysphoric? Or are you making yourself believe you are?‚Äù It crushed my confidence, for a while, and I refused to admit it to anyone until recently. I‚Äôve been gaining *at least ENOUGH* confidence, and I‚Äôve confessed I wanted to be a female to a couple friends in marching band now. All of them are accepting about it, and it felt like a big relief! But... I feel uncertain I‚Äôm in the right direction. As if there‚Äôs this ominous abominable wall stopping me, a block, a preventative thought. And well... That thought, is that I‚Äôm just wrong. Wrong that I think this way, wrong that I may not be the handsome man my parents want me to be, wrong that I have been willing to go this far. It‚Äôs this big mental war, and it‚Äôs really hard to tell which side is going to win. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here of course! So... what are *your* thoughts on all this? *Should* I tell my parents about it? Feel free to be as brutally honest as humanly possible!"	"Oof, not sure what to say beyond just that I relate immensely. Most of what you said describes me quite well, so you're certainly not alone. :)
This honestly describes me down to a T, even the bit about marching band lol
The main thing to keep in mind is that you do what you want when you feel ready to. That being said, I did not come out to my parents until I spoke to a therapist about it. I also got in touch with people who have already started transition and had long discussions with them about how I felt, conversations that a comment cannot do justice too. By feeling more confident in how I felt about myself, coming out to my parents was easier.
You don't even know how relatable your whole experience is to me T.T I am going through and went through everything you said. It was only this past month when I finally shook off my doubts and accepted that my feelings for myself are true and that I'm only hurting myself by denying them. I told my parents very quickly because I hoped they would understand and help me through it, but although they said they supported me remarks like ""Why do you wear feminine pants when they don't make you look like a girl."" really hurt me and the fact that they don't want me to do or try anything with hrt until they're ready has put a strain on our relationship. Personally I think that you should follow your heart and brain on whether to tell your parents or not, your feelings and well-being are more important than their approval of you.
I imagine you‚Äôll have a number of people telling you their experiences mirror yours in a number of ways, myself included. I imagine a lot of those experiences are fairly universal for trans folk, regardless of whatever other demographics they fit into (example: I‚Äôm nearly 40, something I find noteworthy as a lot of trans people on here seem to be much younger, probably because when I was your age, it wasn‚Äôt something people talked about. Regardless, a lot of the experiences you‚Äôre talking about are the same ones I had. I just a late start, presumably because I didn‚Äôt have the benefit of it being as visible as it is today.)
Well, it‚Äôs a relief some people out there are going through the same thing! Cheers! *Although also not cheers because it kinda sucks...* **but cheers!**
Really? Hah! What section are you in? I‚Äôm a mellophone!
Understood! That‚Äôs pretty much what I‚Äôm aiming for in the short term, around a couple months or so. I‚Äôm going to try to get that confidence I need to really open up. I don‚Äôt know if it will take months, or even a year (my goal is at the end of marching band season), but I‚Äôm going to stick to that goal until I find myself able to talk about it with them. This comment honestly helped, and I will try to reach out to other people about my endeavor. Thanks!
...I think I actually needed to hear that to be honest. I‚Äôve been living essentially my whole life pressured to conform **or else.** Had a past where my problems often weren‚Äôt recognized by my parents and I was bad at explaining them. Often this always built up to tense moments where I just vaguely blurt out what‚Äôs bothering me, which ends either fine, or bad. This most recent revelation with my inner femininity has not only been amazing, but also extremely daunting. It will be a journey for me, that‚Äôs for sure! This really reminded me that the top priority, is my needs, not my parents.. *Thanks a lot!*
Yeah, I can see that now to be honest.
Nice! Mellophone in high school, trumpet in college/drum corps
Cool! Tbh the only reason I‚Äôm a mellophone is because one of the players last year went to front ensemble to play electric bass, so since none of the other trumpets owned up to replacing him, I did. I loved that decision.
I'm a snare! And what you described above is exactly how I felt/feel. The biggest thing to remember is that a lot of people feel this way. I was afraid that I was wrong about being trans because I thought I was the only one who didn't ""hate"" being my birth gender; it was just unsettling. I think r/egg_irl is great for that, because it is full of people that feel the same way."	d50s9y	trans	8	0.8	2019-09-16 13:38:12
Anyone else have fantasies about people accepting them?	"Here‚Äôs what I mean by that. Like, whenever I‚Äôm in a card aisle of a store, I look at the cards for guys and imagine my family giving me one for like my birthday or something with my real name (August) on it. I know it‚Äôll never happen, but I think about it and stuff like that a lot. 

Or sometimes I imagine fictional characters telling me it‚Äôs okay to be trans and helping me with stuff. Just being treated like a guy.

I guess I escape to these fantasies because no one currently accepts me. 

Sometimes I also think about getting in an argument with my grandparents about trans people and winning, and then they use my pronouns and stuff. (You can‚Äôt really convince these people, but y‚Äôknow.)"

My first day out facing the public Pt. 2	"So after my positive experience this morning I was feeling brave so I decided to go  out to a super cool new bar in Mystic, CT.  It‚Äôs a queer owned Bar/Restaurant called Port of Call.  It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúgay‚Äù bar but they do a drag night every other Sunday. They opened earlier this year. So as I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm sitting at a bar made from wood from a 1800‚Äôs whaling ship and enjoying an excellent gin and tonic. I‚Äôve also already gotten complements from the bar tender about my nails and earrings. I‚Äôm really doing it, living the dream.

The whole main floor is set up to feel like the captain‚Äôs quarters of a fine yacht.  Then downstairs in the  basement they have the bar called Dive. It‚Äôs literally the dive bar. Lol

Loving my outfit tonight. I‚Äôm channeling my inner  old school Oxford professor. Black leather heeled ankle boots, dark brown corduroy pants, a super cute lacy cream colored top, and a hunter green corduroy blazer with elbow patches and a silk lining with hunting dogs. Add a dash of hair and makeup and a splash of jewelry/ dangly earrings and out the door I go. It really fits the vibe of the restaurant with its varnished mahogany and walnut with ox blood red leather upholstery. Lol

It was actually a great experience. 

When I got there the owner (lesbian) was working the front desk and could obviously tell I‚Äôm trans (only 9 month in and in my 30‚Äôs so not passable really at all but I try my best) and looked a bit nervous. So she said, hi hun you doing ok? Reading that she knew what was going on, I told her it was my first time out. She was super excited for me and walked with me over to the bar and asked me what I was having, I told her gin and tonic. She waved the bartender over, (Big Jason Mamoa looking dude) he said, evening miss, and the owner said she'll have a gin and tonic. Affirmation overload.... lol. We sat and talked for a bit. Once she saw I was ok she left. I had a couple more drinks then headed home. I'd call that a resounding win!!!"		x70kzx	trans	9	0.92	2022-09-06 04:06:53

Body swapping between trans people	"If you could trade bodies with other trans people, that would make everything so much easier.  I'm trans female pre-transition and see a lot of trans males pre-transition and think ""I wish I had their body"" and they're talking about ""I wish I had a guy's body,"" so we could just trade and it'd be a win-win, everybody is happy"	"every trans girl has had a conversation about that with a trans boy
Mhm. Would be pretty awesome.
Similarly, how cool would it be if we could actually transplant body parts? I‚Äôm so excited for my (FtX) top surgery and I‚Äôve made peace with throwing away my breast tissue, but they are objectively nice breasts and it‚Äôs a bit of a shame that they couldn‚Äôt be properly enjoyed; I wish I could magically give them to a transfem person who would feel euphoria from them!
God I wish this was possible 
congrats on getting that surgery, super happy for you :)
Thanks! <3"	9rgyew	trans	9	0.91	2018-10-26 02:51:05
I'm done	" 

I ‚Äôm done. I just am going to give up trying to transition anymore. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I do, or what makeup I use, I will always be seen as a freak! I was a fool to even think this was going to work. I have to realize that I‚Äôm going to have to learn to live with what I have done to myself and pay the price for it. I dealt with the dysphoria for 48 years. Ill just have to get used to that pain I was living with again. Thank you to those who supported me and encouraged me. To those who wished me Dead or otherwise, now you get your wish. Because of the hate I have been fighting against for so long it has just worn me down to nothing . I have nothing left to fight with. You win, I lose.

This is a burn account. If you want to  message me you can I will answer"	"You have no post history to go off of.  Are you on hormones or are you just wearing women‚Äôs clothes and makeup?  If you‚Äôre on HRT, how long?  Is surgery an option?  I went through a visibly trans phase, we all do.  It‚Äôs not easy but it‚Äôs something we deal with and many of us make it through and eventually start passing.  Some people require surgery if they want to pass or to help with dysphoria that cannot go away from the HRT (such as certain facial structures).
You can‚Äôt let these fuckers win. Transphobes are part of the most evil motherfuckers on the planet. They are objectively wrong about you no matter what they say. 

It‚Äôs a long process, but I promise you it‚Äôs worth it. If you stop, you‚Äôll regret it for the rest of your life, and you‚Äôve already fought so much.

Keep going. Please.
Don't listen to those stupid fucking transphobes. Please don't give up. I know those people can be a handful, but you have us to support you. Stay strong, please. I'd also like to say, I attempted suicide a few years ago.

I think I'm ready to identify as trans	"My memories from when I was like 5-14 are really hazy I don't remember very much about back then, but some of the things I do remember were moments where I felt distinctly feminine. There was this time where my sisters friends came over and dressed me up in this cinderella dress and put body glitter all over me. There was something embarrassing, something really exciting about it. I remember I saw myself and I really liked the idea of being a princess. I felt like I had to act as though I didn't like it, but what I really wanted was to wear that dress all day. There was another time where Toontown got glitched and it let my character wear a skirt. These were little things that weren't little at all to me. I used to lie awake at night thinking about what it would be like to be a girl, I wasn't sure that I wanted to be a girl. It was really hard to be sure. I didn't and still don't hate my body. Reading about people who identified as trans made me unsure if I qualified. I wondered if I was perhaps better described by the label of crossdresser or simply as a boy who likes girly things. So I sort've had this feeling of confusion about what I was and what I wanted to be. In highschool I became a fairly athletic guy and I fell in love with sports. Because I had abilities associated with the fact that I was born a boy that complicated things for me. On the one hand, I was winning a swimming event as a boy, and then on the other hand I was doing powderpuff and secretly wishing that I could be the girl that I was ""pretending"" to be. So I didn't know how to weigh those two things. I felt like I couldn't be a boy athlete(which was important to me) and a transgirl. I've spent college grappling with that and thinking about how maybe I could be both. I told my girlfriend of two years that I might be trans first. She told me that that was difficult for her and that she felt like she couldn't love someone who felt like a girl because she didn't like girls. That was really sad, but I was glad that I told someone. I finally told someone!! So fast forward a bit and now I'm 20 going on 21 and I think that I'm ready to identify as trans. I want to start presenting femininely and I want to be called by she/her pronouns. I don't want to go on Hrt. I just want the world to see me the way I see me, as a lesbian chick with a dick named zoey. Sorry this was so long if you got to the end thank you:)"	"I‚Äôm so happy for you Zoey! Live your best life!!!
Thank you for sharing your story üòä I feel this so much I also have recently accepted that I am trans (I'm 28 now) after a very similar childhood with liking to get dressed up by the neighborhood girls as a ""game"" to lying awake with those same thoughts. But realizing myself letting Lizzie out and knowing where I want to go with my transition (I plan on starting HRT when/if possible) has finally made me happy and I can finally say I am a proud trans woman.

i‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because i‚Äôve become more comfortable with the idea of being in a relationship as a girl so i instantly have a crush on literally anyone who is hot or has similar hobbies and interests as me and it‚Äôs so crazy, like i‚Äôve never experienced this before and it‚Äôs kinda fun.

I want to hear your thoughts on writing a trans girl as a child.	"I'm writing a fantasy novel, and I'm cis. I know how annoying these questions sometimes are on these subreddits-- we get them over at r/actuallesbians all the time, and they always make me cringe for a couple reasons. First, you never know whether the writer is trying to be fake woke or tokenizing or whether they're fetishizing you or trying to win diversity points. Second, it always feels pretentious to say ""I'm writing a fantasy novel."" Maybe that's just me. Third, there's tons of resources out there for writers trying to create characters who are not cis, white, male, etc, and it seems presumptuous to ask strangers on the internet to do your research for you instead of just doing it yourself.

I have to imagine that there are people on this sub who feel the same irritation as I do at these kinds of questions, so I apologize. I truly appreciate your thoughts and your help with this. When I'm finished writing, I plan to give my first draft to a bunch of my trans writer friends to test-read for sensitivity (and also like, grammar and plot holes and stuff) but before I even do that, I'd really like to ask for help from strangers on the internet. To help me lay some groundwork for this character.

You might be able to tell that I'm super self-conscious; I just really want to do a good job and do this character justice. I don't want to overstep my bounds, or write something that's going to hurt someone. Especially my friends.

The story is about a group of childhood friends who grow up together over the course of the novel. There's a portal through the stars to a magical country, and they have an adventure, but that's neither here nor there. They start out around 10 years old and they're all queer in some way (but none of them really know that yet). My POV protagonist is a cis girl named Stella, and her best friend (and eventual love interest) is Ivy, who is trans.

I've had this story in my head for a really long time. It's important to me that Ivy is in the story as a child, and grows into herself over time along with the other protagonists. The issue here is that, at 10 years old, Ivy isn't presenting as a girl. 

I know that there's ways to change the narrative so that Ivy has always presented as a girl to her friends and knows her own pronouns and knows who she is so that I don't have to deal with misgendering my own character for the first couple chapters. But that's not who Ivy is-- she's uncertain of herself in the beginning, she's got a really absent-minded professor vibe. She's shy and sensitive and she'd lose her own nose if it wasn't on her face. She's kind of a push-over at the start but she learns to be more confident as the story goes on. Her character arc is learning to take the reins and call the shots when she knows she's in the right. 

That's why I think it's important to the story that she doesn't really know who she's supposed to be at a young age. 

Obviously, as a cis person I already feel like I'm way stepping over my bounds. Since the readers are looking at Ivy's arc through Stella's eyes, in the earliest parts of the story, Stella would use he/him pronouns and a masculine name when she talks to and about Ivy. And since *I* know that Ivy's trans, even though *she* doesn't, I'm uncomfortable with that. 

When Ivy comes out, Stella will be supportive and the narrative voice will correctly gender that character.

Her being trans isn't her whole story arc. I don't want to make it seem that way. Her story arc is about being a shy nerd who takes control, stops an evil scientist from summoning the Old Gods, and falls in love with her best friend. But I do really want her to be trans. The shape of the story is in my head already.

I'm afraid of writing this character pre-transition in a way that is offensive, hurtful, wrong, or could be misconstrued by cis readers as ""oh she's starts the story as a boy so she's really a boy"". I don't want people to believe that since the *narrator* misgenders her as a child, the *narrative* misgenders her.

If I want to play it completely safe, I could cut the character completely, but I think that would be worse from an allyship standpoint and also completely ruin my story. I don't want to just *avoid* the character altogether, or avoid transness as a part of her identity.

I want to write this story the way I have it in my head. But I also want to be sensitive and not do a shitty job or build something that feels wrong. The whole reason I want to write Ivy this way-- starting off presenting one way and then transitioning-- is because growing up, I had friends who I knew as one gender and then as we grew up they transitioned and I knew them by new names and new pronouns but still as the same friends. And since my friends are such an important part of *my* life experiences, I want to reflect some of that into my story. I want to give my friends a cool character with something in common with them. I don't want to fuck it up. The story is supposed to be a celebration of my childhood friendships and I don't want to do it without Ivy.

I'd like to know what people on this sub think. How do I handle this character? Am I going about this the right way? How can I do this better? If you were writing this story, how would you handle the narration? How would you write about her as a child? 

I really appreciate all your thoughts and help. Again, sorry to be the ""I'm writing a fantasy novel, tell me how to write X minority group"" person on the sub. I wouldn't normally impose like this but I really don't want to fuck this up."		hov6lr	trans	10	1.0	2020-07-10 19:15:24
